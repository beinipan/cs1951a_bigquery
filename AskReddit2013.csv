Take [this](http://redd.it/192yqa) thread. 34,000 upvotes is a pretty good amount number, but there's also a downside: 31,000 downvotes. The more people that upvote a post, the more people that downvote it. It is more visible to more people, more people will hate it.


Of course, there are the very successful posts that are able to amass 30,000-50,000 upvotes, but the total karma that they reap is only at 5000-6000 because of the similar amount of downvotes.

Even though it has 240,000+ upvotes, it is only the 3rd highest scoring post of all time because of the downvotes.


It is the same thing with comments, but on a smaller scale. More upvotes, more visibility, more downvotes. The best comments typically get 2000-3000 upvotes.


Another thing is people simply *don't want* to upvote posts. It may be just a seconds to do, but posts are usually held to a higher standard than comments.

Oh, and James never paid for it since the ""insult"" charge was recognized only by Chinese and Japanese laws. Geller himself said that he didn't try to get that money from Randi. Randi also stated that he never paid a dollar to anyone who sued him.

It's probably because the only reason Uri Geller had any chance in court was not ""slander"" but ""insult"". Slander would be insulting someone without any basis.

A lie is deliberate. You have to prove the INTENTION. Otherwise how do you tell the difference between a lie and someone being misinformed? Exactly, innocent until proven guilty.

&gt;huge chunk of internal and external traffic is a domestic spying program

It is not internal traffic. It says it in the article, foreign-to-domestic, that's EXTERNAL. AKA Foreign comms.

&gt;Abuse in this context is a mistake that is not corrected

Abuse is a violation of people's rights intentionally, with motive. In the legal context. The context you are using, is very broad and thus then you agree that it is NOT a legal abuse and therefore, it is not illegal.

&gt; for 3 years, finding this out, and then saying ""what the heck, let's just keep all the data in our database and mine it anyway"".

They can't. They delete material every year. There's audit trails. They weren't even illegally tapping anything either (or is this another ""unique interpretation"" of wiretapping? Because someone was saying that phone conversations are not the only ""tap"" when it clearly is).

&gt;Just not the oversight committee. Which is obviously the part that matters for the purposes of overseeing the NSA. 

Just because all of them haven't met, doesn't mean they aren't doing their job. And it's all the more reason to support Obama, stop accusing him of lying, and getting Democrats into House so that you can remove the Republicans who are in charge of that.

&gt;(unless we use your definition of a lie, in which case it was just an accident or mistake).

But yours was intentional, in that you were trying to pinpoint blame at HIC for not meeting when it had.

&gt;. given that it is the same link to the same article I'd linked earlier in the post.

Either time I couldn't access it. There is no article. You click article, nothing comes up.

&gt;Most people believe that they can't, as this would be illegal, 

Because they can't. They don't have that access. Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and a plethora of other corporations have not given up that kind of access or files. If there's no warrant, how can they access THEIR servers?

&gt;Now this I find most amusing, as someone who is a socialist liberal and loves big gov...

Yes and you've been duped by Rand Paul, Edward, Glenn Greenwald, and others who have a hard on for hating Obama and big gov. I'm surprised you can't see through these lies and are adamant that something sinister and evil is afoot by the very people you probably voted for. Yet you take Glenn and Edwards word, despite them lacking evidence (which I have shown you the broad interpretations they use to write these articles), but you don't take the people you trusted into office.

Link me more links. Keep them coming, I have reviewed them all. You will not surprise me on any of these. I'm waiting for you to link to the latest one, the one that has a serious error in the article.

&gt;Which wasn't material. But keep believing everything is all just fine if that makes you feel better...

It doesn't. What makes me feel bad is the fact that so many people on the internet are so easily duped by gish-gallop conspiracy-theory techniques of flooding people with NSA articles that don't have much content or evidence.

Don't give up. Keep at it. Aside from a few mistakes/lies (lies based on your interpretation the same way you accused gov officials), you are at least doing the research and looking for supporting articles. That's more than what many others have tried.

Who knows, maybe you find that one article that finally convinces me that there is a sinister plot to eavesdrop into your facebook messages and personal emails to your chain-letter-buddies despite being totally innocent.

Also, if you elect for private insurance, expect the costs to go as high as double for men and about 60% more for women than what you're currently paying.

I'll probably get blasted for saying this, but Obama care truly needs to be abolished in it's current form.

That, and/or they tend to adopt a ""do as I say, not as I do"" attitude -- for example, talking about civility in discourse (i.e. after the Arizona shooting) and then going on to use some of the ugliest language possible against Republicans. Other facets are basically ensconced in the other points of my essay; I think they all sort of trace back to this one, though.

2.) **Stereotyping.** No, simply because I am a Republican does not mean that I am an old, greedy, racist, misogynist, gun-toting, Bible-thumping, Fox-watching, truck-driving, uneducated redneck. Granted, yes: I am white, male, a (mostly non-practicing) Catholic, a member of the NRA, and someone who has spent the latter half of his *21* years of life in Virginia (central, not up in the mountains). But I don't watch Fox, I'm studying engineering at a fairly rigorous institution of higher learning, and I think people deserve to be treated equally. Hell, I even drive a Volvo (not a renowned maker of trucks). These sorts of (wildly inaccurate) generalizations on the part of the liberals only serve to distance people from whatever discussion they were having, distracting people from civil discourse -- and they also make libs looks like royal douchebags, which leads directly into:

3.) **Snobbery/Smugness/Etc.** Every time you try to have a discussion with a liberal, they basically point out their opinions as if those opinions were fact, then stereotype you for disagreeing with them. Holier-than-thou attitudes don't make your opinions any more correct than mine are -- neither of them can be ""correct"" at all, given that they are opinions. (This also is one of my biggest beefs with atheists, might I add.)

4.) **Nonsensical Positions.** One that comes to mind due to recent events: gun control and how they go about attempting to enforce it. Placing restrictions on things that have no affect on how the gun actually shoots will not magically make guns any safer. Hell, quite a few gun owners try to make their guns look ""cooler"" by adding military-style paraphernalia -- foregrips, mil-spec scopes, etc. None of these make a semi-automatic rifle (one bullet per trigger pull) any more dangerous. I personally don't feel the need to make my one firearm (a shotgun) look like a military weapon, but even if I did, it wouldn't make it any more dangerous -- it might *look* more dangerous, but since looks can't kill....

I'm not saying Republicans are perfect either, for reference. I think that's it for now. Enough essay writing. **TL;DR** If liberals want conservatives to stop seeming so ""angry"" all the time, maybe they should stop being dicks so the conservatives would have less to be angry about. Then we can all work together and get shit fixed.

**EDDIT:** I would like to thank you, Good Mr./Mrs. G0VERNMENT, for encouraging civil dialogue. If places like r/politics were to follow your example, maybe reddit can become a more constructive place to generate solutions to the problems we face, instead of the whole cirque-jerque it is now.",5

"Im going to karma hell for this, but your comment is pretty relevant. Im currently reading 'The Rise and The Fall of the 3rd Riech' and the amount of similarites between just the first chapter and Obama's policies over the last 5 years is *very* high.

Edit: Not sure if people think I'm sarcastic, but in a half-hour or so I'll get my book (not at my house) and provide some examples. Many people don't realize that not everything in the book is about genocide and outrageous acts. There are many 'subtle' things, as Anal_Explorer says. Again, I'll deliver in a few.

**Edit 2:** Sadly I wont be at my house for the rest of the night, but I do have some examples off the top of my head (from the book, but not exact quotes).

* Social Security: Hitler initiated a social security program that was far more radical than any other country of the time, taking advantage of lower class people's slowing reliance on social security. He also took out massive loans in part to pay for this. 

* As someone else mentioned, Gestapo-NSA. Obviously the Gestapo was far more serious than the NSA but hey, they had to start somewhere.

* This applies to mostly to all politicians, but extensively for Obama. Hitler  widely used charismatic oratory to convince people, offering hope and pandering to certain groups. Even during his rule he campaigned furiously, exactly as Obama has been doing (more so earlier in the year) ""Whipping up frenzies"" (a quote I remember from the book). 

* Hitler transformed national suffering into political support for his own good. Something that has *really* made me furious at Obama, Sandy Hook. Shortly after the shooting Obama essentially uses children to speak out for gun control, exploiting ignorance and using a national tragedy to support his own fucked up gun policies. I find that atrocious on a personal note. 

* Media. This isn't something I've read in the book much (yet). Hitler commonly used propaganda and censorship as most dictators do/did, but Obama doesn't even need to do that. I bet none of you know about the mall shooting that was prevented in Oregon(?) before Sandy Hook by a concealed carrier. Completely disregarded by all news outlets. I don't have to provide countless examples to show that the media is completely biased. 

* (From Anal_Explorer) ""Distracting the public with dumb shit while conducting all of the above"". If I need to give examples here you obviously aren't following politics enough to understand any of this.

"NO.  and here's why:  in the past week/10 days, France, UK and USA have all been all affronted at the use of chemical weapons in Syria, China &amp; Russia (other powerful forces) have been saying MYOB but Obama went outright and said ""WE are going to punish these people for their atrocities"" effectively. Erm, USA hasn't given a shit over the past several months when Syrians have been doing their own thing, killing each other off viciously etc - it's only become a thing because of the chemical weapons. 
So, given how ""exposed"" the US govt has been in the last while, what with whistleblowers etc, then of course the US doesn't want any more possible leaks/proof that they supplied the ""rebels"" in Syria cos that might show an ulterior motive, and we can't have that can we?  Heaven forfend that Snowden's ""leaks"" might point a finger at US/Western supplied chemical weapons to rebels, who might just have deployed them.  Oh the embarrassment of that. (Won't even mention the resources there, but did you notice OP, that oil stocks soared instantly at the mention of potential US input in the middle east?) Just saying - there's money at stake here - not necessarily for you personally, but for the big boys, who play with the stocks/shares and make a fine old living out of speculation as well.  

Enter the Russians &amp; Chinese, all members of the UN, with full VETO rights, and they're saying ""back off"", each  with their own ulterior motives of course (China, mainly cos of investment, Russia does need that strategic seaport link plus whatever other deals they have going on). 
In a nutshell, The US &amp; currently France are pro-strike on Syria, but this  is a much bigger game than one small country, and any strike from western forces has the potential for counter-strikes, culminating in an all-out world war. 

Don't be fooled tho, this one won't be fought at ""the front"" like previous world wars. Technology and transport and shiny clever weapons mean that this could become very very dirty indeed. Chems released over Europe, biological warfare (yes, they all have the knowhow, all of them) and whether you agree or don't, this thing, if it flares, will be way beyond the control of any common/garden human, regardless of nationality ",1

"Because I don't think if we put a Republican in the office, we'd be better off.

Right now, we have a Democrat in the office, pushing the Democrat agenda more or less, taking care of the Democrat constituents and supporters.

To push the Republican agenda and take care of their constituents and supporters while the Democrats attempt to block as much of it as they can.

The thing that grieves me the most is I feel both parties are quite often willing to sacrifice what's good for the PEOPLE if they think it'll get them in office.  While most of my young life I identified with Republicans, the rabid right have driven me away from them.

I was a big fan of Obama when he got elected.  I don't think he handled the bailouts as well as he could have, but then again, that was cleaning up someone else's huge mess dropped in his lap.

"I call it universal healthcare. 

People are idiotic. Our healthcare system is disgusting and benefits exactly no one but insurance companies – I'm actually now part of the 1%, but I spent a good part of my childhood and high school not on health care because [long sob story about awful eleven-year custody battle that severely drained my mother financially]. 

Because of the stress from litigation, she developed cancer and then got leukemia. We weren't able to afford healthcare before, and she certainly couldn't buy the cancer medication alone (though I didn't know it at the time, she used what little money she had on things like braces and food for me). 

She's very smart and worked hard, then made a bunch of money as some kind of business consultant. So she's rich and can finally afford health care...

Oh, but wait! She has a pre-existing condition. She can't get on *any* health care plans, and as she owns her own business, can't get employer care (don't know how that works, but I think PEC people can use it). So she still has to pay out-of-pocket for this medication...

But as she couldn't afford it when her leukemia was in its first/second as opposed to final stage, she will now die. In a few years. There's no surgery that will help her. Medication before would have at least prolonged her life or ... or, you know, removed the thyroid cancer tumor before metastasizing (not the word) into leukemia due to a botched radiation treatment (one of the only things she got out of sheer desperation to get better – couldn't afford any follow-up treatment). 

The health care system doesn't help the poor.

It doesn't really help the rich, either – I found out that the insurance I'm on won't pay for any medication I have (taking depression medication right now for severe chemical issues). The reason rich people benefit from health care is *because they can afford private practice.*

TL;DR: **What people are angry about is that socialized health care may mean a quality decline from doctors. But the only people who can generally afford these doctors are rich. It's kind of like saying ""I don't want anybody else to have free police protection so that they can all protect only me and spend a lot of time dealing with my issues.**

As for Syria, the fact is that Obama drew a line. Syria crossed that line. If we don't respond militarily, it will be an international embarrassment for the US.

Their mantra when it comes to healthcare is ""you should take responsibility for your own healthcare and make enough money to support yourself, instead of forcing me to pay for your shortcomings through my taxes.""

2. It has become a political campaign tool. Conservatives use a modified version of 1. above to ""rally the troops"" in their favor when it's time to vote. Universal healthcare then becomes ""socialized healthcare,"" which unscrupulous media figures equate to ""socialism,"" which to a huge segment of uneducated Americans is equal to ""communism.""

"&gt; I find it more likely they've socially engineered their way to an outcome (bullied someone who knows the cyphers).

You obviously know more about encryption than me, but I don't think how they cracked it really matters. The fact that somebody out there has the code means it's vulnerable. People leak information, remember?

&gt; And there isn't one in democracy either, apparently.

No, but there's one in America's Constitution and we're following it just fine.

&gt; This is not decryption, it's using coercion.

Either way, the code is broken because all code can be broken. Brute force, cypher, coercion, bribery, whatever. 

&gt; Can an agreement made between the companies and the government be valid if the companies are under duress?

Absolutely. If your signature is on the document and you don't agree to what's written in it you'll be held legally accountable anyway. And there's no proof of government coercion. You continue to accuse the government of doing things that they don't do to prove your point. Yes, if the NSA never disciplined their agents and they were actually listening to everyone's calls and they told Steve Ballmer they'd arrest him if he didn't give them Microsoft's entire customer database, then the government would be overreaching and be dead wrong. But none of that is happening. Just because you think they are because your civics teacher convinced you that America was evil doesn't mean they're doing anything wrong.

&gt; Being infamous is not fame. He has no riches.

How much did the Washington Post pay him? You don't know do you? He was able to afford staying in the airport hotel in Moscow for over a month, so I'd assume he's gotten some money from someone. I could be wrong, but his story is definitely valuable and newspapers pay for exclusive stories, so the opportunity is there. 

&gt; He understands the constitution, or as it was originally written at least, better than most.

Not better than federal judges.

&gt; You put too much faith in your leaders.

It doesn't take much faith to trust the legal opinion of a federal judge. It takes a lot to trust the legal opinion of a programmer. You put too much faith in your heros.

&gt; When the government does something, it isn't illegal, because they make it legal.

That's not how laws work. [Watch this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0)

&gt; They have broken the law. There have been lies to congress. So far as I can see, Snowden hasn't lied.

Clapper lied to Congress and he'll eventually be pushed out. So one person lies and we should scrap the whole program? Snowden lied when he signed a confidentiality agreement saying he wouldn't release classified information. 

&gt; I'd rather we instructed cops to wear recording equipment.

I agree.

&gt; I'd rather we own up to the fact that we have abuses of power, and acted accordingly, by monitoring them too.

We do monitor them. The federal courts and Congress...sigh this is getting repetitive.

Look, you don't like it and a lot of other people don't like it either. But neither you nor Snowden nor anyone else can argue that what they were doing is illegal. Federal judges don't have any loyalty to the executive branch and Congress especially doesn't. You keep trying to group the government into one idea as if we had a king making all of these decisions. We have 3 separate and distinct branches of government with their own agendas and opinions and powers over and against one another. There's even dissident among the branches of government. Southern circuit judges tend to be more conservative than northern and western judges. The Republicans and Democrats hate each other. And agencies compete for information and funding all the time. So everybody's power checks somebody else's power. You may not trust any of them, and that's fine because you're entitled to your opinion. And your opinion could mean something if you lived here. Your assertion that just because you don't know every single executive branch decision means they're not being transparent is absurd. Obama didn't promise to declassify all secret government information, but that's what you're asking him to do. It would be stupid for him to promise such a thing. The program is legal, the 3 branches of government support it, most of the American people support it, and that's good enough for it to keep going. The fact that you and Snowden think it's mean or whatever is irrelevant. Your legal opinion is misinformed and invalid. I agree with you about the bloated war and the lack of real focus on healthcare and other imperfections of American society. But you're trying to argue that something that's legal is illegal, which is like arguing that something is white is black. You may feel free to have your *opinion* about our law, but the fact is that the law stands and I'm glad it does. Most people like you that don't trust the government also have a very basic understanding of the law and how the government works in the first place. They believe in conspiracy theories because so much of the mechanics of governments in general are just abstract concepts to them. But I guess it keeps you entertained to think that George Bush planned 9/11. I think the guy was an idiot, but to suggest that he could or would plan such a thing or that anyone else would follow his orders is plain ignorant and it's weird that you could even imagine such a thing.

Your opinion is wrong legally and since you're not even an American it's also irrelevant. If I was you I'd take comfort in the fact that the big bad American government has no purview over your life.

"Other tourists I meet while traveling either think all Americans are stupid, completely uneducated, uncultured idiots, or they really like Americans.

My friend who works at a 5 star hotel in Thailand said that Arab and Indian guests are the ones they really hate. Followed by Russians. She said the American guests are really nice. It's funny though, this same friend also said how much she hates Americans when we were with a big group of people (I was the only American). She has no idea what she's talking about... The most education she gets is from cheesy Thai dating shows, but it's still trendy to talk bad about Americans.

Still wearing the Obama mask?,1
"&gt;I obviously underestimated these guys.

Now I'm not usually very worried about being too derogatory when speaking about the government, but there is something to be said for Hanlon's razor. Some of them might even *believe* they are serving the ""greater good"" by taking measures like this. Doesn't justify it though, obviously.

The dangers of a monopoly on education should be self-evident. It's quite a powerful tool in the hands of the state. Besides the monopolization of law (in which I include war crimes), this and the monopoly over money are probably the worst parts about governments. Money just might be slightly more important because there are possible alternatives from education like self-study, homeschooling, etc. Monopolizing money doesn't leave you with many other options since money by nature relies on the acceptance of the vast majority of other people. Plus monopolizing money helps fund things like monopoly over education.

In fact, Hans-Hermann Hoppe (who, might I add, has an *awesome* name) has a kind of theory on government control in general. He believes that governments maintain control over a people by controlling 4 main institutions: education, communication, money, and security.

The advancement of society actually makes me kind of hopeful on the first too. The internet and cellphones have utterly destroyed government control over communication, as people can talk to each other with extreme ease now. The internet also lead to the birth of thousands of alternative news sources as well, so the government control of information has been entirely destroyed. And with the internet different means of education and ways to study on your own are increasingly easier to find, making self-study easier. The dollar is getting weaker and weaker and may even collapse someday soon. Even if it doesn't happen soon though, this whole banking crisis and seriously shaken the people's faith in the status quo. And that just leaves security. Unfortunately the anti-war left has disappeared ever since Obama took office, but with the militarization of police and the ways governments handle airport security now has made people question even that. So maybe there's hope for the future. We'll see, I guess.

&gt;Also, I thought America kind of prided itself on being a capitalist country... I'm getting confused again.

The people generally do, I would say, although I don't think most really understand it all too well and see ""room for compromise"". Keynesianism dominates economic ideas, so that's what politicians all base their policies on, but I think most of the American people don't feel that way. The way I see it, the democrats on the left and ""liberals"" are really the Keynesian lovers. Most won't call for outright communism or socialism, but they'll get pretty damn close. On the right with conservative, I think you'll find people who follow the Chicago School of economics more than anything else. So they'll be *kinda* free market, and thankfully tend to be pretty outraged at big government spending, but they'll betray it on several key issues, mainly money and war (which ironically is our biggest expenditure right now). They also tend to be pretty nationalistic, so they will love policies that they see as favoring America over other nations, so they'll want policies that keep ""illegal immigrants"" out and will generally be terrified of other non-european countries, especially China and the Middle East. They're a very mixed bag, and their emphasis on patriotism can make them even more pro-government in many ways. The people they vote for though, the republicans, are definitely Keynesians though. They just might be a little less strong about it.

Anyways, what we are now is certainly *not* capitalist. In my opinion, America lost its title for being anywhere *close* to that by World War 1 and sealed its stance as being anti-capitalist during the Great Depression. Huge corporate bailouts, massive government debt, massive regulation over everything, central banking, subsidies, 4 or 5 wars (I've lost count)... True capitalism only exists in anarchy, but I could still consider some of the more laissez-faire governments as being ""capitalistic"". We're nowhere close to that though. We were once, but certainly not now.

&gt;Unfortunately, I won't have much time to read anything for a while onwards... I got about three lab-reports to write and hand in before easter, as well as two mid-term exams. My first mid-terms ever, infact.... I'm just glad I can bring notes.

"I worked for a company that manufactured, serviced, and installed municipal water pumps. Mostly sewage pumps.

The company was opening a new location in my city and they recruited me from another company that did similar operations.

I was hired by a regional manager. I was told I would be ""The office guy"" mostly, and a part-time wrench in the shop. Not field work. Which was a big thing for me because I was taking care of my elderly, blind grandfather. I was his only local relative. I told the regional manager about this in the interview.

Well, apparently they also told Dean the same thing.

Dean was recruited from another local company. He was in his 40s and 300+lbs and a dedicated, hardcore racist and homophobe.

His ""catchphrase"" when entering a room was to yell, ""Can a n***** get a table dance!?!""... He was white.

One time we went on a field job, and he walked into a municipal water treatment plant's office and announced his presence with his catchphrase.

Later that day I asked him if he thought that was appropriate behavior. He said ""Fuck the n******* if they can't take a joke. Get over it. We might have a black president next year. Ain't no such thing as racism if we can have a n****** president.""

I worked with him from August 2008-February 2009. He reference to Obama as n*****-in-Chief.

He would do this behavior in front of the regional managers. He bullied them, just like he bullied everyone else. He would walk into the regional VP's office and slam the door and scream ""Can a n**** get a table dance.""

I went on a job with him. This shithole company (an huge multinational corp, BTW) had be going on field jobs constantly despite me telling them than I was the sole caregiver to a 93 year old, blind WW2 vet.

Anyway, I went on a job with him, a job for which I recieved no training. And he made me drop down into a 10 foot hole where a sewage pump (dry sump) was installed to check the oil level in it.

I didn't find out until a week later than whenever you go into a hole like that, you are supposed to wear a respirator and a safety harness with a winch because noxious fume tend to collect at the bottom.

The next job I went on with him, he wanted me to hang, by my knees, upside down, in a similar tank, but with an open 500hp turbine pump. With no safety equipment. Because we had just installed it and HE had wired it wrong. He wanted me to rewire it, while I hung upside down, above a giant metal turbine. And he'd hold my ankles so I wouldn't fall in. Otherwise we'd have to get the crane back to the site to do it right.

I said ""no"".

He told me to go wait in the truck. He refused to let me do anything else at that jobsite. A week later I was fired for ""not being a team player.""

"My biggest concern with the Affordable Care Act is the possibility that the government will be able to ""decide"" how much insurance I need.  Currently a pay out of my own pocket for cheap insurance.  I don't get sick very often and maybe see the doc 1-2 times per year maximum.  However, I would hate to have the government come in and tell me ""Well, that affordable policy you have doesn't meet minimum standards.  The cheapest option we have for you is $200 a month.""

Yes, I know that their are myths about ""Obamacare"" and the government deathpanels putting granny down, etc.  However, I think my concern is valid.  A major reworking of the health care system was needed...I just hope it doesn't get abused by the system.

So here you are in debt and incapable of paying your dues. Well to you're advantage the banker (the federal reserve) happens to be your buddy and he's slipping you money to keep paying your debts.

[NY Times Article on the thing says this: Mr. McCain is not the first person to find himself in these circumstances. The last Arizona Republican to be a presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater, faced the issue. He was born in the Arizona territory in 1909, three years before it became a state. But Goldwater did not win, and the view at the time was that since he was born in a continental territory that later became a state, he probably met the standard. It also surfaced in the 1968 candidacy of George Romney, who was born in Mexico, but again was not tested. The former Connecticut politician Lowell P. Weicker Jr., born in Paris, sought a legal analysis when considering the presidency, an aide said, and was assured he was eligible. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. was once viewed as a potential successor to his father, but was seen by some as ineligible since he had been born on Campobello Island in Canada. The 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, whose birthplace is Vermont, was rumored to have actually been born in Canada, prompting some to question his eligibility.](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/us/politics/28mccain.html)

The fact that it was discussed is ridiculous already, but it's a tried-and-true attempt that all parties have made (stretching back to President Arthur, President at the start of the 1880s) regardless of race. To classify it as a racist argument (or even one that Republicans alone use) is ridiculous.",1

"No, I think our federal system is too diverse for a nationwide healthcare plan.  Medicare and Medicaid are financial disasters that consume our budget like wildfire.  I also am not comfortable with the federal government gaining an ever growing data base on every single aspect of my life.  They already have my communications, my purchases, etc. why should I want them to control my healthcare data as well? 

The federal government should provide economic stability through the FED, security through the military, emergency disaster relief, and not much else.  States need to take on more responsibility and if your state sucks you have two choices, vote more or leave.  The more decisions that happen at a more local level leads to greater representation for the citizen by the government.  I cannot influence the federal government in America.  It is a waste of my time.  I can vote and bitch on reddit, but my calls are ignored and my voice is too weak.  I can actively influence city council elections, referendums, state house elections, mayor races, etc. Additionally TOO MUCH is happening on the federal level for a citizen to even try and stay informed.  It is impossible.  Thousand page bills come up and down every day and I am none the wiser.  What did Obama promise? I will read every bill I sign.  How long did that last? three days? It is impossible for the fucking POTUS, how the hell am I, a interested citizen, supposed to do it?  

And that is why that is not a cop out, but rather a reasoned approach to why a federalized healthcare is a terrible idea for America on numerous fronts.

"Obama has embraced his predecessor's policies. Policies that during his 2008 campaign, Obama claimed to oppose. He has increased the level of war when he professed to be a leader who would strive towards peace. After receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for [""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,""](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2009/press.html) just look at the results of his alleged efforts. We still have troops in Iraq, Afghanistan doesn't look good, Obama unilaterally made the decision regarding Libya, and now our Commander-in-Chief's about to enter Syria on the flimsiest of evidence. 

Remember when candidate Obama was staunchly opposed to [warrantless wiretapping?](http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9845595-7.html) I remember.

President Obama rarely makes even an attempt to man up against the Republicans. His opposition isn't at all shy in expressing contempt, disdain &amp; outright antagonism towards him. Meanwhile the president consistently responds in a soft, mushy conciliatory manner unbefitting of that office. Initially, I thought ""cool, rise above their vile antics and extend an olive branch.""

People wanted an end to government doing shady shit. People wanted to have gainful employment. People wanted a president who would actually change things, but that hasn't happened.

True enough there are problems left unresolved from the Bush administration - and there were problems left unresolved from the Clinton administration, etc. True enough congress is also a part of government, and Obama can't run the whole thing.

"That was a quote from S&amp;P, not from me.  I'm not sure why I'm wasting time responding to someone who does immature things like write ""OBAMAPHILE"", but I guess I can toy around with you for awhile.  Remember that when Clinton left office we were actually quickly paying down our debt, but under Bush created huge budget deficits with large tax cuts, 2 stupid wars, and a new prescription drug entitlement/drug company handout, none of which was paid for.  Those, plus lower revenues from the bad economy are the major parts of our deficit.  Obama has been stymied by Republicans over and over on fixing the economy and on cutting the deficit.  Remember that on issues like health care reform it was Republicans who fought against anything that would cut the deficit.  

We are not Greece.  Saying that we need ""harsh reality"" ignores the fact that we still the richest country in the world.  The harsh reality is that Republican policies that promote inequality are what prevent us from having a real recovery and a serious discussion about responsible ways to fix the debt.  People working fixes the debt, while slashing spending right now just puts people out of work (like what we see now in Greece).  We need to be talking about how to get people to work and make sure that work pays, while idiots like you think that somehow slashing and burning the economy is the answer.",2

"Well, someone is a bit biased. It is important to realize that issues aren't one sided like you seem to think. Both sides have valid ideas and not just who has the most to gain. For instance, one reason people might of not voted for Obama is they dislike his ideas on gun control, gay marriage, abortion, ect. Each person has the right to vote for a president based on what they feel is the most pressing issue. Republicans are not trying to screw over the poor as you like to think, they just want to improve the economy, and the best way to do that is by instituting a freer market. However, also keep in mind that this is not all republicans. Each Republican is different, as is each Democrat, we have had liberal Republicans and conservative Republicans just like we have had liberal and conservative Democrats. Keep in mind that republicans are also not generally the rich, but the upper middle class. A lot of the rich are actually democrats, because they have so much money that they don't know what to do with it, why not let the government help out those less fortunate, (I forget where I read this though, so it might not be true, but it at least seems logical). I am confused at what exactly you are mad at? Is there specific issues that you dislike that republicans support? Their ideas are not bad and not evil like you tend to think. While I can't convince you of the republican ideals, I at least want you to realize that it is not so 1 sided. 

All that being said, the Republicans are also not so great. I personally, am a moderate Libertarian, but that is just me. Keep in mind the idea moderate. This is what everyone forgets when it comes to politics, and a big reason why I choose to be a Libertarian. People carry the idea that all Libertarians are rednecks or anarchists. I am neither of these things, just as Republicans are not Fascists and Democrats are not Communists. Each party's ideas are correct to an extent. If Liberatarians were all radicals, then there would mostly be anarchy. If Democrats had their way, there would be a close alternative to the Communism, and if Republicans had their way then there would be almost Fascism. This is assuming each party consisted of only radicals. However, lets look more on a smaller bases and how the economy would turn out:

Democrats like the idea of helping everyone. This generally means more government interference. So, the government will be able to provide the lower class with more money. In addition, the government will also be able to help smaller businesses thrive and not be crushed by bigger corporations. This is great because it would be awesome to have everyone in a place where they can live without having to worry about survival.

Republicans almost always approve of the free market. This is great for the economy. By letting the market run itself it allows the battle of the fittest to take place. Only the companies that are the best will survive. This means that no money will be wasted trying to keep bad businesses afloat or preventing large businesses from getting even bigger and employing more people. This is great because this means that we will live in a country with a whole bunch of profiting businesses. Plus, the richer upper class will make investments in profitable small companies, allowing the small companies to survive and make it to a solid place.

However, there are also downfalls to both sides:

Democrats try to keep the small businesses afloat, which will lose money by sending it to these small businesses. The money will have to come from bigger companies that could instead be using their money to grow bigger and employ more people. Plus, the government is currently spending more money than it has. This means that unless we make budget cuts we will keep going into deeper debt. And since the Democrats do not want to cut many things from the government, they do not stop the spending. The economy would be in a pretty terrible place depending on far the democrats go.

Now the Republicans will be having a lot of money, but as you stated earlier, this money will go almost completely to the rich. They will be the CEOs of the most profitable companies in the world but these companies would also treat their employes like crap. The poor would get not help from the government and would live on minimal conditions, however the middle class and rich would be living pretty great. The Republicans would view this as okay because as they see it, the ones who worked the hardest and ended up successful deserve the money.

When it comes to social issues those are a little bit harder to discus. Just keep in mind that you don't need to stick to your own party. If you think killing babies is wrong but are a Democrat, it is okay. Just like if you think it is homophobic to be against gay marriage but are a Republican. Both of these are okay, you don't need to agree with everything your party supports.

To wrap this up, I want to tell you the basic truth, there is no right party. It would be great to give the money to the people who are poorer and could really use it, but it would also be great to give the money to the people to those who worked hard studied hard, and came up with those idea to get the money. There is no correct choice for this. Both parties are right, **in moderation**. So, next time be careful when insulting a party. Especially when you are insulting the whole party and not just one idea that they have.

TL;DR: It is all about moderation, no political party is right, learn about each party, make an educated decision on which one feels best to you, don't be afraid to have different ideas, and respect others of different parties.

"I'm an American who lived in Toronto for the last seven years. When I came it was during the hey days of George Bush as president, and Canadians liked to tease me about how reasonable their country was and how crazy the US was. That lessened a lot over time, and in general I think Canadian politics is messed up (not to say that US politics isn't, just in different ways).

More than you might expect, Canadian politics is driven by cults of personality. For all that seats in parliament are divided up into ridings (districts for Americans), people pretty much just vote for the party that they like based on who the party leader is. This manifests in all sorts of ways that I find really bizarre:

- Elizabeth May, who is the leader of the Green Party, ran for seats in three different ridings in three different provinces in a five year period. She was clearly just hopping around from riding to riding until she found one that would elect her.

- Michael Ignatieff lived in the UK from 1987-2000 and the US from 2000-2005. At around that time people started talking about him as the savior of the Liberal party, and he apparently bought into the hype, resigned from his job at Harvard, took up residence in suburban Toronto, and was elected to Parliament. He then lost the leadership race to Stephane Dion, who would quickly become known as one of the most ineffectual leaders. However, Dion's missteps would soon be overshadowed by Ignatieff's own, as he won the leadership race and then presided over one of the most disastrous elections for the Liberal party in Canadian history. But who could have foreseen that somebody who had spent his entire life in academics in other countries would be an ineffectual political leader? Right.

- Then there's Jack Layton and the NDP. I should be clear, that my own political sympathies are probably closest to the NDP, and I think the closest a current US politician would come to them might be Elizabeth Warren. But there's a lot to criticize here too. The appeal of the NDP was essentially as a cult of personality for Jack Layton, and they made steady gains under his stewardship. Unlike Ignatieff, Layton was a serious and experienced politician who also seems to have been a genuinely likeable guy. But given the timing of his death, it seems pretty clear that he was aware during the election that it would be an issue, and it seems clear that people voted for NDP candidates in their ridings because they liked Jack Layton. There are numerous stories of new MPs in the 2011 election who were woefully underqualified for the posts that they were elected to, with some of them admitting that they had signed up as space fillers in ridings that they fully expected to be carried by the Bloc Quebecois. But the biggest thing that baffled me about Jack Layton and the NDP was that both he and his wife were MPs for different ridings. What? Don't husbands and wives normally share a residence? I could kind of understand it if they had gotten married while they were both MPs, but they married in 1988 and he became an MP in 2004 and she did in 2006. It seems ridiculous to me, and yet I never head anyone who was Canadian comment on it.

- This leads us to the current, hilarious state of Canadian politics. The official opposition leader is Thomas Mulcair of the NDP, a man who I suspect very few Canadians outside of NDP circles knew, and who since taking over has had multiple MPs defect to other parties. Meanwhile, the Liberal party underwent a period of soul searching about how to deal with the ridiculous and entirely foreseeable in hindsight consequences of choosing someone so poorly suited to active political life as Michael Ignatieff, and then they picked a new leader who was even more ridiculous:

- Justin Trudeau. Honestly, I'm completely baffled by the love that Justin Trudeau gets. As far as I can tell, he has three accomplishments. 1) His father was the most influential Canadian politician of the 20th century. I mean, we don't even have an American comparison to make; Pierre Trudeau was prime minister for fifteen years. 2) Justin gave a very moving eulogy at his father's funeral. 3) Justin looks much younger than he actually is. He's 41, but looks like he's 26. Seriously, that's it as far as qualifications go. He was a serial grad school dropout who appeared to have no clear direction in life. Then people started talking about how he would be the savior of the Liberal party before he had ever run for elective office, and within five years he went from doing a master's in environmental geography to being the leader of the Liberal party. People like to compare him to Obama, which I find really weird. Trudeau was one of the most privileged people in Canada, and up to the point he entered politics he had accomplished very little outside of the strictly personal. Obama grew up with no privilege and accomplished a great deal, having achieved his law degree and taught for twelve years at the University of Chicago and served in elected office for eleven years before he became president. Any comparison between the two begins and ends with the fact that their speeches excited young people.

- In all this, I haven't said anything about the Conservatives, for good reason. Stephen Harper is possibly the most unlikeable politician ever, but he's ruthless and skilled and I suspect he is enjoying the current disarray amongst the Canadian-left. The only cult of personality that he enjoys is that his side is now used to winning. Just look at this [picture](http://thingsharperdoestoseemhuman.tumblr.com/post/36556930581/meeting-with-local-vanilla-ice-impersonators) of him with Justin Bieber. It's a toss-up which one I want to punch more.

So, I've been ragging on Canada a lot, and they do some things pretty well. Namely, their elections are much faster and cost less money, and the turnover in MPs is more significant than in the US, where it is almost impossible to force out incumbents no matter what their job performance is like. But the downside is that it appears to create a system in which woefully underprepared people who have little connection to local communities are tossed into the deep end with relatively little preparation. They have to sink-or-swim, and most of them end up sinking. I suspect that the next time they have an election, the NDP will end up losing a number of their seats and the Liberals will gain back a few of the seats they lost in the last election, but the Conservatives will still triumph. And the Liberals will scratch their heads about why they didn't do better with a candidate whose approach to policy making is [to refuse to give any policy details](http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/08/28/justin-trudeau-says-policy-specifics-will-have-to-wait-as-liberals-begin-meaningful-consultation-on-platform/) until after elections.",2

why not Romney? I mean yeah he said some stupid things in the campaign but a lot of that was trying to appeal to Republicans on further sides of the spectrum. I don't really like him as a guy but I still think he would have done a better job that Obama or at least have gotten more stuff done,-1
"Great post sir! We millennials are somewhat indoctrinated to believe the governments role is to create social justice. However, a nation (along with its economy) is far too complicated for a group of politicians to plan.  

History shows that attempting to plan an economy necessarily makes it less efficient.  Now, the American system is not perfect, far from it. BUT it is the framework within which a human can be most free. I can do and say what I like, spend my money how I please, and live the way I choose as long as I don't violate someone else's liberty. There is a reason the government of the US is the oldest and most prosperous in the world. (Also note that our decline coincides with vast expansions of government)

What the younger generation fails to realize is that the very initiatives undertaken in the name of 'social justice' are unjust, because they favor certain groups. Once a government starts handing out favors to special groups (subsidies for certain farmers/businesses, exemptions from Obamacare, etc), then social justice evaporates. No matter how cold it seems, the constitution deems we treat EVERYONE the same, which means letting everyone make their own decisions and live with the consequences. (Not to say we can't offer limited assistance as a last resort for the citizenry)",2

"All girls school here.

Likes:

- Just being able to slap on a uniform and brush your hair.  No one was disgusting, but it was definitely very relaxed and not a lot of stress/time getting ready in the morning.

- Our sports teams were the only sports teams and didn't have to compete for attention with traditionally popular boys' sports.  They were consequently taken seriously.

- Being all girls meant people had to at least try to be amicable with other girls or you'd have zero friends.  Sure, there was some gossip and teasing and so forth - it is high school - but it was a lot less catty than when folks were vying for male attention.  Being able to *goof-off.*

- Girls being generally active class discussions.  Being less reluctant, myself, to participate.  Being a known as 'smart' or 'opinionated' was not seen as a social handicap since everyone was expected to offer volunteer thoughts.  I also thought social stratification was a lot less of an issue, but that could likely be attributed to a number of factors including same-sex (ex. uniforms.)

- Having to acquire the skill of meeting boys outside of my school pool and learning to ask boys out.

Dislikes:

- Dealing with the usual critiques by people who never attended, looking at me like I just said I was a felon when I said I attended an all girls school.  ""Oh, so you're all lesbians and/or bitches?""  Also; ""I could never go to an all girls/boys school.  I would die.""  Do people in opposite-sex schools just have so much sex during the school day that they would genuinely suffer for lack of interaction all of 7 hours?

- Having class with boys in college was an adjustment.  I never considered myself at all boy-shy, but I was definitely more accustomed to seeing them during particular times of the day, not throughout.

- Periods syncing and resyncing every break and every year.  Thanks, Obama.

Edit:

- I think I might be ""weird"" in some ways.  For example, I tend to be pretty animated and like to joke around; I'm simply comfortable doing that and it's a part of my personality that was primarily fostered in high school. I might be reading this wrong, but I've noticed most women conform to a certain notion to who they think they should be (ex. quiet, passive), and I think *that* is also fostered around the same time.  I personally prefer my way, but some might list it as a negative.  It was more of an anomaly when I first left high school and less so now as most parties have gotten older, but it's still there.  Nothin' wrong with being quiet, of course, but that's my observation.

Most of the cons at my school were administrative and not related to the same-sex status, honestly.  It's a pretty good deal, imo.",10
Cynical thoughts ahead... Obama and the entire gov is obviously a puppet institution that's a totally owned subsidiary of multi national corps.   We blame the gov because the real power wants us too.  I don't understand why this issue has gained so much traction anyway.  I'm not ok with what the NSA is doing but it isn't nearly as sinister as using drones to kill American citizens without a trial.  The Internet and the bandwagons it creates.. Lol.  ,1

"Thank you so much. Her's was stage 3 when they caught it. The doc said she prolly wouldn't make it 6 months and she actually made it. She said that she wasn't going to go a day before 6 months just to prove the doctor wrong (the doc who diagnosed her was kind of a dick with no bedside manner). It was hell for her and I'm proud of how hard she fought, but no one deserves to suffer that much.

I know what your saying about pancreatic cancer being a special kind of fucked up. Were you or your dad genetically tested? My mom's oncologist did genetic testing on her and she carried the gene for GI tract cancer (as well as other women in her family). The doc said that my sister and I should get tested as well (my brothers too, but she was more concerned with me and my sister since it seems to follow the women in the family). Genetic testing costs about $100 and the US passes a law later in 2008 that insurance companies can't raise premiums based off of genetic testings. I know that with ""Obamacare"" your insurance shouldn't be affected if you get tested (if you're an American).",2

I see your point about offering condolences, but he's the President--given his position, he should remain neutral until the court declares Zimmerman innocent/guilty. If Zimmerman's story is true, then it was just the work of a moment that made Zimmerman the killer and Martin the victim. Zimmerman's going to have a tough life after the trail whether he is convicted or not. There's empathy to be had for both sides, but Obama only mentioned one.",-3

"Mitt Romney would have attacked Syria, and tried to step up presence in the Middle East rather than the pivot to Asia strategy that Obama has implemented. Other than that, I'm not sure that he would have handled the NSA scandal well, or any scandal really. As the general left wing media I bet would have been a bit harsher on him then Obama. He definitely would have fallen to the whims of the far right and probably would have drove the country past the debt limit last January. Generally we would not have been better off. Last elections presidential crop did have some good candidates on the ballot that I believe would have done a better job than Obama so far, but they were all third party or independent candidates running in a commercialized election.",2

American here..  All these people advocating govt healthcare.  You are the same people that are astounded (no.. pissed off) about the NSA spying scandals.  Yet you want that same govt supplying your healthcare.  What is more powerful than controlling your health???  Do you think that same govt that is taking away your privacy and freedom of speech won't use the healthcare power against you?  Don't you get it people???  It is about FREEDOM from the govt... NOT about denying people healthcare.  The US has many programs for the poor and indigent to receive healthcare for free or near free.  The US didn't need Obamacare.  Obamacare is about taking control... not about giving healthcare.  Sad that so many people don't see that and decided to give away their freedom to avoid paying for healthcare.,-17

10-07-2013  A prophecy, passed on to prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen: This counts for all countries... See what’s coming now! I, Thunder, the messenger angel of God, will visit every country!
Please share and do not change © BC












Full view:

Hello, welcome! On July 10th, 2013, the angel of the Lord brought on this prophetic message of God to Benjamin Cousijnsen.

Shalom, prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen! I greet you in the almighty Name above all names, which is very great and mighty and powerful. In His name, I come, in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ! Verily, verily, I tell you, my name is Thunder.



Hear attentively!

Read aloud: Genesis 3, verse 8 to 11  Here it is written: They heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. And the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?” The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.” God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
The messenger angel of God spoke further,

Verily, China, Korea, Spain, Mexico, America, Iraq, Africa, Indonesia, Belgium, Germany, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Netherlands!
Prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen warned you since 2012. Verily, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob sent me, Thunder. Also, Syria and Turkey were warned, because of disobedience and dragon worship and idolatry! I, Thunder, had to cause also lot of damage to Tokyo, and many perished.

And God opened the floodgates, and there never fell yet as much water as in 2013!
Benjamin told you yet: One will remember 2013 well!
I, Thunder, brought you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, many warnings. See also, what I brought to many countries now. But okay, your choice is your choice! But God's choice is clearer and stands firm! He says to you, He who does not want to hear, will perish.

This counts for all countries!
Make no mess of your country. I, Thunder, will visit each country.
In hell is fire, and the earth is already a mirror of hell.

Exodus 11, verse 6  There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.

Verily, read aloud: Exodus 22, verse 20  Here it is written: He who sacrifices to any god, except to the LORD only, shall be utterly destroyed.
The messenger angel of God spoke further,

The Lord warned all countries through prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen! 
Read aloud: Exodus 23, verse 20 to 21, and verse 24 to 26
Exodus 23, verse 20 to 21  Here it is written: Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Pay attention to him, and listen to his voice. Don’t provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience, for my name is in him.
And verse 24 to 26  You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly overthrow them and demolish their pillars. You shall serve the LORD your God, and he will bless your bread and your water, and I will take sickness away from your midst. No one will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of your days.
The messenger angel of God spoke further,

Verily, this is a promise to you, and still you do not listen.
Benjamin Cousijnsen says this: ""I am the voice of one, crying: Make straight your paths, destroy every idol and repent! Have remorse! Return to the holy Scriptures of God and obey His commandments.""
Verily, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ, Isa, says to you today:

John 3, verse 16 and 17  Read this aloud. Here it is written: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. 
The messenger angel of God spoke further,

Yet briefly... if you do not listen, the world and your country will be leveled, and God will say: satan is under My foot!
See, what’s coming now! 



Read aloud: Sirach 10, verse 12 to 17  There it is written: Pride has its beginning when a person abandons the Lord, his maker. Pride is like a fountain pouring out sin, and whoever persists in it will be full of wickedness. That is why the Lord brought terrible punishments on some people and completely destroyed them. The Lord has overthrown kings and put humbler people in their place. The Lord has pulled up nations by the roots and established humbler ones in their place. The Lord has overthrown empires and completely devastated their lands. He destroyed some so completely that they are not even remembered any more.
The messenger angel of God spoke further,

Verily, Benjamin, I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! spoke the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.

SHALOM!

"Putin is the correct answer. In theory Obama commands more military,  diplomatic, and economic might... But he faces more opposition from within. The same argument could be made for Hu Jintoa. He has to balance his reformist/expansionist agenda with hard liners of the old party. 

The pope is another common choice. But while the Pope has general ideological influence it's not real power. I mean just ask any Irish-Boston Catholic liberal how much they listen to the Vatican when it comes to their view on family planning. And that's just one example. Putin has a little opposition in his country. But they don't have any power to stop his agenda. He has done opposition abroad.  No one willing to go force on force with him. Plus every winter his pipeline keeps  in the palm of his hand. 

Putin far from runs the world. But of any one single person he wields the most power.",2

As for racism; bear in mind that at this point, Obama has been president for 5 years and yet close to half of republican voters believe he is not a legitimate American citizen. 

also, is it really impossible to imagine a government that *does* provide healthcare and yet *does not* listen to our phone calls? The two aren't necessarily linked.",75
Correct me if I'm wrong since I don't have a deep understanding about all this. But isn't Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act suppose to help us deal with these bad practices of the insurance companies? ,1

George Washington  really paused too long between words and spoke too softly in my opinion.  Grant slurred his words a lotand always was asked to repeat things!",2
"Actually it is a type of Universal Healthcare because it mandates healthcare and it provides up to 100% subsidies for people's who income qualifies them.

Universal healthcare just means a system that allows healthcare for all. Obamacare does that by knocking out pre-existing conditions, using a legal mandates and subsidizing those who can't afford the plans. 

It equates to everyone gets healthcare unless them opt out. That is the definition of Universal Healthcare.

I think maybe you're confusing the term Universal healthcare with the idea of Single Payer healthcare where the government rolls the cost of Universal healthcare up into something like federal taxes. 

I see no reason to not consider Obamacare Universal healthcare. I does in fact provide 100% health care subsidies to those who can't afford healthcare. If you lose your job and have no income you can get free healthcare under this plan. You can't be denied.

The fact that you can pick a plan or that you pay for the plan directly does not mean it's not Universal Health care. 

The US system uses a compulsory insurance model of Universal Healthcare.

It's right here in the wikipeadia Universal Healthcare definition.

How you fund the healthcare is not what determines if it's a Universal healthcare plan. That is determined by ""who is covered, what services are covered, and how much of the cost is covered""

Obamcare did not increase taxes on the masses to pay for the plan, so the fact you still pay for insurance is offset by the fact we didn't raise taxes to pay for it. It's like a compulsory employer funded Universal Healthcare system with the government covering the backend for the low income brackets. 

The end result is that nobody has an excuse to not have healthcare other than you're an asshole who refuses to pay the 40-50 bucks a month for a basic plan, you're too lazy to signup or you are Wolverine and you don't need healthcare. Everyone else gets covered and cannot be denied. 

That, by definition, is Universal healthcare. How you fund it does not matter. You could have 100% private Universal healthcare for that matter. If private insurance was truly self regulating in a fair way and would offer low to zero cost premiums to low income brackets we'd effectively have fully privatized Universal Healthcare. 

Really all it means is that everyone has access to affordable healthcare. Once the website issues are resolved more people will realize they are covered and have low cost options they never had before and access to subsidies if you make something like less than 30k a year.

"&gt; The government can't afford a lot of things, but that doesn't stop us from buying them.

Doesn't even come close to justifying the action, no matter how repeatedly our government does this. 

&gt; The Republicans don't want it to happen, so it's not happening.

Again this is where you're wrong, they're asking to defund it for a year. The republicans are fully aware, and prepared for Obamacare to be implemented. Yes they don't want it, but that doesn't mean it's not happening. Governors have already decided which mandates they're paying fines on to avoid, the obamacare website is already underway for sign-ups (with some technical difficulties), and many other measures have already went underway in preparation. Obamacare is happening, no ands, ifs, or buts about it.

The GOP is simply asking for a better solution than to implement right now when the country can't afford it, and it seems that Republicans have other solutions on the table since the House passes multiple bills daily with alternative solutions that simply are washed away by the Senate and the executive branch. Obama saying initially there wasn't going to be any compromise with Republicans has not helped the situation at all. What also doesn't help is now some of the media (looking at you Wolf Blitzer) have questioned the President's actions as well, and aren't as much on the blame republicans train as they initially were themselves. John Boner also hasn't handled the situation well himself but after all... he is john boner. Only to be expected. 

it's a whole mess right now, party affiliation aside I'm ashamed of our whole government, and even more pissed off everyone responsible for the shutdown is getting paid while the shutdown is in effect. I have zero faith our government will find an efficient solution, and I have no choice but to vote these assholes in and out every 2 years. ",0
"""the world's attempt""

Then the U.N. should handle it. I'm not saying this atrocity doesn't deserve action, just that when so far the U.N. is yet to react, our closest ally the U.K. has voted no at the very least until the U.N. weapons inspectors release findings.

So that leaves us pretty much in the same place we were pre-Iraq. That being in a position to start yet another major military operation on data that has been either rejected by allies, or refuted by other U.N. members and former WWII enemies. The latter of which have dispatched war ships.

Obama would have to go straight up John Wayne to be able to pull this off.

We shall see how his war campaign goes over with Congress.",1

They thought he was going to be the anti-politician, even though he displayed that he was a very good one during his campaign.

"As to why it's a failure, I don't know. But to why so many of us hate it, well this is my opinion:

So picture this. We are in debt so deep you can't even see, right? On top of that debt, he wants to **spend more money** on healthcare. Now, I am good with the government helping out people with healthcare, foodstamps, and WIC. It's really nice of them. However, I know from experience working as a cashier in a grocery store that about half the people the government supports with EBTs are just lazy piles of festering sugar. I understand that for some people it is needed and is a necessary evil. I have even had customers who were embarrassed about it. I also know that there are a lot of people who use it as a way to not have to work. They are on ""disability"" so they don't have to work mainly because they're lazy. And you know what those kinds of people buy? JUNK FOOD. Only junk food. Honest. To. God. And it pisses me off.

No, that's not how it works, too often legislation suffers from the law of unintended consequences. 


1) I think partial birth and later-stage abortion is abhorrent, I'm not talking about denying people condoms but that late in pregnancy and there's more ethical issues than you can shake a stick at once you move into late-term pregnancy.


2) I don't support hate speech laws, call me a ""faggot"" from noon till night if you want, if you feel inclined to then you probably need more help than I ever would. It keeps the crazies like the Westboro Baptists from playing the victim card. 


3) Being opposed to nuclear power, this one I wil never understand. We could replace all of our fossil fuels and try to reduce carbon emissions, the only price to pay would be Yucca Mountain as opposed to, the rest of the environment. Simply because it has ""nuclear"" in the name it's scares all the hippies to death. Or even better, thorium salt anyone?


4) The fetishization of reducing inequality. I'm not saying inequality is a good thing, but in every society it's inevitable to some extent, it tends to be a symptom of the problem. Look at North Korea, the GINI coefficient doesn't tell the whole story, a high per-captia income needs to compliment it. Also, gee, remember Obama throwing $800 billion at our 12 elite banks worth a combined $20 trillion so we could save them from the $80 billion in toxic assets from AIG? (I'm sure there were more that I'm not aware of, nevertheless) I do, and then these same people complain about fatcat bonuses. 


5) I like guns too. There are far better correlations between education/income/poverty in a country and homicide than there are with gun ownership per captia. 


6) As someone else mentioned too, everything you do if you're a conservative makes you racist. I don't give a damn what color your skin is or where you're from, if you have solutions let's hear them.

"The money comes from taxes, which if you ask most people, the already pay enough of, except, you know that other guy.  He doesn't pay his fair share.

But aside from that, the government already covers many people, as mentioned in other comments, and they do that by not paying doctors for what they provide.  Additionally, by having the government in control of such a large chunk of patients payments, the government can dictate regulations and ridiculous billing requirements or withhold payment.  This creates added expenses for healthcare providers, since they now need billing specialists and EMR software and tech support and many other compliance expenses.  Add to this that the government actively seeks to find minor errors in billing so they can withhold payment, not because the service was not provided or was even unnecessary, but because the billing was done incorrectly.  They go so far as to hire firms who specialize in finding billing errors and pay them 10% of everything they ""save"" the government.  

Now let's add into this mix that once the government controls your healthcare, they can then control every aspect of your life or withhold that healthcare.  You smoke? No healthcare for you! Overweight? Enjoy trans fats? Drink alcohol? No healthcare for you either! Now, I'm not saying these things are good for people, but they should have the right to do as they wish with their bodies without the government being able to socially engineer behavior under the threat of withholding care.

So let's recap: healthcare providers get screwed out of the free market compensations that everyone else in the country gets to enjoy when they put their services on the market.  They have to put up with ridiculous government regulations, like HCAAPS which measures patient satisfaction as a metric of determining reimbursements which has nothing to do with the quality of care and everything to do with the perception of the patient, you lose the freedom to live how you want without the specter of being left out in the cold if you don't comply and the money still has to come from somewhere.

Oh, and let's not forget the American all you can eat mentality.  When something is provided for free, people will consume.  Not because they need it, but because it is there. There is a limited number of doctors and medical resources out there and if everyone starts using them the same way they fill their plates at Hometown Buffet, we will run out very fast.  People need to feel some of the financial cost of their care or they will have no respect for it and will consume it without any concern for who is next in line.

I could go on, but I think this is a good start for why people with knowledge of economics and healthcare are opposed to Obamacare, socialized medicine, single payer or whatever else you want to throw out there.  The vast majority of practicing physicians I know are disgusted with it but they have no choice because the government controls the insurance of tens of millions of people and if you close your doors to them for even a week in protest, you will go out of business because the margins are so low and the overhead is so high.  Board certification alone costs something like $10000 every time you have to renew.",-16

AIG was a different story, they struck some kind of bizarro retention deal with upper management in summer of 2008 that made the bonuses mandatory and nobody caught it in their diligence in the days leading up to the bailout, or they would have contracted around it.

"Its the same reason as people deny the holocaust or are convinced that Obama is a socialist,atheist, muslim or not born in America/believe man-made global warming is made up/that the Twin Towers was blown up by the CIA/that homeopathy works/ that homosexuality is sin for some reason and fucking Evolutionary theory.

Essentially, despite the *vast* deluge of information regarding the evidence of said items proven reality or proven fiction there will ALWAYS be detractors. Why they are detractors vary from person to person - e.g. someone might have been convinced by a father figure or a seen a particularly thriling documentary. Some may have anecdotal stories of something (e.g. seen a relative ""cured"" of their chronic pain by a homeopathic remedy). Some may have been raised to not believe it or distrust it because it affected them personally - e.g. someone who's job depends on global warming not happening.

But the reason why the myth proliferates and becomes less of an obvious sham is a simple psychology trick - the human condition is that we are raised to question our own understanding of something patently true if enough people around us express doubts. Thus it sows the seed - and the seed always sprouts in some fashion or the other.

A good example would be the global warming ""debate"". Now, any scientist worth his salt is fully prepared and able to acknowledge that Global Warming is real, is man made and that it will have severe consequences. What we are disagreeing on is how we can tackle it. 

But a detractor can and will ignore the mountains of evidence in its favour to point out minor inconsistencies of data - such minor inconsistencies that would not be sufficient, scientifically speaking, to sink a tested theory - but enough to raise doubts in person A's head about the veracity of the information. Now that minor inconsistency could be applied to all the evidence - perhaps there's a conspiracy to hide the rest of it. Perhaps the whole of it is just a fraud cooked up - lets construct a scenario where the fraud needs to prevail to aid a group - who would that be? Western governments. Why? To stop 3rd world and developing nations from utilising their vast coal power resources and preventing Western exploitation! Of course! It makes perfect sense! Suddenly it all ties together.

You can use that for almost anything - Holocaust denial - some records are missing; therefore all records are false. The holocaust was a jewish conspiracy to enable them to create a Hebrew free state and exploit middle eastern instability for profit! of course! 

and so on.

**TL;DR: Minor inconsistencies or missing evidence are enough for those who's minds are already made up about something to cast a doubt/shadow over every other bit of evidence. They then form a nucleus of doubt where multiple people then buy into it, and it spreads.**

Obama 2016,1
"In all honesty, it doesn't hold much water for me.  This particular article states that the law doesn't apply to Americans, but a natural skeptic would disregard this stipulation anyway.  Obama has extended or approved other legislation that is worse, however; it seems to me that in the absence of significant public outcry or his party leaders telling him not to do so, he will keep the status quo going.

This wiretapping law fits into one of his strategies for the military sector, which is to let them do whatever they want unless he really finds a reason not to.  I don't agree with this and wish he had more of a spine in these matters.  

Some things don't even seem to pique his interest, such as internet censorship, Hollywood bullying over piracy, and monopolies in certain industries (agriculture with Monsanto, telecom with current cell phone providers).  There's so little if any documentation on what he thinks of these things, much less what he's willing to do about them...

But still, when I try to gather as much dirt on him as I can, it just doesn't compare to Bush.  Inadvertent (or willful?) ignorance is just so dangerous, and he had it in very large supply - Obama at least gives me this feeling that he somewhat knows what he's doing, in comparison, even if I don't like everything he does.",-2

I started working in politics at 26 with more student loans than you. When your pay is really shitty, you can get your federal student loan payments lowered. That's what I had to do.

If you had sought out a field organizer position with the Obama campaign (as a democrat, I don't know what republicans paid), you could have had a $32k/ year job with housing provided.  

If you're looking to make good money at the entry-level, politics is not going to cut it. Unfortunately, there's a very high demand for political positions, and a lot of people are willing to work for peanuts to do it. It's a supply/demand issue. The higher level positions with more pay tend to go to people with organizing experience over anyone else.

From what I understand, down there, health care is mostly private industry, from insurance to hospital to the medical staff themselves. And being private, money is what matters most.

He is desperate and seeking anything to make him look like a success.  He views helping the people of syria it.  Syria's president Assad is a moderate muslim.  Get rid of him and they are likely to see an asshole like Iran has.  Hardcore muslim that wants to make the people suffer.  I think Assad is getting blamed for shit that he hasn't done.  It could be from his generals or intelligence trying to blame him.

That is simply factually incorrect. We have laws in this country. Every hospital in the country is required to treat your illness or trauma regardless of your ability to pay.

Remember, as Zippy the Pinhead said, the US has the cultural memory of a wombat. That goes for political memory as well.

"&gt; Obama also threatened to veto the NDAA and we all know how that turned out. 

Yes: he upheld his veto threat. Which is why we should be confident here. No, seriously.

Obama threatened to veto the NDAA unless his concerns were met. The bill was amended; his concerns were met. He signed it into law. However, his concerns were not ours there--Americans were concerned about indefinite detention, and Obama was worried the bill took _away_ some executive powers. 

In contrast, this time Obama's concerns are our concerns--privacy. 

Since so many have forgotten that Obama got exactly what he wanted out of the NDAA, here is [Jon Stewart](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-december-7-2011/arrested-development---one-way-train-to-gitmo) on the topic. 

&gt; &gt; White House Press Secretary Jay Carney: Any bill that challenges or constrains the President's critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect the nation would prompt his senior advisers to recommend a veto.

&gt; Stewart: You got that? Obama is going to veto this thing not because he objects to the execute branch having _near_-infinite power to detain whomever it wants, but because he objects to the executive not having _totally_-infinite power. Apparently there is a provision in the bill that says the President must detain foreign terror suspects in _only_ military custody, unless he has a waiver. He's gotta issue a waiver. The White House is going to veto this because they don't want to do any paperwork. 

Or take the testimony from the [floor of the US Senate](http://www.blacklistednews.com/Why_Obama_Will_Not_Veto_NDAA_Military_Detention_of_Americans%3A_He_Requested_It./16945/0/38/38/Y/M.html) if you prefer. 

&gt;  it was Obama who requested the provision for indefinite military detention of American citizens without charge or trial.

"Listen to NPR's ""On The Media"" for the long answer... it seems like every week they have some nuance to add. But being unbiased is easy to argue for, hard to do... because being unbiased is kind of a mythic thing. What exactly is being unbiased? Giving equal time to both sides? Meeting in the middle and covering that? That sounds great, except it presumes that neither side is any more correct than the other, which still may sound great... but consider media covering say, a genocide... is unbiased reporting saying that the victims really object to being killed, but giving equal time to the killers' argument that the victims are inferior and deserve what they're getting? Would unbiased reporting have to spend 50% of its time talking about the junk science that the victim race is inferior, because it would be biased to just dismiss all of that as scientifically invalid?

To use a less extreme example, Obama's birth certificate... you had one side that was factually accurate - that there was a mountain of evidence that Obama was born in Hawaii, and no coherent argument that he wasn't... was it unbiased reporting to give equal time to both sides and not make any sound more likely than the other?

"""I've dreamed of you for the last few weeks.""

Shit I got an email that is chock full of inappropriate. If anyone is interested I'll censor the name parts and post it.

**EDIT**: Now I need to give some set up before I post the email. This teacher is male, about 50, and married. I was/am 18 (when he first met me) and now 19. I'm a solid 7/10 (shaky 8 on a good tit day) I'd say. This teacher, Mr. Z held a historical board game club after school and I attended the club all through my senior year and for about 5 months after graduation before I dropped contact with him. I normally just kinda lose contact with high school people as I transitioned to college. 

The mention of John is that he invited me to a club outside school and I drove to his house and then we went together to his place for a game. The mention of my grandma was that my granny though it was fishy this guy saw me outside of school without his wife. And that the teacher actually got close with another girl out of school and she had to move north, away from him.

Note, I actually was at his house once and met his wife. This was before he told me he dreamed of me and after he told his wife. Now I know why she looked so guarded around me and I feel like an ass.

So after a while he sends me this email. The only things edited are my college name and people names:

*Hey SpectreAnitaShepard – haven’t heard from you in several weeks, hoping it’s either a cell phone prob or you are just that busy, which I’ll confess I find hard to believe – I also don’t want to believe that you’re so lame that you can’t take 15 seconds to respond to a text. ; )  Hope you didn’t end up in too much trouble for breaking stuff @ your house on Memorial Day, whatever it was.

   We’ve been having a lot of fun the last few times the various gangs have gotten together, hope you will join us soon. We had a great game of “Perikles” here Tues. night.  Long as I’m writing though, figured I’d ask how you’re doing, as you’ve “dreamed stalked” me twice since the last time I saw you. I was driving by **[My college name]** on Monday night around 6, saw all these cars turning in, and remembered you had a class on Mon. night; right as I was thinking that a little white Nissan[**my car type**] drove by me.

   On that note, I don’t know why, probably due to past experience w/Samantha and something you said about a comment your own grandmother made,  I’m feeling a need to make something 100% CFC (Crystal F*&amp;#ing Clear). I believe you already know this about me by now, but I want to leave no room for (mis)interpretation – these dreams are not ever going to lead me to suggest that you are anything but a friend and former student that I am concerned about. First of all, I’m already married to the most awesome woman on the planet, one I believe is truly my soul mate and a God-send, and not only that, she’s hot! Far as I’m concerned, nowhere to move but down in that department. I may occasionally do something stupid, but no way in hell I’m stupid enough to screw that up. Plus you are -  1) too tall, 2) too young, 3) hair is way too short, 4) your politics clash w/mine (you think Obama is a good Pres.? Really?!?!?),  5) I’ve always liked straight chicks, 6) you prefer video games over board games (real sad), 7) not a Christian, and 8) if I had more time, could probably think of a few more, but I think you’re getting the picture by now. Any one of those ALONE would be a deal breaker far as I’m concerned. You (and your grandmother) have absolutely nothing to fear from me - ever. If I was a scum bag, you would have found out on our ride to John’s a couple months ago.

   Hopefully, me saying all this is merely stating what was already obvious.

   And on slightly different note, there is something I had really been trying to work up the nerve to talk to you about for several months now, just never really had the right circumstances to broach the subject. The thought actually occurred to me the day after we drove out to Eric’s together, and it’s been bugging me to bring it up ever since. That following day, our Sunday school class was doing a video series that involved how Christians have handled the issue of homosexuality (hmm, coincidence?). I of course immediately thought of you. I’ve never seemed to have trouble talking to you (perhaps unfortunately for you ; )), as I know I’ve kind of dumped on you when my niece &amp; mom died, which incidentally is I think one of the reasons I’ve tried to stay in touch w/you, in addition to your being a great addition to any gaming group. Circumstances have just led to you being one of several former students, like Eric, Houston and several others, that I’ve come to care a little bit more about.  

   Anyway, I would love to be able to have a conversation about Christians and gays one of these days, assuming you are willing to. I have several questions, and a couple concerns. And if you’re just not comfortable with that, I’ll understand.

   And also, being a spiritual guy, I can’t dismiss all those dreams as meaningless or mere coincidence. I mean, 10 plus times?  Now, as to what that means, I still have no clue. I told Francine**[his wife]** about it and she said to just pray for you. I’d actually already been doing that regularly for quite some time; I started to regularly after something you said at one of the club meetings. 

   OK, this ended up being A LOT longer than I had planned on it being when I started. Glad I didn’t try to text all this. : )  Really hope you are doing OK, and that you will be in touch AND join us for some gaming soon. I don’t know if I’m heading to Greg &amp; Riley’s on Sat. or Sun. yet, if one of those works better for you &amp; you can join us, lemme know ASAP.

Also, I know this guy who has been poor for the last few years. He's been working minimum wage. When Obama said he wanted to raise the minimum wage he went on facebook and ranted about how it would only help crack addicts and how he had to ""work for everything I have! Why shouldn't they!?"". Never mind the fact that raising the minimum wage would help him massively (or at least would, I think he got another job).  Nothing worse then a self loathing poor person who thinks everybody should have to suffer because he got a shit hand in life. ""It was hard for me so it should be hard for you too!"". No you idiot, it shouldn't have to be that hard to begin with.

"First, I'm not going to down vote you for your opinion. You have a right to it, as I have a right to my own. Also, I completely disagree with the statement that marijuana makes you dumber. The problem with this type of thinking is that we take blame away from the person and attribute it to a substance. Think about how many successful and brilliant people that have existed who have smoked marijuana in recreation. A few examples: Carl Sagan (PhD), Richard Branson, Bill Maher, Barack Obama. Now, yes, there are absolutely stupid people who use marijuana as well, but as with anything, marijuana being one of them, there are undoubtedly users of all walks of life. Same with cigarettes. Same with alcohol. Same with fast food. Same with investing money. Same with video games. That being said, why should those who are able to responsibly enjoy the fruits of adulthood autonomy suffer, i.e. risk punishment from the law, from doing something so simply harmless to everyone but themselves (if at all). It's just not logical, and it's impossible to enforce. In fact, it costs more to fail enforcing it than it does to educate the young about the pros and cons of using mind altering substances. When people are sheltered and told not to do something without the ability to make their own mistakes they may become even more tempted to try it. So much that so when they do and realize that there was never really any basis for it to be a punishable offense in the first place, they may begin to try other possibly worse things than smoking a joint/cigarette or drinking a beer under 21. I do agree in the sale of cigarettes and alcohol. I believe in the legalization of most, if not all, mind altering substances. I also believe in supply and demand. If people want it, it will be available. Guaranteed. Let's take advantage of this. Regulate substances and educate others about the choices they may one day have to make so that if they ever do smoke that joint, take that hit of ecstasy, eat that fast food, make another bet at a casino, that they will hopefully do it safely and understand the benefit/risk of the situation and use it to determine whether they will partake in it the next time. Just my thoughts.",1

"Run to home depot for concrete, wood and supplies to build a safe box to hold that much money. While I'm gone my husband can start breaking up the basement floor.  Luckily we know where all the pipes run from our house to the street.  It would take a while to dig the hole, build the form, pour the concrete and let it cure.  But with that kind of money it's not like he would have to go to work.  I refuse to pay Obama 50%+ of my new windfall.

After the money was secured at least temporarily we would start making plans.  We would move out of state for sure.  But that would take time to find a place.  Our ultimate goal would be establish ourselves in a rural town but within 100 miles of a larger city where we could visit for theater and museums.  

I don't know what my husband would do.  He might start his own business or continue to work in his current field.  I would start my own charity.  It's been a long time dream to be able to help working class poor people who make too much for gov't help but still need temp assistance.  I would be able to give them grants to help with things like emergency car repairs or money to fix heaters or pay for medicine. Our daughter would finish school and we would pay for the college of her choice.  This might not be a popular opinion that even with all our money she would still have to work even a few hours a week for spending money.  I knew too many kids whose parents paid for everything and they didn't value it.  I don't want that for her. ",1
"Socialism

Everyone in America hates socialism. ""Obama's a socialist Muslim!"" they say. 

Sorry to burst your bubble, but *America is socialist*. 

Not as much as most other nations, but do you pay taxes which pay the wages of government workers, the military and the disabled? Then, my friend, you have just redistributed wealth more evenly (and to people doing jobs you will or can not do), and that is socialism. Does our government place limits and regulations on the prices of goods in the economy? Do that place safety an environmental standards on business and their products? That is socialism.

The majority of Americans make me embarrassed to be American.",4
Thanks Obama!,10
"&gt; Often, my liberal friends assume the worst possible motivation behind support for conservative policies.

Do you think this might be because of the media coverage and the message of the Republican party (inescapably tied to American Conservatism, though it might not be applicable lately)? Many prominent Republicans have come out with truly ridiculous and terrible reasons for policies, which usually do involve hatred of Obama because they are racist against him; they promote invasive policies against women because of their chauvinistic belief that the Bible grants them authority over women; they equate welfare to leeching off the government.

While a knee jerk reaction assuming that these beliefs coincide with any *particular* conservative might be unfair, it seems reasonable to conclude this, given that the reasons for the viewpoint of public members of the Republican party does sometimes stem from these awful things.

&gt;My liberal friends are huge fans of free speech until it's speech they don't like.

Generally agree with you.  How do you feel about laws banning ""speech with the intent to harm""?",1

Shut the hell up. He actually fairly well off and far from being poor. Admittedly my best friend and I's family are wealthy and go to private school. But somehow this means the fact that we go to private school immediately discredits what I think about anything political, especially about welfare, taxes, and Obama (I'm liberal by the way). and because he goes to public school he is automatically an expert on the struggles of the lower class and knows that they all take advantage of the system and are moochers (he's conservative by the way, extremely so). The most annoying thing is that only my moms side is rich, my dads side are very poor and live in the ghetto, not the extreme ghetto though. I'm actually quite aware of lower class struggles but it doesn't matter because i go to a private High school. anyway it crazy annoying. I could keep going but this is already long enough.

TL;DR: Bragging about being ""poor"" and ""redneck"" (quotes because they are probably neither if they brag about it) is annoying as dicks and does not automatically make you better than others nor does it mean you have any experience in the ""cruel"" world.",2

Now, as a middle class working person I still pay the same for health care, and extra people are being given subsidized private health insurance which in the end taxpayers will also pay for. Yet those poor people are not getting free health care either, they will still be on the hook for deductibles etc.

"Today's bunch of Christian fundamentalists weren't so much around at the founding of the country and many of them believe that the country is theirs by rights.  Also, their god is ultimately just as cruel as the Salafists' god:  all unbelievers, with very few exceptions, are going to roast in hell forever with satan and his demons.  The Salafists/Wahabbists are more instrumental in realizing their god's cruelty, that's the primary difference.  I judge a religion by the contents of its doctrines as well as by the deeds of its adherents.  

Racism today.  Let's take a look at George Zimmerman.  What are black parents supposed to tell their kids now?  At least with cops there is a code that can be abided by if you are taught it (and middle class black parents frequently do teach it), but now you've got neckbearded mall-ninjas with Glocks running around and it seems like all bets are off.  (Granted, the prosecution fucked up royally:  should've charged him with negligent homicide and given him three or four years.)  It broke my heart to see the legions of Americans lauding Zimmerman as a real American hero.  That guy should have been charged with a reasonable charge that would have rightfully stuck, and then gone to prison.

Regarding Obama.  I voted for him because he was a smart, reasonable guy, everything that Bush wasn't.  That, and I didn't want Sarah Palin to get within 5,000 miles of the Presidency.  Him being half black was icing on the cake.  However, don't underestimate the significance of the icing.  In 1996 Tupac said ""we ain't ready to see a black President"" and everybody, I mean everybody, took that for granted.  It simply wasn't imaginable.  I'm 35 and I didn't think I'd ever see it in my lifetime.  I remember in the mid 90s being in a large room full of Mexican-American high school kids.  The speaker said ""the future President of the United States might be in this room.""  Everyone was absolutely flabbergasted, shaking their heads in disbelief and shock.  ""No"", people were saying.  ""No.""  This was the late 90s, not the late 50s.  I don't mean to sound patronizing, but I think you have to be a minority to truly understand.  But now, anything truly is possible.

With that said, it's not racist to call him a bumbling ditherer.  

Those minorities that threw racial slurs over you had no power over you (unless you were going to an all black high school or something).  Racism is a matter of power.  My redneck cousin catcalls yuppie women that he sees jogging past and they just turn up their noses and ignore him.  It is contingent on who you are relative to whom.  Rednecks in pickup trucks might have only the power to hurl abuse as they pass by, but what about cops, places of employment, real estate agencies, politicians pandering to their white conservative bases, and so on?

Quick note on hip hop.  Most the gangsta stuff you refer to went out with the 1990s.  Black people also gave us jazz, the one uniquely American art form in the world, not to mention rock and roll.  Without them we'd have nothing but parlor recitals and barbershop quartets, maybe bluegrass.  Unless you're one of those people who thinks that Arnold Shoenberg is the pinnacle of 20th century music and everything else is dreck.  And of course, there was plenty of historic handwringing over jazz music, early rock and roll, 'race music' of any kind, etc.  And I have no illusions about gang culture.  Friends of mine have been murdered.

As for the 'Uncle Tom' bit.  That describes most poor people in America.  My dad's a white guy and one day my grandpa said to him ""put down those goddamn books and pick up a shovel.  You're just gonna end up shoveling chicken shit like me.""  You'll get just as much shit in the trailer park for being a nerd as you will in the ghetto.  ""What, you too good for your raisin', now?""  African immigrants are the polar opposite:  in America they're right up there with Asians in terms of achievement (though like with Asians it's a self-selecting group, those who come to America).  It seems to be an American culture of poverty, amplified a bit in the black ghetto.

Final note:  I believe in affirmative action for college admissions, but that it should shift from being based on race to being based on class.  Dr. Huxtable's kids have better lifes' chances than Billy Joe Bob's kids.  Although otherwise-qualified minority applicants being able to get jobs at many firms is still a big problem for a variety of reasons, many of them insidious.  Are we just supposed to pretend it's not a problem?

No SS or Brownshirts beating up and intimidating people, just the press out right lying to a majority of very uneducated people.",2

"JAN 14, 2013 PROPHETIC REVELATION OF GOD: AGAIN THE MESSENGER ANGEL OF GOD PASSES ON REVELATIONS ABOUT FALLEN ANGELS TO PROPHET BENJAMIN COUSIJNSEN, IN THE NAME OF THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC AND JACOB!
Please share and do not change © BC


Full view:

Hello, welcome! On January 14th, 2013, the messenger angel of God brought on the following message to Benjamin Cousijnsen.

Shalom! I greet you in the name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ. Prophet Benjamin Cousijnsen, I am Arodai, the messenger angel of God. Verily, verily, I tell you,

Benjamin, the fallen angels are superior extraterrestrial higher developed devilish technological angels.
Their appearance is as an observable beautiful angel of light.
These false angels master the linguistics, and are highly gifted in flawless English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Indonesian, Chinese and many other languages.
They have remarkable UFOs transport equipment. Also, they try to stand close to the Almighty with their knowledge.



Also, there have been taken place many today's encounters with the antichrist Obama.
The involvement with Earth is enormously! Obama is also telepathically connected with these fallen angels of satan.

Benjamin, between Mars and Jupiter is one planet, where many fallen angels are. 
And also in Mexico, in the sea, a transport base for UFOs is located.
The government remains as quiet as the grave about the fallen angels!
The antichrist and the pope and the Muslim Brotherhood have already been in touch and made plans and signed them. They want the fallen angels to reveal and show themselves! This is done already.

Ephesians 6, verse 12 For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world's rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.

Many Christians often forget to ask for protection.
Read these scriptures aloud: Romans 13, verse 12 The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let's therefore throw off the works of darkness, and let's put on the armor of light.

Isaiah 54, verse 17 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness which is of me, says the LORD.

Ephesians 6, verse 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, verily,

2 Samuel 22, verse 31 As for God, his way is perfect: The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him. 

Benjamin, some Christians want God to do everything for them, without doing anything themselves.
They are still just babies, who have it all their own way. Wake up there! God is very holy! God just wants you to fight against it. Use God's armor, cover yourself, Christian warriors, under the Blood of Jesus Christ, and defeat this chameleon. Come, stand on it, crush its head in the almighty name of Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Christ.
Thus there are many, who put aside the Holy Spirit, and just keep complaining, why God did not help them!

Job 5, verse 8 and 9 But as for me, I would seek God, To God would I commit my cause; Who does great things that can't be fathomed, Marvelous things without number.

The messenger angel of God spoke further, Verily, stand in His strength, and thank Him, who belongs all honor and worship! Amen.

I'm going now, Ruacha, Jeshu, Shalom! said the messenger angel of God, and disappeared.

SHALOM! God bless you

"IIRC, the Dem Senate majority leader prevent a vote on obamacare after Brown lost his recall election, using rules to ensure that he was not allowed to vote (which would have killed it right there). 

The people recalled him so he could vote against the law... and guess who prevented that vote from happening? The Democratic majority leader...

Also, the republicans are passing funding legislation left and right to end the shutdown. It's the Senate who is refusing to hold votes on any of these bills.",1
Maybe Obama isn't literally Jesus? ,0
"No, just an ass kicking. 

This ""government shutdown"" is really just an indefinite suspension of non-essential programs. Defense is essential so nothing changes there. Camping in a park we can do without for a little while. 

The problem here is that the Republicans have little reason to stop the shutdown. On one hand, they get the Obamacare law repealed, and on the other, they get to scale back the federal government if they don't.  So it's win/win for them no matter what happens. ",2
"Alpha is defined as 'dominant', 'first in order of importance'.

The entire debate here is how alpha is achieved. It can be through 2 ways: physical or intellectual means.

Let's evaluate dominance.

Bankers/Lawyers are people who have proven they can achieve dominance intellectually. There is nothing to suggest they can't achieve physical dominance as well. Of the people I know with the discipline to follow through bodybuilding or strenuous sports or martial arts are mostly inclined towards the intellectuals, including scholars and doctors.
Bankers/Lawyers:
- Intellect - Definite dominance.
- Physical - Nothing to suggest they can't dominate, most of them actually DO dominate. Being smart doesn't mean being weak, if Isaac Newton went bodybuilding he'd still have one of the highest IQs ever to grace humankind.

Soldiers are people who, though not all, mostly couldn't achieve dominance in intellectual fields and were hence ousted from most of modern society's intellectually-dependent paths. Don't try to argue this. I WAS in the army. This is why most of them turned to the army. They train in physical fitness, not out of their own arrogance or control, but mostly because there's sergeants screaming down at them and there's the fear of getting court-martialled. Soldiers are trained to be brainless, and to just do what they're told without question. There's practically no chance for evaluation, and when you try to you get confined or you get charged. I've been there. Would they have the arrogance, the control and discipline to keep themselves physically superior? Most soldiers I know, once they get out of basic military training, just let themselves go. They wouldn't train outside of their own unit's compulsory daily regime much. Seen their beer bellies?
Soldiers:
- Intellect - Most likely no, given the statistics I've seen. They're mostly intellectual rejects.
- Physical - They are physically fit, but not out of their own choice. They do so because there's someone screaming at them and there's the fear of being labelled weak and dishonoured by court-martials. Who's the alpha wolf, the wolf that leads the pack in killing without anyone else suggesting it at all, or every other wolf that just follows commands because they fear being ousted by the pack?


TL;DR, wars are countries fighting against one another. USA vs Iraq. It was basically Bush/Obama vs Saddam Hussein. Soldiers are basically just extensions for the people in control. Bush and Obama are Yale/Harvard graduates with law degrees.*

Soldiers? Alpha? How?

Was in the army. Now in law school. I can tell you, it takes much more aggression and dominant arrogance to survive the latter. Survive the army?

"Canadian here. I've only met a couple of Irish folks in my life, yet my ancestors are from Ireland, and Scotland. As such I tend to say ""Woo!"" to those countries as well, so you may be onto something with the pride thing. 


 (2) I found it funny the amount of ""guess I'm moving to Canada!"" posts that appeared following Obama's election, because people were afraid of his Liberalism or something, un aware that the stuff he was talking about (gay rights, healthcare) had already been here for...ever basically. Long as I can remember (or did we only legalize gay marriage in 2003? Either way, the only people I find are against it are groups of religious folks, and the older generations.)


(3) Don't know about this. I feel like we can be super impolite. I think it's actually a socio-economic thing actually. I work manual labor whilst not at uni, and the guys I work with are insanely crude. It's sad :( Politeness is a thing that changes from person to person, I think that the generalization that Canadians are polite is somewhat over rated. Still, because I like it when people are polite to me, I usually try to be polite to others, were it not for my shyness and anxiety. 


(5) Feel like this is true. Most Americans I meet seem to be entrenched in their political leaning (I live with a dude from Iowa who thinks Obama is an idiot simply because he's a democrat. He thinks Bush was alright, while we in Canada seem to tend to think Obama's nifty, and Bush was pretty awful), and fiercely patriotic. Still, as a Canadian (Manitoba, woo!) I am pretty patriotic about out country too, but, only the country. I disagree with the direction the Conservatives are taking us in, and believe our future lies in the political party that is there for our people, NOT for the economy, not for money. 



That being said, every American I've met (I've spent quite a bit of time in North/South Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota, plus grew up meeting people from Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Wisconsin, etc because my Dad is an outfitter) has been a pleasant person. Heck, I've had a crush on a girl I go to school with from Washington (the state!) since the day I met her! I feel like other than our obvious political views that come about from being from different countries, we are basically the same. That being said, I like Canada more than America simply because of our somewhat more Liberal stance. ",2

I also support Obama.  People like us are now the majority of Americans, as indicated by the last national election, in which the Democrats slaughtered the Republicans.

It just bothers me that Europeans generalize from Republicans to all Americans when so many Americans are opposed to the Republicans.  Perhaps it is because your countries are more politically homogenous and you aren't used to the idea of a country of almost 400 million people that has two substantially different political parties that have divided the country into two factions.

Edit: I based this question on the way that many European Redditors act toward Americans, not just on your post. That is why I generalized about Danes and Europeans.",2

Rand Paul is a Doctor, along with many other politicians. But in general understanding of science is weak in government.

"Obama is certainly not the sole bearer of blame, but he is the chief executive of the agencies conducting all this surveillance. Particularly, it is his prerogative to appoint secretaries/directors and set their priorities (in broad terms of course, nobody can micromanage that many agencies).

Furthermore, and most importantly, he never spoke out against the renewal of the patriot act and signed the document himself. At that point you can't blame the Bush Administration or the Republican Congresses of the early 2000's -  Obama and a Democratic Congress passed the same (and actually stronger) bill.

Nobody is solely to blame, but Obama employs the people who conduct the surveillance, and directly signed off on the laws that permit it. Therefore he bears a large amount of direct responsibility.",1

"Your ignorance is showing.

Social Security was started by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression.  The Great Depression was actually caused according to many *by the government itself* by ""monetary factors such as actions by the US Federal Reserve that contracted the money supply."" 

""Recessions and business cycles are thought to be a normal part of living in a world of inexact balances between supply and demand.""  This should be obvious, but Roosevelt had the bright idea to solve it with big brother government, rather than letting the law of supply and demand sort things out.   

SS was a entitlement program designed for a short term problem and to win Roosevelt votes, same as Obama.  Furthermore SS is a government solution for a government created problem.  The same is true for today and for Obamacare.  

I dont see how you think SS benefits the poor either.  The poor will pay a higher rate for SS than the wealthy, making it a regressive tax.  

I could go on and on about the inequalities and shortcomings of SS but you can read it yourself.

Furthermore, if you think government programs are so great, you should try living off them.

"/u/ONE_GUY_ONE_JAR made very eloquent points with the top comment, however my reasons are a bit more complicated than that.  

1. Our system was BUILT off of private health care sectors, this is why they get paid so much and why it costs so much to become a doctor.  You cannot simply change that function over night.  A lot of doctors are still in crippling amounts of debt due to the hundreds of thousands they spent on Med School, it would be unfair to them, and therefor us, to lower their wages at an increased cost to the patients that have the money.  I have a hard enough time paying for my own health care, I don't want to pay for yours as well.  And people don't get that this is how it works.  Health care expenses will go up for people that can afford it or doctors will get 0 compensation from people who CAN'T afford it.  I will fully admit that some doctors from private practice do a little too well, but that's how they ran things and they put their practice to good use.  

2. I have Crohns Disease, sometimes I need to be seen RIGHT NOW without having to pay a $50 co-pay at the ER.  You, yes you with the sore elbow, stop wasting my doctors time and making people who really need help wait.  Its already started with Obama (no I'm not anti Obama, he's an overall smart man, I just disagree with universal health care) I have to wait weeks to see my doctor mean while I'm missing school because of the pain im in.  At what point do we distinguish when a customer is abusing health care?  People will literally go to the doctor because ""My pinky toe turned a little bit pinker than the rest of my toes."" and I have to wait at the back of the line when I shit blood this morning.  

3. There are already free clinics available, people just don't know about them or are too prideful to use them.  Yes, I've been to free clinics when money was short, they kinda suck, but it's better than nothing and they're still doctors.  Why don't we make transportation run by the government?  Everyone gets a Bently, meanwhile the stoners and drunks abuse them, the guys who bike don't need them, and the dude who actually worked hard for his gets shafted. 

Sorry to say but UHC is not appropriate for our system.  Americans and America aren't ready for it.  We're a too greedy bunch, all it's going to do is cause the well oiled machine we have now to break down.",0

I got hate mail about a comment I made about Michelle Obama a MONTH after the fact from some republican who thinks I'm destroying America. It was the most bafflingly hilarious thing I've ever dealt with here.,3
"I hate AA, specifically American Eagle. I was flying from SJC to ORD last year, and our flight was delayed about 3 hours. This caused me to miss my connecting flight by 2 minutes and be stuck in Chicago overnight.

Our plane had been delayed because of weather in Chicago, which I'm guessing backed up flights trying to land. AA knew my flight was delayed, so my plane was in touch with American Eagle (the local charter service for my connecting flight) and told them to hold the plan for about 5-10 minutes. The attendants let me leave the plane first, and I literally ran from one end of ORD to the other (AA lands in one section, but departs from another) to try and get there right away. 

They didn't wait. When I complained they said that the delay was because of weather, so AA wasn't responsible for me missing my flight. All I got was a discounted hotel room, which they ""shouldn't do but will do this one time"" since AA isn't responsible for delays caused by weather.

I go to the shuttle service to get to the hotel. There's a bunch of United passengers being put up as well, for free. Why? Because Obama was flying in through Chicago that night which caused the terminal to be vacated while he went through. Looked it up online, and Obama indeed had landed at ORD that night.

Contacted ORD about it and was told that they had it marked as weather, so nothing they could do.

I'd never fly AA again, but the airports near me are pretty much always AA, so I'm stuck. ",1

"But they haven't, YET.  I agree that they WILL.  But right now, we are not talking about money that has already been spent yet, because the Democrats are blocking nearly all of the appropriations bills until they get 100% of what they want in one bill.  The Republicans will eventually cave, of course, and the debt ceiling will have to be raised, because even the Republicans are willing to spend far more than we bring in from revenue.

Even if the Republicans completely got what they have been asking for in this particular battle (elimination of the medical devices tax, elimination of Obamacare subsidies for Congress, and a one year delay for the individual mandate), they will still end up appropriating more money (about 50% more) than what we bring in.  That means we will have to raise the debt ceiling.

But that is not true, at this very moment, since very few appropriations bills have gotten past the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Let's theorize that the Republicans cave in this current continuing resolution fight, and then we move on to the debt ceiling, and negotiations fail completely.

What happens then?

You are correct in saying that the 14th amendment stipulates that government debts are legally binding.  However, not all appropriations are debts.  In fact, most of them are not.

You could make a monthly budget with grand plans to buy a flat screen TV and a massive entertainment center, but if you only bring in $1,000 that month, and your mortgage is $700, then... well...

No flat screen for you!",1
"Many Americans dislike the healthcare system for a variety of reasons. Some feel that government funded healthcare is bad, simply because if their personal political views. Some don't mind government healthcare, but aren't happy with how this bill is structured because you need to be quite poor to get obamacare, but regular insurance is quite costly so there's a gap between those ""too rich"" for obamacare and those ""rich enough"" to afford private care. Others do not like how obamacare has affected private insurance. 


I'm a student under my parents insurance, so I don't have a strong opinion either way (yet). I know that my parents strongly opposed it because they are self insured, not through an employer, and their insurance rates went up significantly. As did their deductible. So, more money but less coverage. 


Whether an American likes or dislikes obamacare strongly depends on where they stand financially. If they stand to be on the side that benefits  and doesn't directly pay, they support it. If they stand on the side that is paying, whether through increased insurance premiums or taxes, they may not support it. Obviously it's not as clear cut as that, but those are some reasons. ",1

"I believe it, but I don't think Snowden is a hero by any means.

First, by running off to China and then Russia, the story was turned into a story about him than a story about the NSA.  There were many better ways to go about it (say, hook up with a Libertarian in Congress, like Rand Paul, and come forward with the support that that office holds.  Public opinion would be higher than now, and that sentiment would keep him out of prison).  He should have stayed home and help shape the discussion.

Second, he shouldn't have talked about any sort of international spying.  Every country spies as much as it can.  This was a very bad ""PR"" move on his part and gives ammunition to anyone who'd paint him as a traitor.

This guy has a history of difficulty with authority.  Left high school.  Couldn't make it in the military.  I think his personal motive has more to do with him being a douche, and getting off on fucking with authority.  No matter what he says now, no Ron Paul supporter was happy with Obama and hopeful that he'd ""be different"".  If he really cared about the 4th Amendment and the American citizens, he wouldn't have, in my judgement, released any information about international spying.

(And as for Obama continuing the spy programs?  Democrats have been called ""weak on terror"" for the past decade.  People have said Obama is a Muslim who is an ally of Al Qaeda.  If he stopped any ""anti-terror"" program it would leak, and the next attack would be ""his fault"".

Furthermore, I don't think Ron Paul himself would have stopped the NSA spying if he was president.  All Presidents worry about their legacy, and they all know we will be attacked again.  Any President who stops spying on Al Qaeda will be blamed for subsequent attacks.  The citizens want less terrorists attacks more than they care about their rights (see the response to the Boston Bombing where people ""sheltered in place"" and let police search their houses without warrants.  Also see the response to 9/11, when they were willing to let government search anything, including library records.  Anyone who protested was asked, ""what do you have to hide?"" and called ""weak on terror"").

I don't think any President will end this spy program, because eventually there will be an attack that could have been prevented and everyone will judge with 20/20 hindsight.",2

Personally, I'm apathetic about the politics in my own country.  Watching the Daily Show (yes, probably not the best way to get into US politics) I am just bamboozled by the personalities that are around.  With Obama, I was sort of hoping that he would have the chance to mop up the mess left behind by the Bush administration, but I think I was aware of the fact that stalemates seem to happen a lot in America.

During the last election I was kind of worried about the Global situation if Mitt Romney had gotten through.  Maybe not WWIII, but I was expecting a lot of um... new reasons for other politician to apologise for having Romney in charge.

My general view of the two parties:

Democrats are trying to get one up over the other party, but try and help everyone which doesn't always work.

Republicans are supporters of the rich and guns.  I'm not sure which is scarier.  They want to keep the status quo even if you have to prize it out of their cold, dead hands.

That's when I realized (talking like 14) that both parties are failures and work in black and white. It honestly made me sad.

You share these incredibly intimate moments. You share love. You have sex. You have someone to share your thoughts with. You have someone to rely on.

The first year is great and awful. You find that person and you develop feelings. You explore how you feel with each other and discover that you both have affection for each other. That eventually blossoms into love. And you do cool things together. You go on living your life the same way as you did before, as does she. You give each other your space and you hang out occasionally. Occasionally turns to frequently. You see each other once a week and long to see each other twice when your schedules line up. You talk on the phone for hours. You chat during the day on the computer. You get to know the other person. You go out and have fun.

Eventually you start to discover some fatal flaws in your ideals and relationships. She wants X this way, you want Y that way. House. Kids. Family. Pets. Career priorities. Vacation priorities. Money. Etc. Not everything lines up. But it's good because you're just two friends having a great time together and also banging like jackrabbits. You're experimenting with every position and every place in the house or apartment or cardboard box with rope lights. Wherever you are, you're banging and banging and banging.

You start to stay over her place or he stays over your place. You practically live together...until you do. Expectations start to set in. ""I'm hanging out with my buddies on Saturday."" ""But Saturday's our date night."" ""Well, I'll take you out Sunday, or you're welcome to join us on Saturday."" ""I don't want to get in the way of guy's night, plus it's breaking tradition!"" So you compromise on things like that. And you have fights over things like that. ""Sorry I'm not thrilled on our date night. I wanted to see my friends and I see you every day. But I sacrificed for you and don't feel appreciated for it."" ""I'm sorry you see me as a burden."" So you get in your first real fights. And they last. And they linger. And sometimes they get resolved. Sometimes they don't. But those fights can take hours. And you sit there and you have to remember not to react or get mad. But you can't just take shit and have to stand up for what you believe. It just sucks. For hours. It just sucks. You want to resolve it and go back to cuddling and watching movies. But she's furious. Or you're furious because she doesn't see what's important to you.

Eventually you move in together and really test it out. You love waking up to the other person every morning. You snuggle in your sleep. You get a pet. You get furniture. And then serious things get tested. Your career is the biggest one. Some nights you have to work late. It's just the way the economy is (Thanks, Obama ! :) ). You get a big opportunity at work because that's how work goes. And even though you're spending more time at work and making more money for the household, you're not there for her as much as she wants you to be. You get frustrated and require more space to cool down. Sometimes she gives it to you. Sometimes that space becomes the thing that distances you. You talk about it and work it out. You compromise. And the compromises are never satisfying.

A few years in and you still love each other greatly. You might not snuggle as much while sleeping together. Sometimes you just want to turn to the side and sleep without your arm going numb. Work gets better. Your friends disappear slowly as they get in relationships. You spend more time with her than you do with your friends. Fights about expectations and priorities still happen. Work or relationship? Compromises happen. At this point you've met her family. They have gone from seeing you as the guy who's boning their daughter to the guy who is taking care of her. You spend less time with your family and more time with her. She takes up your time now. She becomes the most important thing in life.

The next few years are a lot more of the same. And you start to either grow together or grow apart. For me, growing apart happened quite a bit. She found new interests. I stayed the same. She wanted to do new things more and more to keep things interesting. I wanted to save money because living with 8 dudes in a house to two people in a townhouse really changes your expenses. You question your job situation and figure out what's important: stability or career growth. She's losing interest because things stay the same. After all, they're going to when you see each other every day and most nights you don't want to do something new. Back when it was new, that distance brought you together. Now, the closeness pulls you apart. So you spend more money on vacations, nights out, restaurants, and things get renewed. You have to find ways to keep spicing it up.

Year four and five, it really gets tough. You figure out so many ways to keep reminding her of your love. But they're getting old. She's getting bored. The fights drag you down and you're getting weary. The expectations of your salary are higher. She wants to get a house and maybe even kids or marriage. You're not ready because this shit is fucking tough. Accumulation over the years of fights, expectations, priorities, baggage from previous relationships, poor decisions, changes in personality and priorities, all wear you down. You have fewer friends to rely on, and you have trouble telling your best friend in the world some things. An old conversation may have been, ""My boss is a jackass. I'm tired of being shit on at work."" ""You'll make it, hun. Just have faith."" That turns to: ""My boss is a jackass."" ""You should be boss. Why aren't you boss?"" ""Because that requires 4 more hours at work each day and you already say we don't spend enough time together."" ""Well you should be earning more. Stop selling yourself so short. I don't want to be with a guy with no confidence. "" ""I have confidence but I..."" ""I'm not looking for solutions. I just want to share with you how I feel.""

Family strains really come in at this point. Their problems become yours, even more so than ever. And there are tougher times ahead. You have to find new ways to keep reconnecting. You end up watching Sister Wives or whatever shit she wants to watch most of the time. Eventually she gets mad when you do everything she wants to do because guys want to please and women want to be treated like princesses. It grates on you. It burns your soul apart. And love has gone from this sparkle you feel to a double-sided dagger between your hearts that stabs you both each time you hug.

If you manage to resolve your problems and can work together and maintain your friendship and relationship, maybe you get married. And I can't speak for married folks. For me, I'm at the six year mark. It feels like it's at the end. She finally got a big promotion and spends more time at work and meets so many new people there. They all live exciting lives and are young and single and have money, and by comparison I'm a boring fuck who doesn't come up with new, exciting things to do every week like everyone at work. We come home and see each other and care about each other sooooo much. It's true love. But the little things become big things. And if you're both good at problem solving, you just have to spend the time to work on these. If not, they become deal breakers. But they wear on you. You don't look forward to coming home every day. You see each other so much that you don't just chat on the phone or on the computer all day. And one of you misses that. You never make enough money. You never will. You're never available or too available. Expectations are too high, set by standards you can't possibly ever meet. And what guides you past that point is the strength of your love and your ability to work things out and see life together in the long term. Commitment is inevitable. You grow apart. But can your relationship handle that.

TL;DR: It's fucking awesome and exciting at first. Become best friends. You bang like crazy. Meet parents. Move in. Accumulation of fights wears you down. Eventually you get bored of the day to day with each other. Expectations are high. Life pulls you apart. It becomes very difficult. True love becomes the glue that binds two heavily-cracked hearts together.

"I was self pay for 10 yrs with my kids. The cost to go to the doctor was 75$ to 150$. My sons meds were 2,000$ a month, before I had insurance and this was with the pharmacy and doc doing hacks with everything the could get their hands on to get it at that price. I HAD wonderful awesome insurance intill this year. Now I still have insurance but I have a deductible and I may have to change my son's doctors. My son broke his arm when we were self-pay, we made 200$ more a month to not get Medicaid for our kids. I asked the hospital for help and they said I had to get Medicaid to get any drop in price. My company is union so even though I work part time I got this awesome insurance, but if I had kept it I would have to pay taxes on my insurance. My company said that my insurance was 13,000$ a year. I make less than 20,000$ a year. I want this to work but I am telling you now that I would have to take the penalty tax for not having insurance because I could not afford the monthly bill for family insurance from Obamacare. I also couldn't afford the 3,000$ penalty for not having insurance. Can you see where I am coming from. How is this helping the lower middle class? And with what my husband and I make, and because when we were doing better we were able to get a house, we don't get any help from the government. Even though we are considered proverty level, we have a house so the government considered this.",1

"I was completely unbiased when I started listening. I didn't know who he was and what his point of views were. I was trying to get a better handle on american politics.

What I got  recently were 3 weeks of unrelented, unbalanced and unfair conspiracy theories: 

Republicans object to X? OBAMA WANTS THEM TO!

GOP takes distance of Tea Party ? OBAMA IS LAUGHING YOU GUYZ!

"Australian here:

The American system of government is designed to be gridlocked and to limit the power of government, as the founding fathers intended. American's do not seem to realise this and blame current Government and President for all woes.

At the moment Barack Obama is great, while I didn't expect anything to change, and I'm not sure why anyone else did? he provided hope and inspiration, he was an actual leader, someone you could be proud of. Right now Democrats and Republicans are both retarded, but Republicans have gone off the deep end and decided to just throw tantrums and self destruct, I hope that they are voted out of the country.
Democrats are silly in many ways, but they seem harmless in their silliness.
IE Republican silliness leads to war, Democrat silliness leads to a government program which may or may not actually be wasteful or inefficient. It's hard to tell with the media over there.

Conservatives like to call the media liberal, and while it may be, all the media is reactionary and inflammatory which favours the Republican's current method of business.

Couple of specific things which make the American people look bad and prone to apathy and then hyper outrage:
Guantanamo Bay - Obama signed an order closing it soon after taking office. Every other country in the world unanimously noped the fuck out when it came time to taking back their citizens who had been jailed there.
People blame Obama for going back on his promise.
NSA - People absolutely lose their shit about terrorism, I remember seeing on the news after the Boston Bombing of people absolutely losing their shit and in hysterics. They were no in Boston at the time of the bombing. Meanwhile 3 people died, which is less then a car crash.
Due to the nature of terrorism which has changed to Al Qaeda et al trying to radicalise individuals in their home countries, monitoring people communications is the only way to determine if someone is viewing terrorist websites and accessing materials, as they would keep it to themselves.
People lose their shit about this.

You either want to be protected from Terrorists or you accept the fact that there will be a small number of attacks that can't be stopped.

The NSA's mission is to eavesdrop on communications, it is not a secret agency, it's Prism program was known in the 90's. I don't understand why people care of all a sudden.

That's my take on American Government, you have what you deserve.",3

The more I think about it today the more I'm wavering on my conclusion on what will happen with Prop 8, too. Roberts' surprise ruling on Obamacare made me highly doubt that we can gain any insight based upon how the court acts during oral arguments.

"&gt;A lot of people think they're entitled to something from the government. 

We are entitled to a gov that uses the taxes it is given responsibly for the betterment of the country and its inhabitants.

However, the gov is not responsible for holding your hand and wiping your ass. I quite agree that the overall entitlement is running rampantly out of control in the US, and the gov is continuing to focus on the wrong ways to solve the problems (eg. obamacare and bailouts to companies like GM). Rather than solving the issues at their core, like why healthcare services are ungodly expensive often for no reason at all and the borderline monopolies that some pharma companies have in various drugs. Even allowing health insurance companies to compete federally instead of by state (like car insurance is now) would do wonders for insurance costs due to increased competition.",1

"&gt;Obama promised an open and transparent government. His administration has been the most secretive in history.

Obama can promise to give every American a million dollars, what he says he will do before he gets elected and what he's actually able to do as president are two different things. If you fell head over heals for Obama over a couple of catchy slogans instead of being realistic, that's your fault, plain and simple. As for being the most secretive in history, I'm going to have to call bullshit on that one. Just because he isn't sharing everything he said he would share doesn't mean he's being secretive.

&gt;His DoJ has gone after and prosecuted more whistleblowers than any administration before him.

Don't peek just yet, but I want you to guess the number of whistleblowers that have been prosecuted under the Obama administration. Do you have a number, yet? Is that number six? If not, you're wrong. Yes, Obama has prosecuted a grand total of six people for whistleblowing, which comes out to about 1.25 people a year. Not exactly such a powerful statement anymore, right. It's interesting that people like you always say how ruthless Obama supposedly is towards whistleblowers, but conveniently leave out the number of people his administration has actually prosecuted.

&gt;Manning got 35 years in prison (which is more time, on average, than rapists, child molesters, and murderers receive), and you think Snowden is going to get off with a ""light punishment""? What Koolaid have you been drinking.

That would be because Manning was charged under the [UCMJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice), which carries much harsher punishments than civilian laws do. Snowden was a contractor, he will be charged under civilian law and his charges are much less severe than Manning's, so yes, he will get a relatively light punishment. If you had bothered to do more than zero seconds of research on this issue, all of this would have been common knowledge to you.

&gt;""Intelligence agencies collect intelligence."" Never in my life have I heard a more succinct justification for the NSA and DoJ disregarding the Constitution in my life. Bravo.

Except for the fact none of what the NSA has alleged to have been doing is unconstitutional, so there's that. Also, the Constitution doesn't apply to people who aren't citizens, in case you didn't know.

&gt;Obama promised an open, transparent presidency and spoke out against the mass dragnet surveillance apparatus when he was a Senator and when he was campaigning for President. He's delivered exactly the OPPOSITE.

No, he's simply continued policies and programs already started by previous administrations. He is not single-handedly responsible for any of it, regardless of how much you'd like to think otherwise. Again, if you buy into silly pre-election slogans, you're a moron. Perhaps you ought to familiarize yourself with the concept of [realpolitik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik) instead of being naïve enough to think Obama is some kind of magical wizard who could fix things with his magic wand.

&gt;Edit: I voted for Obama both times. My dad warned me not to buy into the hype too much, that despite his promises, he was a very centric, down-the-middle politician. My dad was right.

Whose fault is it that you didn't listen? It didn't exactly take Nostradamus to realize that, so maybe next time you'll pay more attention. Stop using the president as a scapegoat for everything you don't like. If you're trying to pass yourself off as a remotely educated voter, you should know that politics is far more nuanced than that.

"The vitriol against Obamacare.  

Is it just that you perceive your tax dollars going to pay for other people's health care?  Or it is racism/dislike of the guy who it's named after?

Because it looks to me like we have had inefficient universal health care forever anyway.  Hospitals can't turn people away untreated, and that's why the poor so often use an emergency room as a primary care provider.  Then they just don't pay their bills.  What is the hospital going to do, garnish their non-existent wages? No, they raise prices for those who can pay, inefficiently.

So I guess I just don't see how any system could really be worse than what we have right now.  I understand wanting to change provisions of Obamacare or refine it, sure.  But to completely abolish it and go back to an all-private healthcare system?

I really would welcome a well-thought out explanation.  Right now it feels like the 'Right' (who I think are 99% good people) have been pawns of a political game they don't understand (and that I don't understand either).  That's just my sense of it.

If there's a good reason for a war, liberals will largely be in favor too (such as when Pearl Harbor was attacked). Attacking a country that was absolutely no threat to us and wasn't aiding any enemy of ours is simply insane and morally bankrupt.

There aren't too many protests about Afghanistan because we aren't suffering many casualties over there and are scheduled to pull out sometime next year.

If Obama had authorized an invasion of Libya or Syria, you better believe there would be anti-war protests.",1

Congress will vote on what to do, but since they can't agree on which faction to support, they can't do anything. The two factions will be left to fight among themselves.

Your political parties are like religion, and your president is almost like god!

Though I'll be honest, when Obama won and gave that speech I got chills. Bush was fairly awful in many respects and the ""change"" message was exactly what the US needed at that time. Obviously he has turned out to be a massive disappointment, worse on civil liberties, war and almost everything else. But at the time, I did get swept up in it.

But the thing that surprised me the most was how much money was involved in campaigning, with candidates being like rock stars with parading fans chanting their name, and these huge speeches with balloons falling from the ceiling. Combine it with all the ""fame"" based around the president - the secret service, the bulletproof limos, air force one, marine one, the way his daily movement is reported constantly in US news - you have essentially made him a rock star or a god.

Attack ads are hilarious. It simply never happens here. I don't know if they're illegal or something, but I've never seen one.

Or maybe you can explain to me how you take a limited amount of funds and keep EVERYONE alive without anyone making a decision on where the money goes? Are you claiming it's first come first serve (lol)? Or are you claiming that the amount being spent on the ACA is going to be unlimited regardless of cost and that there isn't an appropriated budget and that the amount is just infinite? Come one, you claim to be educated... then explain how, logically, you can have limited funds and nobody deciding how those funds are spent. Considering it's done everywhere else with socialized healthcare this ought to be interesting. Though, I doubt you are even educated so I won't be surprised when you just retort with ""nuhh uhhh"" and then remain living in denial.

"&gt;What do you advocate?

* Repeal of Obamacare
* Elimination of not-for-profit status for some medical service providers \*
* Reorientation to true not-for-profit status for those providers that actually *are* not-for-profit
* Elimination of anti-trust &amp; anti-monopoly exemptions for health insurance providers
* Removal of the AMA's exclusive licensing of doctors &amp; nurses
* Menu pricing for all health services \*
* Insurance reduced to *true* insurance status
* Gutting of insurance regulations in general
* Gutting of Medicare / Medicaid regulations in general \*


\* Most ""not-for-profit"" healthcare is *actually* ""we pay all our massive profits to our exec staff to skirt the law"". 

\* Medicare / Medicaid regulations prohibit posting of service costs, and massively distort health care pricing models, if you were not aware.

There's a good start that would eliminate a huge chunk of the problems created by government interference in the last few decades.

&gt;I thought the US system was fucked just as much by private insurance companies - do they not bear responsibility?

Certainly they do, but the massive amount of regulation in the USA, along with exemption from anti-trust and anti-monopoly regulations, result in a finance-industry situation where only the massive companies can meet the regulatory requirements, which means only massive companies exist, which means no competition, which means high prices &amp; poor service.

The best way to make insurance companies bear responsibility is to subject them to market forces, so that they *have no choice but to bear responsibility*, and so that they are forced to conform to market demands instead of being protected from the market by the government. ",6

"It's not that simple according to [Debt Limit: Options and the Way Forward](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/09/debt-limit-options-and-the-way-forward). Excerpt follows. TL;DR: **There is far more than enough tax money flowing in to cover ongoing interest payments. Whether the Treasury can or will do so is a matter of dispute.**

""If Congress does not raise the debt limit by mid-October, the Treasury would not necessarily default on debt obligations. Even while cash-strapped, the Treasury can reasonably be expected to prioritize principal and interest payments on the national debt, protecting the full faith and credit of the United States above all other spending. It is almost impossible to conceive that the Treasury and the President would choose to default on debt obligations because doing so would have damaging economic consequences.
Nevertheless, the Treasury and the President have repeatedly invoked the threat of default to pressure Congress into raising the debt ceiling without substantial spending cuts and policy reforms. In July, Secretary Lew said on ABC’s This Week: “Congress can’t let us default. Congress has to do its work.”[6] On August 26, he wrote to Congress: “Congress should act as soon as possible to protect America’s good credit by extending normal borrowing authority well before any risk of default becomes imminent.”[7] President Obama also mentioned default at the G-20 summit: “That includes making sure we don’t risk a U.S. default over paying bills we’ve already racked up.”[8]
The Treasury justifies this threat by arguing that it lacks the logistical means and the authority to prioritize federal payments and will instead delay all payments, including debt obligations, in the event of a debt limit impasse. This interpretation of authority directly contradicts a previous statement by the Government Accountability Office, which asserted that the Treasury has the discretion to prioritize payments:
We are aware of no statute or any other basis for concluding that Treasury is required to pay outstanding obligations in the order in which they are presented for payment unless it chooses to do so. Treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States.""",250

"My 2nd grade teacher. She told me repeatedly, and my parents once at parent-teacher conference night (yeah, that went swimmingly) that because of my ""unusual"" name (hint: my name isn't Mike) and my being a minority, I probably would not go far in life. That my name would hold me back in life.

I was seven, so this was 1986 or thereabouts.

Shortly after President Obama winning the election in 2008, I was consumed with the need to write a letter to this woman to let her know that even though what she said to me hurt, I never let it get in the way of me being successful in life, and that a person's name is in no way a metric of how far they'll go in life.

"I'm thinking, given US political and public opinion climes right now, even if the US did lose troops to a North Korean attack unless Kimmy boy was actually stupid enough to nuke Hawaii (or the west coast if they're keeping something secret about their missile programs) if China got on the big red phone to the Oval Office and were like ""You hold down the fort in South Korea, we totally got this."" Obama would be quite happy to let them do their thing. He might offer them some Logistics or Intelligence support so that he can turn to the American people and say ""While China's taking the lead we're going to be sure to be right there ensuring justice for our fallen troops"".

As to escalating in Kind, I think it'd come down to what wins out: military sense or political sense. A counter Nuking is pretty much out of the question unless you want to destroy every diplomatic advance you've made with China over the last 50 years. An Agent Orange type solution would probably be treated comparably by the world at large given the horrendous ecological damage it will do (and the stigma Agent Orange still carries, especially in Asia). Carpet Bombing and the associated civilian deaths would probably be the ""Safest"" solution that makes military sense, but then the government has to decide if they go straight to that and risk political suicide, or start with ""targetted strikes"" and hope the CIA actually knows where all of NK's nuclear facilities are.",2

"&gt; This whole privacy thing was all Bush's doing when he enacted the patriot act. 

Domestic spying existed way before Bush's presidency. It actually started with the Foreign Intelligence Act of 1978 passed by President Jimmy Carter and a Democrat majority congress. The act allowed for, ""surveillance [in order to] acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party [and] If a United States person is involved, judicial authorization [is] required within 72 hours after surveillance begins"". Bush passed the Patriot act (an amendment of FISA) with bipartisan support in 2001. To say after almost five years of not being President of the United States that it is *still* his fault is absurd. President Bush and his colleagues in Congress may have paved the way for the NSA but Obama and the majority in Congress from 2008-2010 could have changed that and they didn't. This goes beyond party lines. This abomination of surveillance has been in the making for quite some time now.",1

Give the guy some slack. He comes from 2000 years worth of dogma that is indisputable... and hes trying to do the best he can to bring the Church into the 21st century with the tools he has. Tools which are sadly scarce.",2
"For some perspective, Ta-Nehisi Coates' September 2012 [""Fear of a Black President"" article from *The Atlantic*](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/fear-of-a-black-president/309064/) puts into some context the reaction to the shooting before Obama spoke, as well as what specifically he called for: a thorough investigation into the shooting.

&gt;The reaction to the tragedy was, at first, trans-partisan. Conservatives either said nothing or offered tepid support for a full investigation—and in fact it was the Republican governor of Florida, Rick Scott, who appointed the special prosecutor who ultimately charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder. As civil-rights activists descended on Florida, *National Review*, a magazine that once opposed integration, ran a column proclaiming [“Al Sharpton Is Right.”](http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/294226/al-sharpton-right-rich-lowry) The belief that a young man should be able to go to the store for Skittles and an iced tea and not be killed by a neighborhood-watch patroller seemed un­controversial.
&gt;
&gt;By the time reporters began asking the White House for comment, the president likely had already given the matter considerable thought. Obama is not simply America’s first black president—he is the first president who could credibly teach a black-studies class. He is fully versed in the works of Richard Wright and James Baldwin, Frederick Douglass and Malcolm X. Obama’s two autobiographies are deeply concerned with race, and in front of black audiences he is apt to cite important but obscure political figures such as George Henry White, who served from 1897 to 1901 and was the last African American congressman to be elected from the South until 1970. But with just a few notable exceptions, the president had, for the first three years of his presidency, strenuously avoided talk of race. And yet, when Trayvon Martin died, [talk Obama did:](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57403200-503544/obama-if-i-had-a-son-hed-look-like-trayvon/)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids, and I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together—federal, state, and local—to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But my main message is to the parents of Trayvon Martin. If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon. I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves, and that we’re going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.
&gt;
&gt;The moment Obama spoke, the case of Trayvon Martin passed out of its national-mourning phase and lapsed into something darker and more familiar—racialized political fodder. The illusion of consensus crumbled. [Rush Limbaugh denounced](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74479.html) Obama’s claim of empathy. *The Daily Caller*, a conservative Web site, [broadcast all of Martin’s tweets](http://dailycaller.com/2012/03/26/the-daily-caller-obtains-trayvon-martins-tweets/), the most loutish of which revealed him to have committed the un­pardonable sin of speaking like a 17-year-old boy. A white-­supremacist site called Stormfront produced a photo of Martin with pants sagging, flipping the bird. *Business Insider* posted the photograph and took it down without apology when it was revealed to be a fake.

Indeed, at the time, [Republican presidential candidate (and eventual nominee) Mitt Romney *also* called for a ""thorough investigation""](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/23/obama-trayvon-martin-tragedy).

Coates' article goes far beyond the scope of the Martin-Zimmerman case. But it does illustrate the [tightrope act Obama often has to play on issues like this.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/the-impossibility-of-being-barack-obama/276065/) This is *not* to be an apologist for everything Obama does, to be sure. There are principled reasons to oppose Obama's positions from the left, right, and center—whatever ""center"" can objectively mean. In this case, however, it seems more like the case got politicized not because of anything intrinsic to Obama's remarks. Rather, many of his political opponents seem to have formed their positions in reaction to Obama's, and that, together with American political polarization, is what ultimately politicized this case.",2
"I would not deny that they certainly are at a distinct advantage by starting in life so well. Many of these politicians have family connections, or connections through friends and alumni relations. But the same could be said for every prestigious job that is selective, such as investment banking and such. The point is, just because they are given a silver spoon, doesn't mean they aren't smart.

Sure, they are not *the* smartest people in the world. There is probably someone better at economics than President Obama. There is probably someone better at military theory than Obama. There is probably someone better at healthcare administration than Obama etc etc. The same can be said for every other politician. What makes politicians successful, is being able to negotiate and understand topics. President Obama doesn't need to understand the intricacies of a new trade tariff to the level that someone writing a thesis on it would, but he does need to get a firm grasp on it.

That is what the army is for, and if they didnt want to take the chance, they would not have enlisted in the army. America averages a major war every 15-20 years, and this could have been foreseen by anyone enlisting. If you say that about the Iraqi War, then you need to say it about Korea, Vietnam, Dessert Shield/Storm, etc. All wars have an economic reason for the party initiating, and can be same for the party being attacked. They do not wish for someone to gain power from their economic loss. That is just the way of life, and if you were in power, you would initiate war at one time or another. If not, you are either extremely lucky to live in a time of peace or do not know what you are doing. Obama started wars, and every other president before him has had his hands bloodied.

Because it's that concept which I believe people mistakenly believed when the Obama administration was campaigning for this.

"Russia and China are actively blocking UN resolutions that would place sanctions on the Assad regime. They are exerting their political tools in an effort to keep other states (the US namely) from getting involved, but it appears likely that will not matter and the US will be involved in a short time.

It isn't for sure that it was the Assad regime that used the weapons yet, but many assert it was them. They definitely had the means to use them, but as of yet, it seems possible that another group may have used them. We don't know yet. President Obama has said the US will be releasing intelligence documents which they are using as their basis for ramping up towards military action.

The motives for the various Syrian rebel groups are extremely diverse. This all started back in the Arab Spring when protests took place, then government crackdowns followed. Rebels took arms, began fighting the regime, and the fighting increased in brutality and portions of the Syrian army joined the rebel side. Over the last few years lots of groups have poured over the borders from different middle-eastern nations joining the fight. Now after so long there are tons of factions and in turn many motives for fighting.

There is a significant sectarian (or religious) element to the Syrian Civil War now. The Assad family and many within the ruling regime are Alawites, a branch of Shia Islam. The majority of the populous is Sunni though, as is the case in many Muslim nations (Iran being the big exception). The Arab Spring began as more of a secular (or non-religious) movement but as the situation drew out this was less and less the case.

There are very few similarities between this situation and that in Iraq before the US invaded and ousted Saddam Hussein. Iraq was not in a state of civil war when the US invaded in 2003. If you were thinking of Egypt, the dictator in that case was Hosni Mubarak. If you were thinking of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi was the dictator there. The people of Egypt overthrew their government in a more peacful fashion, while Libya also had a Civil War which ended after a UN resolution employed no-fly zones and air strikes (enforced mostly by the US and other NATO countries).",2

This all is a fucking joke. I am surprised that there are still a number of individuals who are asking ""Why blame obama?"". He is breaking the law by the very means of authorizing the secretive and illegal seizure of data coming from millions of citizens, that is why. 

A sincere fuck you to those who are not upset by this, because it is that kind of behavior that will enable an administration to push the envelop even further.

We put you in office (well I didn't this time around); we deserve to be addressed when something fucked up happens. Instead of addressing us directly on this matter, allegedly it was more of a priority for the administration to seek out prosecutions of those who, in an act of ultimate patriotism, leaked out the information that alluded to a program responsible for a breach of the 4th amendment.

Get up, get angry, and don't be afraid to resent the man that we all once hoped would bring about change for the good.

Iron man suits. Hop on it Obama ,3
"The main issue is purely political.  You have to go back to when Obama won election for his first term.  The Republicans immediately came out and said their priority number 1 is to make him a 1-term president.  This is where they began their obstructionist tactics.  When Obama came out with the Affordable Care Act the Republicans immediately saw the need to attack it in an attempt to derail what is and will be Obama's signature legislation for his presidency.  To do this they began a massive media spin campaign spearheaded by the extremist right to make the ACA look as bad as possible.  This was despite the basis for the ACA is the system currently in place in Massachusetts which was created by former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.  

First the Republicans tried to derail it in the courts, which is fine for that is how the system of checks and balances works in this country.  The courts upheld the individual mandate portion of the law but as a tax since the IRS is the entity that handles the fine for not having coverage.  (I will take this moment to point out, the reason behind the mandate is the same reason behind why states have a mandate to own auto insurance... the uninsured were costing the insured massive amounts of money.  If you wonder why your 2 ibuprofen cost $20... you're paying for that uninsured guy who went to the ER with a cough.)

This pissed off the Republicans even more so they went back to the media and especially Fox News to spread whatever they could think of (i.e. death panels, rationing ect).  Well we come to the next election and the GOP was dead set on their promise of making Obama a 1-term president.  They lose.... again.  Which brings us to the budget battle and the desperate Republicans to get some sort of um.. victory(?) against the ACA since it has been their main point of attack for almost 4 years now.  

With all this being said.. the ACA is not as bad as people say.  Yes there are parts which need to be tweaks but that is certainly something the Obama Administration and the Democrats are open to doing.  The ACA tries to make healthcare affordable by making everyone enter the insurance pool to spread costs out evenly over the population.  

I have Ulcerative Colitis.  My main medication costs $900/month cash and I have to see a specialists 2-6 times a year (at nearly $300+ a 15 minute visit.)  I have not seen my specialist in over a year because the cost was simply too much with being in school and working just enough hours to keep my insurance.  I found out this month that my insurance has increased by co-pay on my medication from 30 dollars to $107/month.  So now I am in a position to choose between my medication and other necessities.  My hope is the ACA will make situations like this go away.  I have been relatively fortunate but working in a retail pharmacy I have seen many people who are not.  While the ACA may not be the end all be all answer to the problems with this country's health care system.. it is a start to help those most adversely affected by those problems.

(P.s. this is my first post to Reddit and my oh my it is a long one.  Thanks for reading!)

"As a liberal, just my quick two cents. I have a great deal of respect for George Will, a real conservative and a brilliant man, who would never in a million years would call a woman a ""slut"" like Limbaugh or say Obama has a ""deep seeded hatred for white people and white culture"" like Glenn Beck.

Also, William F. Buckley was a real, true conservative and an eloquent, brilliant intellectual. Now, I don't agree with many of his viewpoints on past issues, Vietnam is one example, but he was honest and thoughtful. Similar to George Will, Buckley had the ability to grasp complex issues and never, ever spewed talking points. Comparing George Will or Buckley to Hannity, Glen Beck, or Coulter is like comparing Socrates and Aristotle to drunk frat house. Unfortunately, loud bravado and arrogance has taken over for conservative dialogue rooted in an intellectual philosophy that makes a lot of sense in many cases. I never thought I'd long for the days of when Pat Buchanan or Ross Perot were big in the GOP, but I actually miss those days. May Matalin is also an example of an extremely intelligent, eloquent conservative, but nowadays a Sarah Palin type who winks at the screen or a Michelle Bachmann who ties in God to every issue represent mainstream conservatism.

Also, although I disagree with them on most things, I respect Ron Paul and Rand Paul because they at least have enough principle to buck the trend of pandering to extremists in their party. I agree entirely with Rand Pual on the drone issue.

Obama.,1
"She acts like a child.  ""Tuck me in"", sex is ""playing"", she's afraid to do anything by herself.

She is sooooo passive about everything -- as in her way of saying ""I want sex"" is laying there.  No engaging in foreplay, nope.  Sex isn't as incredibly one-sided but it still gets to me that I can't get anything without explicitly asking (Where's the sexiness in that?) and her go-to sexy move is the fish.

She is also willfully ignorant because shes 'Southern' (From Northern VA).  So for instance she'll take conservative viewpoints without understanding them simply because her family does.  She'll hate on ObamaCare right after she got a prescription under her parents' insurance as a result of the ACA.

Weird == Bad, so in other words, no openness to ideas/food/movies that fall outside of her preconceived norms.

I cope with it because she's really good to me and cooks like a genius.  It's a little straining though.  We moved in together recently and it's opened my eyes to a ton of stuff (read most of the above) -- it's kinda shitty but we're both stuck together.  I'm hopeful that things will change (because some things already have) and get better, at least there's a little less than a year to find out.

On a lighter note she's definitely partially deaf but denies the hell out of it which means that every now and then she'll throw out the biggest non-sequiter in conversation because she misheard the conversation completely.  Which is hilarious, because she'll just roll with it and the conversation will change out of the blue.",1

Obama........according to Oklahomans,1
"Aha! I did ask for a why but I answered only with a question once again. Since you did not answer mine I will try to tell you *why*.

As I have said the answer could transition into the field of religion or science and that is truly what got me thinking about these core beliefs. Beliefs give other beliefs veracity. Now philosophical talks about what is truth and whatnot are something I would be excited to get into but that is not what you asking me. Let us pretend I believe the GOP is just and completely correct (this is not the case, I assure you). I believe this because of an innumerable amount of reasons. If we're talking in the way of stereotypes I would believe the Christian God is the only just god and he is my savior. I would also believe that Obama is worthless and abortion is wrong. Now I believe these things based on other statistics and such from my party leaders. (These are generalities and in no way do I purport that all Republicans are this way.) These beliefs are maybe set around the fact that I thought my parents were infallible and always right so when they told me such things I believed them. The reason I believed them was because they had not yet led me astray and because of other, countless psychological reasons. These beliefs are like Russian nesting dolls. The main belief (I like the GOP) is backed up by a smaller belief (my parents are infallible).

From there I started thinking about why humans had such thoughts at all. Neurons, electrical signals, synapses. All very complicated and I haven't done much looking into of the brain but it is just an organized firing of electrical signals that have, through millions of years of evolution, created being so smart we now realize we exist. A crazy thought to think that we know we are.

From there I thought, why do I have beliefs at all if I am really just atoms arranged in such a particular way to create my aforementioned thoughts. This led me into philosophy and science giving me a vast pool of knowledge that I enjoyed finding.

So, I gained my two paradoxical beliefs from thinking about the human condition and how horrible it is. It is pointless but wonderful. It is horrific but interesting. I think a human life has value but there really is none. Exploring these thoughts have really made me the person I am today so truthfully, and in closing, I don't have an answer for why. I know that these two things are true since all my own pondering has pointed to them both being true at the same time so somehow, in my own mind, they solidify each other's veracity.

TL;DR I don't have an answer besides the fact that they're both true to myself.",1
"&gt;Hmmm...well I've found this mostly to be true. He's completely changed health care and ended the wars. Name a good reason why you don't like him and maybe you've got something but I honestly doubt you have something. Most of the criticism about Obama is a hidden racism. He's probably one of the best presidents we've had and it's a shame that his reputation is so messed up. Think about Bush: Torture, wars, the patriot act...I could go on and on. Obama is way better.

Only person that may be mentioned 2000 years from now is Obama just because he was the first black president. That will be more important in 2000 years than anything else,1
"are you sure about that ? 

How many prominent people can you name from 2000 years ago ?

Cleopatra, Marc Antony, Julius Caesar and Jesus Christ come to mind.

Now why is that ? Well for one, history says that this is the period when dominance transferred from Egypt to Rome. 

I'd also argue that it's largely because ""Western"" culture is currently still the dominant paradigm. 

The United States is currently the most powerful country and we of course are the bastard spawn of the British Empire... The British Empire would not have been possible without the European Enlightenment, which of course would not have been possible without the Italian Renaissance....

Now... The Italian Renaissance was largely of result of the scholarship of Greek and Arabic knowledge... 

but I suppose that since Europeans and Americans look a little more like greeks than arabians, that we tend to see look at Greek/Roman culture as ""Classic"". 

Also even though most Greek knowledge was likely derived from Egypt, and the Egyptian empire(s) seems to have absolutely dwarfed Rome in terms of time and scope...

we focus most of our attention on the glorious time when power transferred from the weird Egyptians to the more caucasian looking Romans that used an alphabet and later practiced Christianity. 

( BTW... did you know there was at least one Black Roman emperor, Severus in 193 ? )

So first, if in 2000 years the dominant culture isn't ""Western"" , then I don't care how long the United States remains prominent, it won't be seen as canonical. 

Second, even if the culture in 2000 years remains ""Western"" then the United States will have to last at long longer than 250 years and contribute ALOT more to the world for anyone to be talking about it's ""first black president"" . 

P.s Race is largely a result of genetic drift and not stagnant at all. I think there is decent chance that in only a few hundred years, that Americans may become so mixed that most people will look like Tiger Woods or Lenny Kravitz  and this ""look"" may be seen as the racially American... if this is the case then in 2000 years I doubt most people would even understand why we called Obama ""black"" and was this was important. 

Lastly, due the ability of technology to change the nature of history ( Wikipedia vs. sculpture and scrolls ) my analysis is likely worthless. 

I think Einstein and his association with the Atomic age/Bomb has the biggest chance of being remembered.  Or Maybe JFK and the moon landing...

In History, great wars seems to be remembered best of all, and a world war with the prototypically evil Hitler that ended with the Atomic frickin Bomb is pretty memorable. 

Basically, if was playing the Sims and everyday represented 10 years, I'd still sure as hell take notice when they dropped the first atomic bomb or landed on the moon.... I guess...",1

"Easy : prices are going up, not down. You can't keep your doctor since your health insurance will most likely change since it won't cover everything the government says its supposed to. Companies are lowering full time employees to 29 hours since its cheaper to pay the fine than to buy health insurance. The website does not work. Why should men and women pay the exact same amount ? Women give birth. Men do not. If there are no pre-existing conditions then ill just wait till I'm sick then ill buy health insurance. Young healthy people now have to pay more for insurance to subsidize the poor elderly. Ohamacare actually cut Medicaide. Obamacare took over the student loan industry which raieses college costs and now your interests on your loans are paying for Obamacare. Do I need to continue ?

Obamacare?,0
"Obama is not a great president, but he is nowhere near the worst.  I think history will label him as mediocre at best.  His two biggest problems were that he was WAY overhyped, and that the GOP spend WAY too much time trying to make him look bad.  Some Republicans even admitted that their NUMBER ONE PRIORITY was to make Obama a one-term president.  Their number one priority was not jobs, or the economy, or foreign policy, or whatever, but to make Obama look bad.  They actually publicly admitted that.

Obama's mediocrity and barely left-of-center leanings for some bizarre reason were seen as uber-liberal Muslim-loving socialism, which caused the GOP to respond and overcorrect with uber-conservative Jesus-loving capitalism, which of course cost them the 2012 election.  If they had stayed more toward the middle-of-the-road, and pandered to broader Conservative ideology and center-leaning Democrats (for example, me), we'd have a Republican president now.

Honestly, I have never understood all the Obama hate.  I mean, I didn't vote for the guy in 2008 or 2012, and as I've already said, I think he's a mediocre-at-best president.  But instead of letting Obama do four years as a caretaker president whose only legacy will probably be ""the first black president,"" Republicans and Conservatives decided to go crazy and wage an all-out political war on the guy, putting us in the mess we're in today.
