"&gt; gratification outside of the marriage.

This is, by definition, cheating. Saying that she ""should come to terms with it"" is also assuming that she *would* be okay with it, when OP hasn't even talked to her about a situation such as an open marriage.

&gt; If someone doesn't feel the need to be possessive of their partner's sexuality, why wouldn't they accept the other person having sex with someone else?

Possessiveness of sexuality (or lack thereof) doesn't make it okay to have sex with someone else [unless OP's wife gives her consent]. Asexuality also does not excuse cheating or assuming that they would be ""okay"" with his/her partner having sex with someone else.

Asexuals may not be sexually attracted to other people, but that doesn't mean we don't *care* about our partner being in a ""mutually exclusive sexual relationship"".

&gt; Entitlement? So do you think you are entitled to control the other person's sexuality then?

No, I don't, and what you quoted was me expressing that sentiment. 

&gt; If they enter into the relationship aware of the other person being asexual and with the explicit understanding that it's an exclusive relationship they'd carry the responsibility for the choice. They'd choose to enter into a sexless relationship.

A relationship between a sexual and an asexual doesn't mean it's a ""sexless"" one. Asexuals aren't born without plumbing or genitalia, you know. We're just as capable of having (or even enjoying) sex and having babies as anyone else, as pleasure from sex is not equivalent to sexual attraction. 

Many asexuals simply don't choose to have sex because sexual attraction is lacking, and sexual attraction is a huge motivating factor when it comes to people wanting to have sex. We may see that a person is aesthetically attractive, like a work of fine art, but there's no drive to have sex with that person. 

In my case, I chose to stop having sex for several other reasons as well: excruciating pain during sex, and my partner caring more about his own pleasure than the fact he was hurting me; bleeding and tearing due to large penis size, resulting in multiple UTIs and other infections; not feeling aroused or 'in the mood'; and more. (And why would I be? I was biting down on pillows, trying not to cry, every time I had sex.) 

Even despite seeing a doctor, there was no apparent biological cause of these problems. It was ""just how I was born"". I eventually realized that it's mainly because I'm just not sexually attracted to people; sex was not enjoyable for me.

&gt; In either case, if the more sexual partner needs to have sex that badly they may well be better off breaking up, but that's a bit beside the point.

Agreed.

&gt; Anyway, I think generally speaking it's better to make compromises than to accept either extreme as the only correct view.

I also agree here. As long as sex for the wife isn't painful, I think she should definitely consider having sex with her husband. There are plenty of other asexual people married to sexuals who do this. Sex can also be pleasurable, if you know how to stimulate the genitalia and do it right. ",1

"Depends what we mean by the term. Within our lifetimes (as in, by about 2070-2100), I think we might conceivably see a state of affairs in which there are no international conflicts taking place.

The world of 2100 will be almost unrecognisable to us, and I'm inclined to think somewhat optimistically about it. After all, in just 70 years Europe managed go from the bloodiest warzone in history to pretty much the way it is now, with war between the EU states absolutely unthinkable. Even the former Yugoslavian states are gradually working things out as the memories of the wars there begin to fade. Indeed, if you were to ask a person from between 1953 and 1962 what they would think of our chances of ending the Cold War as peacefully as really happened, I doubt they'd be at all optimistic.

Looking to the present: there are currently a grand total of about 52 armed conflicts currently ongoing according to Wikipedia. Possibly slightly fewer, depending on which conflicts we consider separate from one another. The most active at the moment is of course the Syrian Civil War/ISIS Conflict, with about 160,000 deaths since January 2014.

Of course, low-level insurgency might well continue long after such an achievement, and crimes like murder will always be with us for as long as humans are recognisably human. So if we require *those* to also be gone before we can declare world peace, we might have to wait a lot longer.",10

He shit on everyone else, supply, maintenance, IT, other companies, etc.  Yo dude! You might not have to deal with them and ask for help, but us enlisted sure have to.

It got to the point where my sergeant in charge (the captain is his boss),  asked us to go hang out with the captain here and there because he felt that we didn't like him.  We didn't. He made our lives so much harder for no reason other than self gratification.

Our unit was stationed in Kuwait and doing stuff in Iraq.  My section leader decided during the daily battalion briefings, he was going to mock the senior ranking people (first sergeants, company commanders, etc) in the briefing who were going with their Soldiers into Iraq. If you spend 30 days you get an extra medal to wear. While most the lower enlisted made it well past that, most the senior ranking members wouldn't hit 30 days.  That got a lot of people upset with us until they realized we enjoyed him mocking them as much as they did.

"Do both. I got an engineering degree, will be getting an engineering masters, and plan to go to med school after that. My grades aren't as amazing as someone in an easier major, but they aren't that terrible for a med school applicant and I know coming from an engineering background will itself be a boost. After med school, I can be a regular doctor or I can do stuff like work at a pharmaceutical company (chemical engineer) or help design prosthetics (more mechanical, but close enough). There's even opportunities for stuff on Wall Street. Companies and their products need to be evaluated to know if they're good investments. Who can evaluate a bio-tech company better than an Engineer+MD?

And, if I for some reason leave med school or don't even get in, then I have a perfectly respectable engineering degree to fall back on like he mentioned above with business degree. Engineering already requires the calc, physics, chem, and a few writing credits so the only extra stuff really needed is the bio and orgo. My degree was a chemical and bio engineering one so it actually covered a lot of the pre-med requirements itself. But I know some MechE's who are pre-med and are doing just fine. As long as you plan it all out, it's really not too terrible.

Also, if you're worried about getting into specific schools, don't be. As long as you go to a school in the US (and preferrably an allopathic (MD) school and not osteopathic (DO)), you'll be fine. When applying for residencies, the most important part of your CV is your Board exams, Step 1 and 2 (there's also a Step 3 but I think you usually take this after having already matched to a residency program). Obviously, a graduate from a good school will always be preferred, but a much stronger preference is placed on how well you do on your Boards, which are national exams so you have the same opportunity as everyone else to do well.",2

My counselor has established with me over and over that I don't give myself enough credit for what I *do* bring to the table (instead I beat myself up for what I don't bring) and the way I deal with it is by receding from social-view.

He warns that this is can be dangerous spiral if I get too caught up in it, but it is really fucking difficult to consider myself worthy of those social interactions when I'm feeling down about myself.

"Well I found out that a this kid, I'll call him Chad, was gonna ask the girl I had a crush on to prom... tomorrow in 5th period.  I wasn't planning to go to prom but Chad has never talked to the girl and if someone didn't stop it both would of been extremely embarrassed(he was gonna do it in one of her classes) and I probably would of gotten some backlash.  

After homeroom I was able to let her know about it and then she wanted to skip that class, but I believe they had a test that day so she wouldn't of been able to.  Even the teacher of that class let me let me know that Chad was gonna ask her in that class.  I then decided that I had to ask her before 5th period.  One kid in my class almost got me to use the intercom to ask her.  

Since things in high school spread like wildfire, everybody knew about the situation by 3rd period, including Chad.  Needless to say he was furious at me.  Thankfully I got the teacher to explain to him that it was gonna be embarrassing for both of them and that she was not going to say yes.  

It does not seem like a lot happened but pretty much all of this was done with me running around during the 5 minutes between each period, and I had a total of 25 minutes to do all of this work.  If everyone's phone number was public this situation could have been pretty simple, but then it is a loss of privacy and would definitely be abused by bullies.

**TL;DR:** A kid was gonna ask the girl I had a crush on to prom during class and I had only 5, 5 minute long, in-between period sessions to stop him from doing it.  ",1

"Actually, Florida's state universities are some of the more affordable ones in the country. The University of Florida charges $212 per credit hour for an education that's ranked around the mid-40s nationally (that's including public and private schools), which is a pretty good deal compared to other universities of similar prestige. At the standard 30 credit hours/year, that comes out to $6360 per year, compared to the national average of over $9000 [according to College Board](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/college-costs/college-costs-faqs). FSU isn't as well regarded as UF, but it's still a good education for a reasonable price.

And the state provides Bright Futures scholarships to any high school student who graduates with a GPA above 3.0 (which is not super hard given the way the state weights honors and AP classes), a 1270 SAT score, and 200 community service hours (which you have 4 years to rack up). I know tons of kids who went to FSU and not one of their families had to mortgage their house. It could be managed with a part time job.",19

"I can’t believe that nobody in this thread pointed out that celebrating the Wehrmacht or SS is (to some extent) considered a crime in Germany and Austria because it equates to celebrating one of the most horrifying and singularly evil events in the history of humankind (the wish and action to kill all people of one group with industrial means). It is not OK and extremely dubious to celebrate Wehrmacht/SS-Veterans and in general, it is not done, only by Nazis and Neonazis and the extreme right (which is still a big percentage of the populace). When people find out that renowned men were in the SS or Wehrmacht (such as author Günter Grass or former UNO secretary Kurt Waldheim) it is, rightly, a BIG scandal. There is always some controversy over whether people even had a choice whether to join the Wehrmacht or not, but this argument is often used to downplay the horrifying history. In Germany and Austria, after the war, there were (not enough, though) efforts to de-nazify society by firing active supporters and reeducating the people. It all is in no way comparable to the idea(lizarion) of US-veteranism. Rightly celebrated are people in the Widerstand, the Allied Forces and Partisans who fought AGAINST the Wehrmacht and SS. 

This is one of the most shocking reddit threads I've ever seen. I expect a lot of downvotes on this according to what was posted here. (And I know that saying that usually is a self-fulfilling prophecy.) But… I don't know. I'm just speechless.",7

The fact is that how good a school is considered directly corresponds to how White it is. I hate with a passion the whole idea of the suburbs.

Why should we have to flee the cities we created for the security of the suburbs? Why are the suburbs secure in the first place? Because they are White. The pathetic part is that these White people dont even admit to themselves why they are moving. They tell themselves it is for better schools or simply to live in a nicer neighborhood.

"on the same note, i convinced my ex that i was a werewolf, she wasn't the smartest girl, and I've had some practice at tricking her so i knew how to pull it off.

""ooo cant go shopping i gotta spend tonight greasing the chains for the lockdown"".  i got the idea after i saw the episode of the office where jim convinces dwight hes a vampire.

EDIT:  How i did it?  I began by leaving clues, scared of the moon, i never touched silver etc.  but my favorite part was i watched her dog for a few weeks and i trained her to do various things non-verbally  (she was a very good dog and extremely easy to train).  I could stare and make her sit, a stare and slight point would make her lie down and etc etc. so when i did this in front of her shed think I'm talking to the dog.  She also told me that she believed in warewolfs, ghosts, and vampires so i knew i only had to convince her that i was a werewolf, not that they exist.  Eventually after i gave her enough ""signs"" i told her straight up im a werewolf and i was ashamed of it,  the whole time i was trying my damnedest not to laugh because she was buying it hook line and sinker.  the best way to tell an good lie is to act like you don't want them to know.  Of course she asked to see my wolf form (haha still fucking hilarious to say that) and i told her it was too dangerous.

BUT the real challenge was whatever fell out of the jar, someone in the group had to eat. Luckily only one mealworm fell out of the jar. The actor in the maze had each of us pick a number between 1 and 100 and the closest to what he was thinking had to eat the worm and it just so happened to be me. They forced me to eat the meal worm. When we exited the maze, my friend who had to reach into the jar offered me a bunch mentos as an apology.  ",1

This is only my experience but the Europeans I've met usually seem very neutered. They tend to be pessimistic and accept defeat easily. At least compared to a lot of Americans.

"This actually did happen to a real person, and the real person is me. I had gone to catch a train. This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I’d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of cookies. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It’s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here’s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of cookies. There’s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn’t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of cookies, tore it open, took one out, and ate it.

Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There’s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your cookies. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know… But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do aclue in the newspaper, couldn’t do anything, and thought, What am I going to do?

In the end I thought Nothing for it, I’ll just have to go for it, and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a cookie for myself. I thought, That settled him. But it hadn’t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another cookie. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice…” I mean, it doesn’t really work.

We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight cookies, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and st back.

A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my cookies. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who’s had the same exact story, only he doesn’t have the punch line.

"I absolutely don't understand how people could dislike Lima beans.  But I am not going to give someone a hard time for not liking Lima beans and I am not going to try to make some eat Lima beans if they don't want them.  

You started by saying that it is just tickling and that isn't a big deal.  My poi t is that unwelcome tickling is a big deal for some people and that we should tickle those people after we know that it is a big deal.  If you want to tickle your girlfriend, that's cool.  You both like it.  But it isn't okay to tickle someone that has a real problem with it and you don't get to decide whether it is a problem for someone else.
""Tickling like a normal person"" is 100% okay for the people that it is okay for.  If you find out that it isn't okay for someone, then don't fucking do it.  That's not hard to understand.

I like back rubs.  I am a complete backrub slut.  If Donald Trump came up to me and started giving me a back rub, I would let him and I hate Donald Trump.  Hell, if Donald Trump gave me a back rub, I might even vote for him.  I can't understand why anyone would find a backrub unwelcome.  But if someone else doesn't want a backrub, then I'm not going to rub their back and I am not going to try to convince them that they are wrong to dislike backrubs. 

This really isn't at all hard to figure out.  If someone doesn't want a particular kind of physical touch, then don't fucking do it.  Even if you think it is ""normal"" and you think everyone should like it.  ",2

"Oh yeah of course, my wife and I got huge bundles of baby clothes from someone for 20 quid which we used for our son and then moved on to other people when he outgrew them, instead of spending the same amount on just one outfit. It makes good sense. But we definitely needed the hand me downs because of financial difficulty, that was the main reason for it. My half brother is 7 years older than me too, which thinking about it would probably have meant a lot of stuff was hanging around for a while waiting to be passed on to me (I was a chubby kid so I guess I could fit into the same clothes a bit earlier than he did...) but I wouldn't be surprised if they were actually buying some of the stuff for me too.",3

"Elementary School: Daniel

Daniel did not understand the difference between good attention and bad attention. He would eat boogers and put stuff in his nose to get a reaction out of people. This continued through 6th grade. If a teacher chastised him for talking or something like that he would have a meltdown and run his head in the wall or desk or something hard while shouting Stupid! Stupid!


High School: Phillip

Phillip bleached his hair about 4 years after that trend already died out. He wore a cape to school every day.

"I waited two years for the love of my life to realize things weren't going to work out with his ex wife (she had left him a few months before I met him) but he was convinced he had to make it work out.... not to say that I didn't date while I was waiting, but no one ever ever compared to him. I remained his best friend and eventually he realized he didn't like me dating. Good things come to those who wait! That was almost 5 years ago. We now have two beautiful baby boys together and we are getting married next month :) ",1

The thing is, only time can help. Hold on to the good memories and remember the lessons he taught you. As long as you keep him in your heart and thoughts he will never be far away.

I think part of the large number of people having disorders is due to how very big America is. We have a tremendous population. It's not terribly surprising that we also have a large population of people with disorders. ,1
