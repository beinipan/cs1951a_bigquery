"I think I can add my lifelong experiences to this. I am from a very low caste - scheduled caste. I am 32 years old and have lived one fourth of my life in North America. Let me explain first what being SC means in India.




First, and most important when you meet someone and they ask your last name, you know they will know your caste and you can feel their judging eyes in your bones and you can’t do shit. 32 years and it still makes me nervous to mention someone my last name and my last name doesn’t even give away my caste. However, just because my family name doesn’t give away my caste they just ask it and I can see their silent judgement. Oh and if any of you think it could be my psychological issue, No it’s not; everyone I know from my caste and other lower castes, feel the same way. 




Everyone in my family has either Masters from western universities or PhD from very reputed Indian universities and are in very good professional positions and still we are often discriminated against. We can’t buy or rent houses / apartments in most of the residential colonies. And, this is in Ahmedabad, the place where our honorable prime minister used to contend for his state legislative assembly. Most of our relatives who bought or rented apartments / houses in last 2-3 years were asked by the builders what caste they belong to and upon finding that they belong to lower cast were denied housing. Builders don’t have problems selling houses or apartments but they fear one or two lower caste family will alienate other upper caste families from their colonies and will lower the market price.




Oh and police behavior is more or less same as USA police has towards black community (Assumption on my part so no offence to USA police members).




And marriage is a whole lot different thing. My brother married to a Brahmin girl. He had to spend more than two years to convenience the girl’s parents to allow him to get married to their daughter. Now in normal Indian marriage scenario, he shouldn’t have any problem since he’s highly educated, very well earning and a very handsome young man and as per Indian arranged marriage scenario he’s a catch. And, he still was not allowed in her home for more than two years even though he was dating her for over five years and she was treated as a family member in our house.




And most important, I and most of my family members were asked what caste we belong to In Delhi and Mumbai Airports, In Toronto India Community, In NewYork Indian Community. The very first time I went to Toronto the first person I meet from my state Gujarat was a Patel and first thing he asked me was what caste I belong to.





I agree that we don’t have much caste issue in big cities on general level such as sharing food or getting promotion but you know that subtle discrimination, that silent judging, that constant need to prove yourself because you’re from lower caste, that facial expression of higher caste people when they find your caste, etc. are some of the things can never leave you with peace. I think India needs another 100 or may be more years to completely remove caste. And I can understand that, I mean India just got free 68 years ago, it’s still a very young country. Look at USA, how many years they took to accept black, How many years they took to elect a black president and do they yet have a female president?




I am tired and didn’t read much of what I wrote so if my English doesn’t make sense or if my thoughts aren’t put on here clearly, please accept my sincerest apologizes, I’ll try to clarify / correct it tomorrow. I am off to bed.

If we can somehow discover the biological root of mental disorders, it's *possible* that it will become more likely we'll have surgeries instead of counseling, but even if we determine the biological causes, we'll still need psychiatrists.

To put it simply, diagnosing the biological cause may be helpful, but it will *still* come down to interpretation, unless we start subscribing to hard determinism, and even if diagnosed, the information may not be helpful. More importantly, as brains are fundamentally fluid in structure, it's going to be difficult to argue that a patient should receive a diagnosis based on structure alone, without removing culpability for one's actions entirely *outside* patient care scenarios...

As I mentioned, there are just so many factors, and probably the most haunting for me was the possibility/fact that I was manipulated and controlled and lied to. It wasn't always so controlling, but towards the end it was. The first few years I was ignorant and thought i was in love when really he was manipulative and did it to other girls, often at the same time. 

I just struggle with the fact that he manipulated me. I feel stupid and dumb. I am happy with my appearance, most people will mention that I dress well and have a great figure, I'd like to think I'm fairly intelligent and I am also known for my strong personality. I am extremely confident and always stand up for myself and others. So I'm just embarrassed that I was manipulated for so long and got stuck in a shitty relationship. It just goes completely against my character. 

So I guess I'm just trying to explain that you don't really need to try and figure out how on earth it makes any sense or what she saw in him etc etc. It will never make sense. My scenario, will never make any sense to me at all either. For as long as I shall live. Im deeply ashamed and embarrassed but if he came up to me in the street, i would have to tell my partner because thats what my partner would expect me to do - we are that type of couple that are meant to be informing each other of that kind of thing if the situation should arise.

"Okay. Well I'll tell you what I do :)

Keep in mind I am a 21 year old female.

So each morning I wake up, the first thing I do is go in the hot shower. First I use bodywash and wash my body using a washcloth. (Honestly I like Axe, don't judge)

Then I have this glove thing, its like a scrubber. It looks like [this](http://a5.files.imabeautygeek.com/image/upload/c_fit,cs_srgb,dpr_1.0,q_80,w_620/MTI2NTQ5NTg0MTIwOTE2NjEx.jpg)

I use it with [Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash](http://www.target.com/p/neutrogena-oil-free-acne-wash-pink-grapefruit-foaming-scrub/-/A-11537187?ref=tgt_adv_XSG10001&amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;LNM=11537187&amp;CPNG=Health+Beauty&amp;kpid=11537187&amp;LID=17pgs&amp;ci_src=17588969&amp;ci_sku=11537187&amp;kpid=11537187&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjw1pWrBRDuv-rhstiX6KwBEiQA5V9Zoa_ww2MbMWfKhKMNUQnJAVo-zvlYK3UjPnn1whu6UgAaAk5D8P8HAQ) I like the grapefruit kind but the green or orange one works too.

Then I wash my hair with basically any shampoo, I use random ones.

Then I leave the shower and put [Neutrogena Astringent](http://cdn1.viewpoints.com/pro-product-photos/000/025/277/300/1285857468-89923_full.jpg) on my face with a cotton ball. And then swap my ears with Q Tips.

Then after my face dries for a few minutes I put another [Neutrogena Cream](http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/16553/220.jpg) on my face. Then deoderant (I use both stick and then the spray)

Then I get dressed. Make my hair look nice (I have short hair so it's easy to take care of) then I brush my teeth before I leave for work!",1

"Used to have a tv with satellite service hooked up on the second floor of our house (near my bedroom). After a month of having this luxury, my mom told my stepdad to disconnect it because she ""missed seeing me."" She wanted me to spend more time with them downstairs. I'd pretty much come home from school, sit upstairs with Cartoon Network on watching the Toonami line up and do my homework. I was annoyed because the only other tv with satellite in our house was in my parent's room, and my stepdad constantly had that tuned to something he wouldn't even be watching... but he'd be listening to it, so damned be us all if anyone changed the channel. 

The tv upstairs still stayed there, and there was a vcr hooked up (I eventually got a dvd/vcr combo... woohoo!), so I could still watch movies upstairs. Mom felt satisfied that I couldn't watch regular tv line ups though because somehow that made me spend more time with her? 

I also eventually got a small tv in my room (hooked up to my awesome dvd/vcr combo!), so I spent more time in my room still watching the same movies over and over. We got a tv for the living room, and Dad moved a small tv to the kitchen table so he could actually watch tv from the kitchen instead of listening to it from the bedroom... although he usually left both running... on different channels... at the same volume of overbearingly loud because he was partially deaf... so, watching tv in the living room (which was four feet from the kitchen and my parents' bedroom with no walls dividing the kitchen and living room) was a chance to hone my skills of selective hearing. The training worked so well, I soon had this super power to never hear my parents when they tried talking to me. ",2

Speed isn't always the problem, driver education is. We could probably quite happily raise the speed limits on our highways and freeways if people actually paid attention to their surroundings, were aware of what cars and other drivers and hazards were near them and actually looked further in front of them than the nose of their car. 

Unfortunately we get our licences on the bare minimum of requirements and we then wonder why we have so many accidents. 

I believe that if we were taught how to truly handle a vehicle, not just the basics but what to do when your car spins out of control at high speeds, how to take a corner safely at high speeds, how to brake suddenly and safely then we could raise the speeds. 

I'll get downvoted for this because ""think of the children"". Let me be clear I'm only suggesting highways, freeways and similar roads where we are already doing 100kms.

If we could be certain of an individual's guilt then I have no great objection to the death penalty.

Many people are convicted merely because they are considered to be mostly likely to be guilty, rather than because they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  For this reason, the death penalty becomes a highly suspect policy.  One innocent person put to death by the State is too many.

There is also the question of - 'should the State ever be allowed the power of life and death over the citizens?'  This is a slippery slope that could justify assassination, and bypassing the entire criminal justice system.",2

"My story(and I realize I derped and forgot to include a ""/surprise regular party"" snippet in the headline, sorry! Any kind of party and/or surprise experience will do!

Anyway, my story: 

I was attending my late aunt Lucille's bday party (alive at the time, obviously :D ) and it was intended to be a sort of ""surprise, we all love and appreciate you so much"" party.

Backstory: her husband, my uncle Danny had gone in for a routine surgery ( I forgot, but it was totally minor, something really simple), and they didn't give him enough oxygen during surgery so he got Alzheimer's... At least that's how I understand it. *edit to add the party was because her husband had passed, and we all wanted to recognize how hard she'd worked to make his last days as peaceful as possible as she loved him very much.

Also, I should mention that that side of the family is all Jehovah's Witnesses. Religious beliefs aside, I can say they are all such genuinely sweet and decent human beings, and I love them.

ANYWAY.

The party. Myself, my sister, her husband and kids attend the party. My cousins, Danny, Jessica, and Danielle, are there as well as a bunch of other relatives. Initially, neither me, nor my sister/fam knew about the ""surprise"" status. We thought we were going to a random Jehovah's Witness side of the family barbecue.

We get there, and Danny, the oldest cousin I reference, takes a second to give my Aunt Lucille a card, ""just because"".

Because remember, to her, it's just a get together, regular (they did this all the time). but it's really a surprise (and also we didn't know).

So, she's like ""OH MY GOSH! What an amazing grandson, look at what Danny did!"" 

To everyone. For like an hour. And all the cousins just looked at him like, ""You fucker.""

They couldn't out him without ruining the surprise! So he just got to be her SHINING fucking grandchild for just over one hour hahahaa.

His mother was at the counter ordering their sandwiches and the kid is just spinning in circles looking up at the ceiling when he stops and goes ""*uh-ohhhhh*.""

He takes down his pants all the way to the ankles, squats, and just lets fly a wretched load of ass candy right there on the floor.  His mother pays for their food, turns towards the soda fountain to fill their drinks up, and actually just calmly steps over the pile of shit to get their drinks.

She takes her son's hand and they walk out.  She never once acknowledges the fact that her human son just took a shit on the floor of a restaurant full of people.

All the customers are enraptured by what we've just witnessed and nobody is sure what to do.  It's dead silent as we all kind of look around at each other, then to the heap of festering shit, then to the employees behind the counter.

"I drive a pretty decent stretch of back roads between my home and my University quite frequently. It's like an hour and a half of nothing but farms and trees. Late at night, on a particularly desolate stretch of road, I noticed some flickering lights way ahead of me. As I sped closer, the lights grew more intense until it was a pretty bright glowing. When I was close enough to see what was going on, I saw a bunch of cars and trucks parked off to the side of the road and a huge fire burning in the trees about 30 meters from the road. I stopped, checking out the amazing bonfire. The stack of trees and logs was like ten or fifteen feet high and the flames were easily double that. The fire was so bright that it was hard to look at for longer than a couple seconds, but I could see people moving around just inside the trees. They were packing up chairs and tents and running back and forth between their camp and vehicals, obviously bailing. A mammoth of a man got out of one of the trucks and started waving his hands at me. I tensed up, wondering if I had stumbled upon the wrong kind of party, but the guy just told me it would best to move on as the fire was likely to spread. I realized that the fire had probably started out much smaller and burned out of control. Later that week, on my way back, a huge swath of the woods had burned down. There were still fire and rescue milling around, but it looked as if the flames were all the way out. I still don't know if the people I had seen were caught or owned up to starting a forrest fire. Luckily it hadn't spread for more than a few hundred square feet before it was extinguished.",37

My dad woke up and sharply turned the wheel to the right, so our car swerved across the road toward the trees on the right hand side.  While my dad tried to regain control of the car, we literally snaked back and forth across the highway a few times.  Finally, my dad got the car back to normal.

I'm too inexperienced to fix this, and not emotionally strong enough or emotionally detached to force her to do it. It has literally broken my family. My dad is obese almost directly because of it, my family hardly eats healthy anymore, i just refuse to eat what they try and give me, my brother has obtained some form of mental illness I don't know of, basically anger issues, and it gets worse over time. I hear you man, and that might just be what I have to do, but its going to be a fucking nightmare.

"Not often at all. Usually we don't start suggesting a lot of work until a lot of work is actually needed.

If I notice your air filter is particularly dirty, I'm going to suggest one. If I noticed you were belts are worn, frayed, or broken I will suggest new ones. 

Diagnostics have become more and more accurate over the years, with the help of other technology, but sometimes it's still a guessing game. We will give you the best guess for the proper Repair for your vehicle based on the symptoms it is displaying. Sometimes we get it wrong, and will have to move on to the next method.

Sometimes, people will bring in vehicles needing something they weren't even aware of, and when we suggest repairs, we are usually more than happy to show them exactly what we mean. ",2

"It's south Mississippi. The fact she was black is almost paramount. 

Unless you're cookie-cutter white boy, you're going to have problems with the law. Dark skin, visible tattoos, a beard, or long hair, is a good way to get pulled over and harassed. 

Chances are they pulled her over and found a bit of weed, which despite being decriminalized in the state, the cops will do everything in their power to fuck you, including jail time, revoked license, sometimes forfeiture of your vehicle. 

Meanwhile real crimes go uninvestigated and unpunished because the cops don't want to venture into the rough areas, like the ""Butterbean Flats"" or Palmer's Crossing (an area mentioned in the song ""Mississippi"" by Afroman). They stick to the safe and rich neighborhoods, or around the college, bothering students with a bit of weed or an open container (which isn't illegal either).

I can't say I blame them, because those neighborhoods are rough, but then again I'm just a civilian. I don't have 50 brothers, an arsenal, or impunity. Or access to massively discounted armor.


The weirdest thing is though, is this outward blatant racism is only present in the police. Average normal sane people don't act like that. Races have to coexist and get along. Give someone an out, an excuse, or power, and they go fucking nuts. Or perhaps the police just attract people that want to abuse others. It's hard to say, since despite being armed to the teeth, the police only ever fuck with the easy targets, and never delve into the hood to really ""crack down"".",11

"U.S. - California PoliSci major + law school here. Any dream of ""making big bucks"", throw that shit out the window. It won't happen. The market is flooded. If you do get a 150k job, you'll be pulling 80 hour weeks in corporate big law. If you have family lawyers, okay, that's good. You'll have work. If not, you better start making connections like a motherfucker now. Work in a law firm the summer before college. During college, intern at a law firm. After college, spend a year as a legal assistant, maybe two, at a firm where you could see yourself working after law school. Then go to law school, and kiss your social life and sanity goodbye.

"The big bad was a cult which worshiped their leader as a demigod. He had discovered ancient magics which could use human souls as a powerful source of magic, particularly to create artifacts. The more misery the soul was in before its death, the more powerful the magic that comes form destroying it.

The players infiltrated a city which had recently been converted b the cult, and they found a small prison that had been built to house the poor and the criminals. They were kept in a single small hut with no ventilation - only from the cracks around the door. They were given no food or water and slept in their own filth - and there was a revolving door of new people. The result was there were a hundred people who were sitting in a pile of shit a foot and a half thick.

Anyway, in a daring maneuver the PC's manage to pull up their very large wagon (driven by three very intelligent magic camels, one of which was succumbing to vampirism) to the single door and dispatch the guards, and begin loading up the people inside. Unfortunately more guards come, having heard the commotion.

They draw the guards into the shithouse to fight in a more confined area, since most are of the sneakier type. Once the guards dash in, most of the party blocks the doorway.

One of the characters is a Dryad Sorceror who has been cursed so the only spells she is able to cast with any real success are associated with fire. She decides to use her favorite spell, which causes a large explosion... while standing in a building with close to no ventilation that is covered in shit and its fumes. Which is quite flammable.

I pause the action to do some math and confer with the PhD candidate in the room. We conclude that they kill all the guards, about forty of the innocents they hadn't evacuated yet, cause a pretty impressive fireball and a very loud thud that the entire city hears, the halfling gets launched into the back of their wagon suffering permanent deafness, the rogue who was in the back of the room for a flank dies pretty close to instantly, and now they have to try and flee from a massive city (which they are in the heart of) on a huge wagon which is partially on fire.",1

Same with the night manager, who although I do not like, his boss didn't help prepare him for the interview to being the assistant manager and ended up looking hugely underqualified for even his current position by the regional who interviewed him.",1
"Actually getting religion out of the way seems like a sensible thing for some people.  There are lots of Christians that refuse to date non-christians, and I have no problem with that.  I am an atheist that would not be willing to date a theist.",1

"Also circumcised at about that age... I feel your pain. My condition was related to my foreskin not growing as quickly as the rest of my bits, it literally couldn't go over the flesh without tearing and I couldn't clean my penis and erections were extremely painful, from the time I seen a specialist till I went into surgery was less then two weeks. 

I wouldn't wish that agony on my worst enemy and as a result I had my son circumcised at two weeks old because the doctors refused to do it at birth. My GP said my condition could be genetic as my father and his father were both circumcised at birth due to foreskin problems in my paternal grandfathers side of the family, I too should have been circumcised at a young age but they refused and I had to get it done just prior to my teens.

I am mentally scared from the pain I suffered from the operation and if I have any more make children they will be circumcised as soon as I am able too get it done.",1
"Thanks for the civil response. 

Yeah that's a good point, electric is a great option for most civilian applications, but gas definitely will have a place long after electric cars become the norm ",3
