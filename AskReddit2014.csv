"Obamacare is shit. The plans cost more and cover less for the most part, the only people benefiting are insurance companies.

My preference would to have it be state run, however I think the Federal government should pass a basis of the minimums it should cover and that anyone can get it regardless of health. 

Personally I do not trust the Federal Government to administer my health care in any way shape or form. There is a good reason the military contracts it out to several other companies who run it phenomenally. (Except here in Florida for some god forsaken reason it's run through Humana.)",11

"In theory, sure. All arms treaties are about reducing the amount or capability of weapons. 

However, the problem with the ""throw our guns into the ocean"" approach is: each player has a rational incentive to withhold and mislead about the amount and capabilities of their weapons. Nation 2 throws all their guns in the ocean while Nation 1 (or vice versa) secretly keeps some guns and now Nation 1 has a strategic advantage over Nation 2. Each player screens information thinking they are going to get the better of the other country.  

This is one of main problems with international agreements in general. Two nations cannot enter into binding agreements because of the rational incentive to cheat the agreement. That is why you need a third party enforcement mechanism: the United States or another international institution that can enforce compliance. 

But as we know now, many nations are reluctant to have any nation or international institution serve as a third party enforcement mechanism because each signatory thinks the third party favors the other side (whether it is correct or not, it doesn't matter). 

Think of Israel-Palestine. Israel would gladly enter into an arrangement with the United States serving as a third party enforcement mechanism (this has somewhat changed because of some Obama statements on settlements) while Palestine would have basically said ""fuck that."" This is because Hamas is on a shit load of terrorist organization designations by the United States and pretty much all US allies. Likewise, Israel would never let the UN be the main third party because of the influence on anti-Israel sentiment on a number of committees and the general flame wars that start every year at the UN general assembly (it seems like every year Iran goes on stage and says the Holocaust didn't happen or threatens Israel).

Sorry for the long winded answer. ",1

But after lawsuits they don't do anything like this anymore (and are afraid of even claims as courts go against them more than not) and have many systems in place to stop it or report it. 

I worked at Wal-Mart from 2004-2011 so I can tell you truthfully. I stayed objective about them, I will call out their shit when needed and defend them where they deserve (which there are a few). They have every system in place to report retaliation stuff from management, every employee has easy access to district, regional and corporate level management to report this kind of stuff, and I never once saw people working without getting paid. Now were they given unrealistic expectations to complete in 40 hours a week, yes but that seems to be corporate America's model in general to bleed people for as much as possible. The one thing I noticed towards the last few years was cutting jobs. I saw the supercenter I worked at which was the busiest in the state go from 500+ employees to under 300, this was in direct response to Obamacare I do believe, it lead to less coverage in departments around the stores and fewer people covering more area. However stats would show the whole country was doing this. 

I know it was anecdotal but much of people's perception is from thing a very long time ago, if we are going to talk about the problems let's talk about current problems and to be fair let's hold the greater corporate landscape accountable for things like wages because it is far from a singular problem, in fact in 2004 I had just graduated high school and had a little work experience and was offered a few low skill jobs and Wal-Mart was the best wages by nearly a dollar an hour (this is before the minimum wage raised a few bucks an hour a few years back).

* How do republicans screw a lightbulb? They blame Obama for not having done it already and won't allow Obama to touch the lightbulb simultaneously. (*Any of Obama's promises the republican's voted against yet bring up in their criticism of Obama*)

* Why did the republicans vote to invade another country? Because they don't want any immigrants. (*Middle East and Mexican immigrants*)

* Why do the republicans want to keep marijuana criminalized? So they don't have to pay taxes. (*Drug policy and anti-government sentiments + political hypocrisy*)

* Why was the republican pissed at the atheist and the muslim? Because they reject Christian institutions such as Catholicism. (*hypocrisy regarding religions*)

This is how 48 states do things. In Nebraska and Maine, they vote by congressional district instead of statewide. In fact, in the 2008 election, Obama won a congressional district in Nebraska. So 4 of the state's electoral votes were McCain people, and one was an Obama guy.

If the bat shit stuff is limited to Obama, then it will be seen as racially motivated but if it continues as the status quo for the republicans than it will likely be the beginning of the end of the republican party.

One important aspect of how history will see the president is what happens after they leave office both in what they do or how the world works out. Nixon reformed his image with both. He became an elder statesman of sorts and a lot of what he did bore fruits. Clinton, Bush Sr. and Carter all went to work with charities after they left office. It is difficult to say how history will see Obama without seeing the world post Obama.",-4

YOu don't know what you're talking about. In fact Iran repeatedly offered compromises that the US rejected.

The last example: The Turks and Brazilians acted as intermediaries and suggested that Iran ship out its enriched uranium to Turkey, in return for nuclear fuel. Iran said yes. The Obama administration killed the deal, AFTER Iran agreed. The Turks and Brazilians were so pissed at the US for pulling the rug out from under them, that they publicized the letter that Obama had written to them, endorsing the SAME terms of the deal. http://www.todayszaman.com/news-211443-brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal.html

"What makes you think those specific actors are pulling strings? 

Aside from that, and assigning single causes, it's not implausible. A worldwide surveillance net is a massive boon for any economic power to have, and given the already shady ethics involved, and the murky legality, and the secrecy, it's not a stretch to say the NSA machine is being used to exploit global economics. However, that's just one reason why NSA exists among a myriad. We're talking censorship, oppression, blackmail fodder, political power, military strategy ... At this level of politics most things are multipurpose. The war on terror, for instance, serves to bolster the military/surveillance/industrial complex, distract from issues back home, fuel political theater during elections, yadda yadda. We're talking about incredibly complex, multifaceted stuff with lots of actors and many varied motivations. So at most the NSA's role as a form of economic control is one of many.

Additionally, while it's possible that Obama and Cheney are consciously involved in some level, I'd guess that the people doing the really big, really shady stuff are out of the spotlight. At least, the ones running the show are. But then, I can't prove that one way or the other; I can only say it's plausible. When you're dealing with controversial stuff like this, stuff which by its nature is sometimes unfalsifiable or otherwise secret/obscure, it's important to keep a level head and remain open to all possibilities, including the possibility that you're wrong; if you get stuck in a certain way of thinking, you risk missing out on even bigger, more important things because they aren't compatible with your worldview.

I find that kind of politically oriented person to be incredibly irksome, and I honestly think less of people's intelligence when they sympathize with tea party radicals.

However, when we are out in public, and he interacts with the filthy liberals, he treats them with a respect that you don't see many people treat each other with even if they agree politically. The guy is a member of FEMA and was in New Orleans slugging away trying to help people survive after Katrina. He was even pinned down by gunfire from roving gangs while checking houses for survivors, and continued to do his work after the gangs were chased off because ""not everyone is like them, and we're here to help 'em all anyway"". If you talk politics with him he'll give you an earful, but you can be damn sure he'll stick his neck out to help you if you need it.

The US Government also double bombs rubble in the SWAT/tribal regions in Pakistan, meaning they bomb a site, and then bomb the rubble where people are running into the fray to pull loved ones who are caught under debris. The principle to do so is the same--if you bomb a suspected terrorist, there are likely other ""bad people"" running into the fray, trying to pull said terrorists out from under the rubble.

Most of the problems now are largely historical, and to suggest that they are all recent developments is naive.

No, I don't blame Obama for it all by any means. But his promises to repeal the Patriot Act, stop the illegal spying, maintain an open government without secrecy and more were all broken. In fact he has moved in the opposite direction, strengthening the government's positions on all of these things.


|I completely agree with you that both parties are to blame for the current state of the government, and would further posit that the two party system encourages corruption. I really do wish that there were more viable choices.

I couldn't agree more.

|On an aside, I do want to interject how I really don't think that there's an 'obvious attack' of any sort on the second amendment - in fact, things are quite good for gun owners in the US now. As of 2010 48 states had concealed carry permits, Democrats voted to allow guns carried into public parks, and in 2008 the Supreme Court overturned the handgun ban in DC, setting precedent for all states. In fact, one could argue that there are GREATER freedoms for gun owners now than there ever were under Presidents Clinton and Bush.

I should have elaborated here. There is without doubt an attack on the second amendment and a wish for this administration to have some negative effect on our gun rights. It has been largely unsuccessful however.

"I had this stupid girl added on FB that I was good friends with in high school. She had left one of my friends and began dating this conservative, religious nutjob who brainwashed her. Most of the time she just had shared religious pictures. But there was two instances where I got offended to no end.

The first was a picture she shared of a man o' war jellyfish. It gave facts about how the jellyfish had no brain and could live for such a long time. It ended off with, ""Which is great news for Obama voters."" If there's one thing I hate, its people who don't understand what goes on in government and solely blames the president.

I went off on her, saying she shouldn't insult people's political views as that's a sure fire way to cause a fight. She promptly deleted it.

The second time was when she shared an article from one of the most sensationalist web sources. Fedup or something? Its so bad that article refer to Obama's cabinet as corrupt criminals and shit like that. It feels like satire. Anyway, the article was complaining about how Obama wants to grant citizenship to tons of illegal immigrants in the U.S. which apparently is really bad now. Her ignorance was unbelievable. She compared granting citizenships to welfare, and how we don't have enough money for our own homeless. But that's not what offended me, it was the fact that she claimed immigrants brought incurable, new diseases to America and that they would recruit more members into the largest terrorist group in America: The MS13. Yeah, her and her boyfriend both believe a transnational street gang is a terrorist group. This is where I lost my shit, because this is Florida we're talking about here. Tons of people, myself included, and her friends were either immigrants or illegal aliens.

"there are a lot of ways but they work differently. The problem is that you have to understand the people you are talking to and the GOAL you are trying to achieve which then gona devise your situation in different categories thus requires different tricks.

Job interview for example: the people you are meeting with a corporate employees, well experienced so they will have a certain expectation of how you are supposed to be according to your resume. Whether you are a very down to earth guy or a special cs nerd who dont care about appearance. The trick here is to BREAK that expectation of them by doing something else. That way their initial mental image will be shattered and they would like to find out more to fill up the void of their expectation. ""Something else"" here doesnt need to be a negative activity, for example a foreign student could get a great initial impression by demonstrating my pronunciation and usages of buffer words to surprise his teacher. Or a CS nerd could get bonus points in interview by demonstrating his social abilities, being able to make small talks about random topics before/after the interview.

Another example would be doing a presentation. In this example your goal is to be able to control the crowd in a way that you could transfer your speech effectively. Jokes is the most obvious hack here but there are also more: choosing your vocabulary better to help the audience understand your presentation of choosing MORE complicated words to impress the audience with your knowledge. Practicing your tone, pace of speech as well as using 'buzz words' that help the audience remember your speech is also widely used as hacks for most political runs. My tips: learn to pause while speaking, a pause at the right place could make a sentence 10000x times more effective. I strongly recommend watching the latest speeches of obama as well as his debate with mitt romney.

I have worked alongside people who own companies worth billions, and I've worked with immigrants on food stamps. And in my experience, they both run the gamut from hardworking and brilliant to lazy and stupid.

There is a huge influence of circumstance and plain old luck that makes a tremendous difference in who's successful and who's not.

You left a six figure job to start your own business. Starting a business is a stressful and difficult task no matter who does it, but knowing you had the education, skill set, and work history to go *back* into a six figure field if the business failed *is a ridiculous advantage* compared to what people at the bottom risk.

Right now, I've got a friend who just started a new, more lucrative job. He's doing well, but from the beginning he's known it's a temporary position for the next few months. He's using it to save money to move a couple hundred miles to go to school.

He knows he can go to the school, he's been accepted in the past, but *he has no idea if he'll find work* where he's planning to move to.

If he doesn't, or if it's not lucrative *enough*, then he won't be able to attend the school he wants. If he doesn't find work at all, he could very well end up homeless hundreds of miles from home.

He doesn't have anything to fall back on if his plan fails. He gets two different bits of advice, in general, the optimists are sure his plan will work, the pessimists think he's being foolish and should just parlay his new experience into another, even better job once his current gig ends, *but*, both of these views *presume* that he'll be able to do so, that there'll be a job available at one place or the other in time to avoid significant hardship.

They ignore the possibility that there simply won't be anyone willing to hire him, or, more likely, that there won't be anyone willing to hire him *at the pay rate he needs*.

I have ten years experience in my field. Military experience relevant to my career, half a dozen skill certifications, and I'm universally praised by my coworkers and my superiors.

I make what's standard for my position in my industry in the tristate area, which is *only 50¢ more than a recent High School Graduate who just walks in and applies.*

My boss, who has *less* experience than I do, but has a college degree in a completely unrelated field, makes *50¢ more than I do*.

We're a contractor, my company is hired to provide us. My company gets *$2M/yr to put us onsite.* My boss, my coworkers, and I take home less than $500k during the year.

*Could* we be payed more? Sure. But the last person who asked for a raise was fired (at will, no stated cause) the very day he asked.

Another site serviced by our company has a random visit from a labor organizer once. Everyone who worked the site was fired the next day.

I work for one of the better companies, we had decent health, dental, vision, &amp; life insurance (after a year with the company) before Obamacare ever came along. But their stinginess with pay and insistence on ridiculous profit margins is pretty standard for the industry in the tristate area. There's nothing better to move *to*, even with my (far, far better than average) qualifications.

And it's this way for nearly all my friends. Hard workers, well qualified, stingy businesses, no way out.

*Half the US* (that's 175 **Million** people) makes less than $30k/yr. Tell me again how they all must be lazy.",2

"When HSBC was found laundering money to terrorists and drug cartels, Attorney General Eric Holder said this:

&gt;But I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy. And I think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large.

[Source](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-06/eric-holder-some-banks-are-so-large-it-difficult-us-prosecute-them)

Now keep in mind that he was appointed by Obama as Attorney General. Now what Obama should have done is come out making a statement along the lines of ""No! You prosecute those involved, or I'll find another Attorney General! The buck stops with me!""

What happens instead? HSBC had to a pay ""record setting fine"" (which by the way was less than they make in profits) and parts (keep in mind ""parts"" not ""all) of executive bonuses had to be deferred. Basically they walked away scot-free, yet if an ordinary person had done this they'd be shipped off to Gitmo in no time.",910

The Soviets sent landers to the moon. The US and Russia both built parts of the International Space Station (I suspect that is why it has that name).

So if we can build a space statio  with the Russians, we should be able to build a man site on the moon. 

No...not unless we want to spend tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. An upper orbit space station is much easier to build and maintain that a permanent manned station on the moon. 

We use the Russian rockets because Congress refused to fund the Saturn V replacement rockets and Obama canceled the Constellation Program. NASA cannot do anything without money or approval.

In my view, the US healthcare system is the worst parts of a private and public system thrown together - Medicare reimbursements are so low that patients with private insurance are overcharged to make up the difference. Regulations prohibit competition across state lines, restricting risk pools to smaller sizes. Minimum coverage requirements under Obamacare require men to purchase maternity coverage.

The basic reality of the situation is that for every American which could do job X, there are 10 more elsewhere that will do a *better job* for 1/10th the price. 

And they'll do a better job because they have to, in order to support larger families, and compete against many more people. They'll also do a better job because their country and company are harsh as fuck and REQUIRE them to apply more effort than their wage is actually worth. They can be forced to work 18 hours/day under threat of losing their jobs if they fuck up or move too slowly. They can also do a better job *because* they work 18 hours/day at it and get really fucking good.

Americans wouldn't last two seconds against Indian, Chinese, and SEA laborers doing similar tasks.

Costs of living in those countries is also lower, and taxes are lower, thus the cost of doing business is lower.

If you were looking for a constitutional reason of why executive orders exist: Executive orders are not outright stated in the constitution, rather they are the implied result/tool of the President being required to enforce the law.

**The following is speculation**

My guess is that executive orders are issued either when the President disagrees with what Congress is doing or when Congress is doing nothing. Also with war-like issues. Congress does not, to the best of my knowledge, direct troops. They can declare ""war"" but it seems largely a term. Officially, Congress has only declared war 5 times, the most recent being World War II.",1

At the risk of quoting Rush Limbaugh, he does use one term I like: Low Information Voter. These are people, both right and left who only get their news either through very left leaning or right leaning sources (if at all), and only respond to pandering. So people on the left only hear ""The Tea Party wants to take away your groceries and health care!"" and people on the right only hear ""Obama wants to take your guns and your freedom!"".

"Actually, funny enough, there aren't any formal qualifications to be a Supreme Court justice - you don't even have to be a lawyer. So my plan to somehow save Obama's life and then somehow convince him to nominate me and then to somehow get confirmed looks pretty good and completely realistic. ",1
"1.) Financial crisis: You've got it all backwards. In fact, the Goldman Sachs guys testified in front of the Government Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations and basically admitted they were issuing mortgages they knew were ""crap"", and even made it a top priority to do so. I don't think there's anything that suggests that the government was actually pushing the banks to make these risky loans. It would be suicide, as we all know who ended up paying the tab after all the risky investments came to a head. The fact that we have such little oversight is the direct result of decades of financial deregulation initiated by Reagan and Bush 1. Guess who lobbied heavily and still does today for even more financial deregulation. Hmmm. Seems like you're confusing the hostage with the gunman.

2.) Basically an attack on public assistance: The right has it completely backwards there too. Public assistance exists as a *result* of the failure of the private sector to provide enough decent employment. By no means does it exist *in spite of* plenty of decent employment opportunities. I don't understand how the right can assault worker's rights, assault wages, and be the ""pro-business"" party (even at the expense of U.S. jobs, which has been the trend), basically crippling the economy, and then attack public assistance programs on top of it. Do they want all the people they just laid off to start rioting in the street because they can't afford food and rent?

3.) Public education: I agree that there's a ton of bureaucracy in the way in public education. But again, that's not a right or left issue. What's annoying to us on the left is that, when it comes to addressing wasteful government spending, conservatives consistently attack the things we should be funding the most (healthcare, education, welfare) and ignore things we should definitely avoid spending money on whenever possible (the military-industrial complex, new prison construction, tax breaks for the rich). So, even if there is a problem with basic public services, why do conservatives always default to attacking those issues that benefit everybody first while ignoring the big elephant(s) in the room?

4.) ""Specious demagoguery"": If it's not a matter of being all pro-government or all anti, then conservatives need to work on their presentation in a bad way. All the ""no big government"" and ""taxed enough already"" slogans aren't helping. When you listen to media outlets that lean more to the left (NPR, RT, I hesitate to include MSNBC), they **do** make those distinctions and make a point of addressing specific programs. When you listen to right-wing media (Fox and talk radio), these distinctions are definitely blurred and everything just tends to be Obama's fault. And when the most vocal individuals in your wing echo these talking points, pretty much verbatim, it shows a huge lack of analysis and thought.

5.) ""No one spends your money as carefully as you do yourself"": Obviously this debate could last forever, but it remains that there are services that don't generate profit that everybody still benefits from. And from what I know, governments *are* constantly doing as much as they can with the fewest personnel... (I'm referring to things like teachers and city engineers, not the military or private defense contractors of course.) And it's not like government staff can line their pockets with the revenue they receive, unlike, oh you know, financial and business executives. Of course, major multinationals are always willing to bribe the government to get their way. But in that case, I blame the person offering the bribe. Isn't that the main problem? Maybe we should impose limits on campaign contributions or, better yet, institute public financing so politicians can't take corporate bribes at all. Well, a quick investigation into that shows which party is the quickest to stand up against that. (Can you guess which one?)",1

I don't think he realized how difficult it would be to enact a lot of what he wanted (obamacare, closing guantanamo, withdrawing all troops, etc).  

I'm not so much disappointed in him as I genuinely feel he thought he could accomplish all of this. Every president inherits the burden of the prior administration, and Obama had a shitty administration to follow.

"There are many brands in the US that are not available in Canada. My Canadian friends often comment about this. I can't believe how excited they were when Target opened in Toronto. 
There is a very different psychology in a Canada. In the US, we tend to think that we don't have enough money, no matter how wealthy we are. Studies prove this. In Canada, Canadians tend to recognize value where Americans don't. For example, if Canadians can go to university for much less than in the US, they see this as value and understand that while it may impact their total income by increasing taxes, it constitutes value. This applies to health care. If Obama had instituted universal health insurance like in a Canada but increased taxes, Americans would not have accepted it. Even if Americans would no longer have to contribute to their company health plan as most do, and even if this actually increased peoples take home pay, they would see this as unacceptable. Canadians recognize this as more logical and representative of value.  Canadians don't earn the salaries we do, yet they recognize that they have a quality lifestyle and a diverse and accepting society in exchange.

I love my country--the USA-- but if I couldn't live here, I would move to Canada in a minute. It is a kinder, gentler version of the US without the fringe nut cases. I'm not totally sure the French Canadians have fully signed on to the Canadian great society and won't someday become a problem, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt as most Canadians do. That said, in the west there is a growing conservative Christian faction similar to our Tea Party who might eventually ruin things. I hope not.

"The only thing that changed was that I realized the Democrats didn't actually represent my interests. 

I was an active Democrat in college in 2000. Then, after September 11, the Democrats as a group got behind the Patriot act, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Military spending increased, civil liberties eroded. My state's Democratic representatives not only grudgingly supported these changes, but *actively campaigned for them*. For me, war is the biggest issue, and I can't vote for anyone who agrees with the notion that we're probably going to be at war from now on.

The fact that, at the time, the Dems as a group didn't support gay marriage was an issue, too. It was obvious that they were standing, alongside conservatives, on the wrong side of history, but too cowardly to take a stand. 

In 2008, I voted for Obama because he was a Constitutional law scholar, he seemed smart, and it seemed like he might be different. He wasn't, or at least not different enough. 

So, without really getting more conservative at all I just sort of fell into small-l libertarianism when the Democrats turned out not to be all that I'd naively assumed they were. ",2

All of the people commenting on this thread saying ""life doesn't matter"" ""do what makes you happy"" ect. are the ones who more so uphold the view that when life ends, it's over. 

Personally, as a Christian, I find great comfort knowing that when my life on earth is over, a new life in Heaven (not the Hollywood set imagery you're thinking of, but real Heaven) will begin. And as a person who has struggled with depression/thoughts of suicide in the past, that is anything but depressing : )

"The Nika Riots in Byzantium.

In the hippodrome where chariots races were held, the crowd (ie- the mob) was split in groups, but the Greens and Blues had the most influence. They would take turns shouting the their team color, followed by ""Nika!"" meaning ""victory"". 

Well, on this particular day, Emperor Justinian was sitting down in his box seat when the crowd immediately starts hurling insults at him. Eventually it gets to the point where *both the Blues and the Greens* are shouting ""Nika!"" *in unison*. Imagine Yankees and Red Sox fans, (but 1000x more hateful towards each other, 1000x poorer, and 1000x more violent) all shouting together at President Obama. Eventually they end up besieging the palace for five days.

I don't wanna regurgitate the whole wiki article. It's short and worth a read, but I'll give you a teaser. It was the worst riots in Byzantine history. The Hagia Sophia was destroyed. Half the city was burned. Tens of thousands of people died. 

Senators took the opportunity to try and overthrow Justinian ( a blue supporter) and install a Green supporter. Justinian wanted to flee, but his wife, Empress Theodora (a goddamn actress he married, which back meant she had the same reputation as a prostitute) shamed him into staying. Justinian sent a popular eunuch ( think Varys) with a bag of gold into the erupting, murderous mob to bribe the leaders of the Blue, reminding them that the man they were deposing was going to be replaced by a Green supporter.

You called someone a fool for using Occam's Razor correctly. By far the most likely scenario is one mentally ill kid who loved guns going crazy. Occam's Razor states that the result with the least assumptions is usually correct. One we assume it's a mentally ill kid doing it which has happened many times before. The other is the we have a massive government conspiracy involving 1000's of people, all of whom want to ban guns. Even Fox News, the Republican Party and the NRA don't challenge them and let their propaganda go.

"You didn't specify what nationality you had to be, so here is a perspective from an Australian:

I like him. Most of the time, we only get 10-60 minutes (through speeches etc) to determine what sort of a person our governmental leaders are. We never get to meet them face to face. Obama, has got charisma. The guy seems genuine. He is probably the BEST public speaker I have ever seen, and inspired me whenever he spoke, and I am not even American.

Lately I have seen he has been given a hard time regarding NSA surveillance and certain policies that not everyone agrees with. Firstly, the surveillance. Privacy is a big deal, and to be honest, it seems like a much more massive deal to Americans than everyone else. Being brutally honest - Australian goverment got caught doing the same thing. We are not lynching our leaders and it has barely been spoken of in the news. I guess for us it's just not that big of a deal.

Lastly, Obamacare - This one, I will never understand. Australia has it's own medical system (Medicare) and has for longer than I have been alive. We simply wouldn't know any different. You broke your arm? Trip to the hospital, have an x-ray, get it cast, going home with no bills. I cannot fathom life without it, simply because I haven't lived it.

I can say from my life experience with this system, is that it works. I believe that everybody should be treated, regardless of wealth. We have systems in place so that the wealthier class must pay for private insurance, or get taxed higher (Medicare Levy). 

I think as an outsider looking in, I get the impression he simply didn't live up to expectations.  But on the other hand, I see presidents like JFK get idiolised, this is a guy who cheated on his wife?

Politics is complicated, so is public favour.

No, he continually says that humans are causing it.

Very few political leaders attended that summit. Obama didn't either. he gave a short address at the opening because he happened to be there due to the Ukrainian conflict. That was a coincidence

&gt;The climate change argument is absolute crap

This was said many years ago and he has since recanted that statement.

&gt;Coal is good for humanity, coal is good for prosperity, coal is an essential part of our economic future, here in Australia, and right around the world

Well that is a pretty self evident thing. If you don't believe that then perhaps you can tell me how you build anything without it. We can generate electricity, but we can't make steel. And given that he made the comments at the opening of a metallurgical coal mine it makes sense.

The comment about equal representation was when he was a student. I'm not sure what your ideas were back when you were at uni, but I suspect you would want not to remember them. He has also gone on record as saying how stupid those comments were.

if you want to judge a politician by what they said over 35 years ago, then we can go back and examine some of the things said by any political leader you like and have a lot of fun.

After re-reading this policy, it does seem strange, I will admit. But, it was added to clarify all of the negativity about gun ownership, and to establish a basic idea of the possible roles that armed citizens would actually play in these kinds of situations, and the responsibilities that may come with it.

Conceal carriers may account for a small, slender percentage of crime, but, there are always those people who think that this percentage is opposite, causing instead the bulk of all overall crime. That is what this policy is here to clear up - all gun ownership misconceptions. ",1

Exactly, they were good little patriots that didn't report on it as much.

How exactly?  Bush had warrantless wiretaps, Gitmo, war for no reason, drone attacks.  Is it just the volume since Obama is a little more open about this stuff than Bush was?  Obama has had these wars his entire Presidency, whereas Bush waited a few years before invading Iraq to add that to his Afghanistan and Pakistan numbers.

&gt;What I do know is that it didn't seem like was Bush was trying to amass so much power for the Fed like Obama has been. Obama seems like he wants big Fed and he wants it involved in so many aspects of peoples every day lives.
He didn't have to amass power, Congress bent over and gave him what he wanted.  But sorry you have bad 'feels' about what he is doing.  I generally deal in facts.  Fact - Obamacare has guaranteed healthcare for Americans under 65 for the first time in history.

I agree with you on the giving up freedom to protect freedom.  I felt that way when W fucked us over with the Patriot act.  If it takes a Dem abusing it instead of a 'patriotic' Republican for Republicans to realize it was a fucking mistake and want to act to get rid of it, then so be it.",0

"Full Story (Note: I am a terrible story teller, so I will try to tell this the best I can).

The year was 2010, I was in high school and I was headed to my 5th period english class. When I walk I see a huge man standing by my teacher's desk, I ignore him and just walk to my seat as I usually do; that is, until I saw my teacher beckon me to the front of the room. She tells me that this man needs to take me down the administration office. The man then leads me out of the room and starts to lead me to the office. Now, my school was large and winding, so our walk was pretty long and quiet, but halfway through the man asks me ""do you know why they want to talk to you?"" I say ""no, I have no clue"" and continue on. This man himself wasn't Secret Service, but rather he was the football coach (I wasn't the type of student who would recognize any coaches or athletic department employees at all), and it turns out he didn't know why I was being pulled out of class either; he was just told to come and get me (why the football coach, I have no clue. He was big and intimidating, and maybe that was the point). Anyway, our walk ends and we arrive at the office. I walk in and see dozens of badges, suits, earpeices, as well as a friend and his mother. The first thing that someone informed me was ""You are not in any trouble, everything is alright."" Which I must admit put me at ease, since the room was filled with local and state police, as well as members of the Secret Service. On this particular day, President Obama was visiting a local vocational school. And it just so happens that my friend and one of his friends had been talking online about ""showing up the event and demonstrating our second amendment rights"" (or something like that. In fact, I'm sure it was far less euphemistic). And the authorities wanted me to act as a character witness to ensure them that these people posed no real threat. Well, I had only known one of the kids involved, and the other kid I hardly knew (except that I played airsoft with him regularly [fun fact: this same place I played airsoft also featured another local criminal, Eric Frein]). They wanted everything I knew about him, so I scoured his forum posts to find what guns (replica and otherwise) he had. I was pretty much a nervous wreck the whole time, despite not being in trouble for anything (because who wouldn't be nervous when a room full of law enforcement is looking at you)",3

Not for us. We had to get more coverage than we need (things like maternity for my 50 yr old mom) and it's about 800$ more a month. I know it's helping a lot of people but it's hurting people too. It's good that people who couldn't afford it can afford it now but there's a lot of people who are having to drop the new one because they can't afford it. Not to mention Obama promised we could keep our same plans and that wasn't true. So it's good/bad ,1
Everyone jumps on the hate Bush bandwagon but no one will call out Obama for the same things.  Lib hypocrisy at its finest.  Most of the haters now day's weren't old enough to remember 9/11 or the mood of the country at the time.  Once the dust settled all America wanted was revenge.  Congress voted to go to war (even Hillary Clinton).  Bush delivered an immediate response and America loved him for it.  It wasn't until people got bored of nothing more than insurgency and IED attacks and turned on him.  When nothing turned up with WMD's the Bush bashing took an even bigger more popular stance.  Obama has been commander in chief now for six years but shares none of the anti-war hatred. ,15

"03 FFL here, not an industry specialist so hopefully some 01's, 02's or 07's can chime in and help me keep all this straight.

&gt;I'm from the UK so don't know the process involved. 

How does the process work? Well, lets say you get a wild hair up your ass one day and decide you want to buy a gun. Maybe you want to shoot competitively, or perhaps you want one for self-defense, or maybe you just want to knock down some tin cans with your friends on the ranch. Here's whats going to happen:

You will locate a gun shop near you. These shops must be federally licensed by BATFE (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives) who regulate the firearms trade in America. In order to “engage in the business of buying or selling firearms” a person/business must obtain what is known as an [Federal Firearms License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Firearms_License) and meet certain requirements depending on the type of business they will be engaged in.

Upon entering the premise and being overwhelmed by the smell of Hoppe's and Skoal, the gruff, likely bearded owner/shopkeeper of the shop will help you select the firearm you want. Once this is complete, you will fill out one of [these forms, known as a 4473,](http://www.atf.gov/files/forms/download/atf-f-4473-1.pdf) and sign the affadavit on page two. The owner/shopkeeper/clerk will then take your form *(and a state issued ID) and use the information you've provided to conduct a mandatory federal background check on you to ensure you are not a prohibited person. This is usually accomplished through the FBI's [NICS system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Instant_Criminal_Background_Check_System) although some states may opt to perform the background checks themselves so that they can combine the FBI's database results with their own state and local crime information databases.

Once this is complete, the FFL will be told to either proceed with the sale, delay the sale, or deny the sale. For the sake of this example, we're assuming that you're not fool enough to be a prohibited person and trying to buy a gun from an FFL. Once the dealer gets the proceed you will pay for the gun and the gun is now yours to take home. 

However, depending on what state you reside in you may have to meet other requirements before you take possession of your gun. In some cases, and in certain states, you may have to meet certain stringent requirements even before you set foot in the store to buy the gun. This is especially true in states that require purchase permits or other possession permitting systems. Some states may require that you wait a certain amount of days after you've paid for your gun before you can take possession of it, these are known as waiting periods.

There exists a great variation among the states as to how they regulate firearms, so without further detail I can't respond as to how the “typical” purchase goes except to show you how it usually works in less restrictive states.

*I forgot to add the part where the FFL takes your state issued ID, CCW, or other acceptable document establishing residency, makes a photocopy, and checks it against your 4473. That part is pretty important. Should be up there occurring sometime before, during, or right after you fill out your 4473.

&gt;I understand that the right to bear arms was included in the United States Constitution, but the idea seems unusual and is foreign to me. 

To fully understand and appreciate the Constitution takes considerable study. I studied Political Science with a concentration in American Political Studies for my degree, and I still struggle with it.

What you need to understand about the Second Amendment is that the Constitution is a document that codifies negative rights. This means that it protects your rights *from* infringement by the state. Many people erroneously assume that the Constitution and its Bill of Rights are an act of the state granting individuals rights, when in fact it is the opposite. The authors who drafted this document were enlightenment thinkers who believed that man was born with certain natural rights, rights which were inherent in the fiber of their very being simply because they existed as men, and that no government could ever strip these away from the individual. Therefore, they designed the Constitution and Bill of Rights to protect them accordingly.

The Second Amendment has long been fought over by those who believe it to protect a collective right versus those who believe that it protects an individual right. Those who believe that it protects a collective right see it as an antiquated relic meant to protect state militias in a time when there was no standing national army. Those who believe it to be an individual right argue that the amendment's preamble clause does not impair the explicit guarantee that an individual may keep and bear arms. Decades of case law exist across all levels of the courts as to which of these interpretations is correct as the judiciary attempts to balance public safety versus the nebulous concept of natural rights. Most recently (in 2008) the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed in D.C. v. Heller that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to arms, eschewing the collective right argument.

However, the Second Amendment remains one of the few provisions of the Bill of Rights which has not been incorporated to the states, meaning that while it curtails federal legislative incursions it does not extend its authority to state or local governments. This is how the U.S. can have such a patchwork of gun laws outside those which are federally mandated.

&gt;The reason I ask is regarding the Elliot Rodgers situation currently ongoing in California. Are no suspicions aroused when a young man who lives in a city purchases 3 semi-automatic handguns? 

Not necessarily. I don't know CA's laws well enough to give a detailed response to this. [18 USC § 923(g)(3)(A)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/923) requires FFL's to report multiple sales of two or more pistols or revolvers to a non-licensee over any five consecutive business days. These reports must be forwarded to the State police or other appropriate State or local law enforcement agency who has jurisdiction in the locale in which the sale takes place. However, this is no specific requirement that action be taken, since purchasing multiple handguns is not against federal law. The law simply states that the purchases must be reported to BATFE and the state/local police by the FFL performing the sale.

I don't know what other laws CA has on the books about multiple handgun purchases. So I can't give you a complete answer to this.

*I'm going to add this link to [Wikipedia's CA Gun Law article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_California) to my response here so those who are curious can look up the relevant state gun laws. I have no experience or expertise with CA, so I will refrain from espousing half-truths and suppositions and let OP find the info he/she needs.

&gt;Also, are there safeguards in place to prevent these situations from happening? 

Like what? Now that you have read a little about the process and the Second Amendment, what would you propose?

&gt;What was the impact of Obama's gun-control proposals on US citizens?

Depends on who you ask. I wrote this post to be a non-partisan answer and am going to keep it that way.",5

What do they actually want right now, what does the protest seek to achieve?  Your answer is much to vague.  The movement is meaningless if their is no goal, no conditions to be met.

A few links to show how the ACA is affecting jobs/employment.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/cbo-botched-health-care-law-rollout-will-reduce-signups-by-1-million-people/2014/02/04/c78577d0-8dac-11e3-98ab-fe5228217bd1_story.html

http://www.californiahealthline.org/articles/2014/2/5/aca-could-cut-number-of-fulltime-workers-by-2-5-m-analysis-say

https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/45010-breakout-AppendixC.pdf

There are a ton of links to articles showing how the ACA has affected jobs/employment.

But here are my final comments, because I would like to end this conversation.

1. Both of us are human, and neither of us are always right, no matter what you think.

2. I don't need you to agree with me, but I am not trying to insult you for that, but you have insulted me.

3. This is what bothers me about you, not that you disagree with me, that's totally fine. What bothers me is that you insult people who don't agree with you, is that how a person behaves these days?

I acknowledge I can be wrong, I can make mistakes, I can screw up.

But I do my best to not be rude to other people about it, and while I may not be perfect, I do try. 

Now my own personal opinions, is that I have watched my own father who is a retired pediatric dentist, and I have listened to him for decades. And it is because of that, that I base my own personal experiences.

No health insurance system is ever going to be perfect.

But for every benefit there is a cost.

It may be wonderful to have all these new benefits guaranteed, and you may freely enjoy that.

But those benefits always have a cost/price and a consequences.

The end-result of the ACA has massively increased the cost of businesses doing business. You may not be aware of this, but businesses do not have endless pile of resources to pay for any fancy new laws or bills that affect them.

This bill is detrimental to businesses, because it raises the cost of employing full time people so much, that it has forced them to stop hiring so many full time people. 

Not because they don't want to or need more people, but when full time people expect health benefits as part of their employment package, and now with ACA drastically increasing a businesses cost of hiring a new full time employee. 

Plus each month as the ACA, it made the business market feel very unstable, as new wrinkles came out, because it appears that very few people who voted on it, actually read the law.

Plus, Businesses need stability, they need to know that there isn't constant change in the laws that affect their bottom line.

Plus, like it or not, President Obama kept changing the law, after the law was passed, which also added to the instability.

Now, let me share something personally.

I am personally handicapped in a number of ways, so I have pre-existing conditions. 

However, it has been very hard to get health insurance before this, but I am an adult, I don't demand that companies cover me when their risks to doing so far outweigh their benefits.

Health Insurance companies exist to make money pure and simple. 

And there's nothing wrong with that, but we purchase health insurance as a financial blanket to help us manage the fluctuation in costs that occur as part of our daily lives.

I think honestly the whole health industry needs a massive redo from hospitals to insurance and all.

But nationalizing it, has clearly shown what an utter disaster it is.

You can freely disagree, and you may enjoy what you get out of it, but let's not pretend that not everyone is having the same experience that you are.

I hope you have a great weekend. 

Let me end this reply with one of my favorite quotes.

"&gt;However, the 2012 Republican Party platform contained language in opposition to gay marriage, referenced the ""homosexual rights agenda,""

This is referring to Obama having an agenda. And it's all politics. Barack Obama was against gay marriage back in 2008, now he's miraculously on board. Now that he is, he knows that the subject is very difficult for conservatives to get behind, so he's pushing it as hard as he can. It's a reference that Obama and the liberals don't really care about gay marriage, they care more about whatever the hivemind mob is leaning.

&gt;there are some vocal racists among the Republican rank and file

Your side has quite a good amount of donations from Donald Sterling, for the record.

&gt;""urban culture"" and ""welfare queens""

I'm sorry, but these do exist. And it's foolish to pretend they don't. An urban culture where 80% of blacks are born without a father present in the home is an alarming statistic and terrible for everyone. To not even be able to bring up someone's race and be unable to say this is a problem for a certain community is racist in itself, because it shows you think that blacks must be treated with kid gloves and can't handle that there are problems within urban families. There are no intelligent black people who believe it's perfectly great that 80% are born out of wedlock and without fathers. That's lunacy.

And welfare queens do exist also. I am not for eliminating welfare, because there are people who legitimately need help, and this is the United States, we won't let anyone go starving in the street. But I do not want my taxes to go to a welfare queen doing drugs and having a grand old time with her EBT card.

"20 examples of socialism kthx bye

1. The Military/Defense - The United States military is the largest and most funded socialist program in the world.  It operates thanks to our taxpayer dollars and protects the country as a whole. From the richest citizens to the homeless who sleep under the bridge. We are all protected by our military whether we pay taxes or not. This is complete socialism.

2. Highways/Roads - Those roads and highways you drive on every single day are completely taxpayer funded. Your tax dollars are used to maintain, expand, and preserve our highways and roads for every one's use. President Eisenhower was inspired by Germany's autobahn and implemented the idea right here in America. That's right, a republican president created our taxpayer funded, national highway system. This was a different time, before the republican party came down with a vicious case of rabies that never went away.

3. Public Libraries - Yes. That place where you go to check out books from conservative authors telling you how horrible socialism is, is in fact socialism. Libraries are taxpayer funded. You pay a few bucks to get a library card and you can read books for free for the rest of your life.

4. Police - Ever had a situation where you had to call the police? Then you have used a taxpayer funded socialist program. Anyone can call the police whether they pay taxes or not. They are there to protect and serve the community, not individuals. This is complete socialism on a state level, but still socialism all the same. Would you rather have to swipe your credit card before the police will help you?

5. Fire Dept. - Hopefully you have never had a fire in your home. But if you have, you probably called your local taxpayer-funded fire department to put the fire out. Like police, this is state socialism. You tax dollars are used to rescue your entire community in case of a fire. It use to be set up where you would pay a fee every month to the fire dept. for their service. If you didn't pay, they let your house burn down. Sadly, a man from Tennessee had this exact situation happen to him in 2011 because he didn't pay his $75.00 fee. I guess that small town in Tennessee would rather let people's houses burn down that resort to evil socialism. So don't take for granted the fact that you have a 24/7 fire dept. to put out your burning home thanks to socialism.

6. Postal Service - Like having mail delivered directly to your front door and paying next to nothing to send mail anywhere you want? Well it's all made possible by socialism.

7. Student Loans and Grants - Did you go to College? If you did, you family might not have been rich enough to pay your way through. So you got your education anyway through student loans and grants from the federal government at taxpayer expense. Of course you have to pay back the loans, but if not the government, did you know anyone else who was going to lend you tens of thousands of dollars? Probably not. So the taxpayers lent you the money and you paid it back with slight interest. The government grants you accepted were gifts from the taxpayer and the federal government that you did not have to pay back. Socialism got you through school.

8. Bridges - Along with our highways, our government used your taxpayer dollars to build bridges. This allows the public to travel across rivers without having to sail or swim.

9. Garbage Collection - Like having your garbage collected once a week instead of having to drive it to the landfill yourself? Thank socialism.

10. Public Landfills - Taxpayer dollars are used to have places to dump all of our garbage that is collected by taxpayer funded garbage men.

11. War - That's right! War would not be possible without socialism. Your tax dollars are used to fight wars for your country. This is Big Government at it's biggest. Private companies don't attack other countries, at least not yet. Government is the only entity in America that can defend us from foreign enemies and our tax dollars are used for every second of it. Socialism has brought down Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and Bin Laden. War may very well be the most socialist thing on this list.

12. Farm Subsidies - Our government uses taxpayer funds to pay farmers and businesses to provide their income and keep them growing food for the public.

13. CIA - The Central Intelligence Agency is vital to America's security. The CIA is completely taxpayer funded to protect the public from enemies.

14. FBI - The Federal bureau of investigations is a taxpayer funded government agency.

15. Congressional Health Care - As Republicans in congress warn us of the evils of government-run health care, most of them are covered by taxpayer-funded government-run health care. You literally pay for their health care while they tell you that paying for your neighbors health care through a public option or single-payer system is socialism. They are 100% correct, it is socialism. They're just not telling you that they like their socialist health care, they just don't think you should have it. They are afraid you might like it better than the private insurance you have now that funds their campaigns and gives them money to push what is best for them and not for you. Members of congress are free to opt out of their evil government health care, but most of them don't because deep down, they like socialism too.

16. Polio Vaccine - In the 1950's polio ravaged the United States. Until Dr. Jonas Salk invented a cure, finally ridding America of this terrible disease. Dr. Salk could have sold his vaccine in the free market and made millions and millions of dollars. Instead he gave it to the federal government to begin eradicating polio. He said that he made plenty of money as a scientist and felt it was too important to try and profit from or create a business around.

17. EPA - Republicans hate this taxpayer-funded government program because they have the nerve to tell corporations that they may have to follow environmental rules ad regulations for the greater good of the earth and the people who live on it. But if you don't like breathing mercury, drinking dirty water, and breathing in chemicals, you should like this example of socialism working for the people.

18. Social Security - You pay a tax to help ensure that our grandparents and senior citizens of America have money to live off of when they are retired or too elderly to work. I love hearing rich people bitch about this one because the truth is that they do not pay a social security tax, like most payroll taxes. This little piece of socialism helps prevent our senior citizens from sinking into poverty and starving to death.

19. Museums - Many museums are privately owned by organizations and groups, but many are also taxpayer-funded state, national, and federal museums.

20. Public Schools - Can't afford to send your children to an expensive private school? Thanks to socialism and government, you child can still get an education. Public education has been under attack for decades in this country by the radical right because public schools don't teach Christianity to your children and it enables people like Barack Obama to work hard, gain scholarships, and eventually become President of the United States.

"Free speech just means the government can't arrest you for what you say. You're allowed to voice your opinions and criticize the government without being sent to the Gulags or a concentration camp.
It doesn't protect you from going up to someone and calling them a ""dickwad"". Then when they tell you to shut up or call you something back, you can't say ""Freedom of speech you can't hurt me!""
Same with in schools, or at a private residence, or a place of employment.
It allows you to voice your opinion about things and not be hunted down by the government, and that ONLY. 
You can say ""I don't like ObamaCare"", or ""I think having a woman as president would be shitty"", or ""I hate black people"" and other things of that nature. But don't get mad if someone gets pissed at you for saying those things and say you have freedom of speech and can say what you want whenever.",5
"I'd like to say that I dislike Obamacare because it is more government subsidizing corporations, but doesn't address the problem with pricing and cost transparency or complexity.",1
"To find a good alternative we have to recognize that the problem were facing is an insurance problem, not a healthcare problem.

Hypothetically this is how insurance works: a hundred people pay into a system that will cover them if they are sick or hurt. If someone breaks there arm, they are completely covered because the other 99 people have paid equally with them to cover the medical expenses.

Today we have 100 people paying into the system, and close to 100 people all utilizing the insurance to pay for medical issues. These issues range from various cancers, to sports injuries, to mental disorders.

So solving our problem would require increasing the general health of our population. Eating well and being physically active reduce rates of depression, heart problems and even skin cancer. Not to mention that 80 percent of all patients diagnosed with depression would experience the same ""anti depressive"" results from a placebo.

We need to make eating healthy cheaper, increase the knowledge of fitness and generally start living more productive lives. 

Our current healthcare system is focused on treatment, not prevention. The rules of supply and demand dictate that if the demand for healthcare is lowered (IE reduced rates of sickness) then the cost of healthcare will go down as the supply of doctors compared to patients will increase.

While I know none of this solves problems immediately, and this doesn't serve as a true ""alternative"" to Obamacare, these do serve as basic principles that could eventually fix our healthcare system.",-1

And no matter what, we were sinners going to Hell if we questioned anything. And when I left they were hateful. I lived in a small town at the time, and so whatever this church said got around, true or not. So they did what they could to be awful to us, and my family.

And then we factor in that the USA is a hegemonic power, where any decision has ripple effects throughout the entire world. The reaction to Obama from the international community is one of those ripples. An end to the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars is a big ripple in the international community. And now here we are dealing with a resurgence in Russian Nationalism and who is the world looking to? The USA.  Who provides the most humanitarian aid in the world? The USA.

"Not the OP, but I remember Obama's election clear as day. The weeks leading up to it were heated. During Bush's presidency (2000-2008) there was so much negativity and unrest. Obama ran on a platform of hope and change, and it was incredibly effective. 

I was a college student at the time. I was leaving my boyfriend's apartment in Manhattan and taking the subway back to Fordham in the Bronx. The subway train I was on got delayed due to some pipe burst and I had to take another train, which had an elevated platform in Harlem, a historically black neighborhood. I knew the election results would be announced soon but nothing was showing on my phone.

All of the sudden, as I looked out over 125th Street from the train platform, people exploded in celebration. People were screaming, honking their horns, lighting firecrackers. People were elated, running in the streets. It was like an impromptu parade. The first black president had been elected. It was amazing to watch. I was filled with hope.",1

He has stated so many times and his gun control policies back this up.    He is only against one specific type of gun.   military-style assault weapons.   Yes, the NRA is arguing the point because they keep telling their members (yes i am one of them)  that to ""take guns from ANY american is an attack on us all""   quoted from one of their newsletters, in a direct reference to cracking down on background checks to weed out violent criminals and anyone else who might be kept from being able to buy more guns.",-1

"ISIS would never have gotten a foothold in Iraq, because we'd back in there, having seen the warning signs of a collapsing Iraqi government.

The Syrian civil war would have ended in a properly brokered cease-fire and change of government.

We'd have gotten an honest $250 billion national highway and bridge repair job done.

Our national debt would have gone down by at least a half-trillion dollars, instead of up by nearly 4 trillion dollars.

Oil would be flowing from Canada to the Texas coast refineries via the Keystone pipeline, and gasoline would be under $3.00 a gallon again.

The IRS would be eviscerated after the Obama political dirty tricks became fully documented public knowledge.  We'd be talking about and planning for the gradual replacement of income taxes with consumption (*not* VAT) taxes.  The IRS would soon have no power over ordinary citizens, only businesses.  And tax exemption status would be done away with entirely.

At least 20 Obama administration staff would have been indicted, tried and jailed for high crimes.

Hillary Clinton would have been exposed as the true incompetent and disgrace she was as Secretary of State, and her hopes for seeking the Presidency would have vanished overnight.  She commits suicide rather than go to jail for conspiracy in the Benghazi cover-up affair and the illegal campaigning from the State Department.

The Mexico-USA border would be less porous, and people illegally crossing the border would be deported the same or next day instead of being granted indefinite release in the US.

The government deports every illegal or resident alien from our jails or on parole, with a new law putting the death penalty on the table for any who show their face again in the US.  We'd have at least a million fewer illegal immigrants in the country, as they'd have self-deported fearing for their lives and knowing amnesty was out of the picture for at least a decade.

Obamacare would be repealed in full.  Medicare/Medicaid would be expanded instead, and HHS gets a serious budget for rooting out and fixing fraud.  Justice gets a similar bump to jail the fraudsters.",0

"IIRC Powell's state department was repeatedly brushed aside by the more hawkish Rumsfeld and Cheney. It brings to mind the image of LBJ and McNamara deciding bombing targets in Vietnam at lunch meetings with no generals present. I remember reading in a book (I think it was *Obama's Wars* by Bob Woodward, (Highly recommend)) that for Iraq Powell's state department had composed a long report on the logistics and considerations that come with an invasion of Iraq but the report was ignored by Defense to the point where the DoD was (VERY rough quote) ""trying to figure out why there was no power, but the State Department knew exactly why and no one asked them."" All in all, I don't think Powell deserves the brunt of the blame for the false information used to justify war, even despite his testimony.

There is no way for him to fix this as he will continue to try to work with republicans like he has for the last 6 years which will keep him to the right of center.

I personally would rather he do nothing than pass bullshit with republicans.  I hope he acts on immigration because republicans are just looking for any issue they can cite as a reason they can't work with Obama.

If he orders a policy change on immigration which is part of his job, republicans will claim he refused to work with them and ride that for the next 2 years.  But because obama actually moved on immigration, he will get back the hispanic vote which was lost in the past election because he refused to act and retarded dems acted like they don't support Obama.

In the end, Obama will be opposed by republicans no matter what.  He might as well control the issue by making republicans denounce any fixes for immigration.",2

People who are taking an actual scientific approach to this want *evidence*. Not a bunch of claims. Not a bunch of people repeating rumors, but good evidence... and it just never materializes.

This is the same reason why you'll ask these people what kind of evidence they have, and they won't bring anything up, they'll just insist you *have to watch* this 3 hour youtube documentary. They don't have any good evidence, but they've got people talking about it passionately for hours on end, and if you just continually expose yourself to that, it starts to seem reasonable, even though it has nothing to do with solid facts.

"We are having the exact same problem in my home country (America). I am not very educated on what is happening with the immigration ""flood"" in America so I can give you the basic story of what is happening. There was a statement from either our current president (Obama) or one of our other presidents (Clinton) saying that immigrants will have safety when they are crossing the Mexican border. So for some reason this has started a wave of immigrants coming from South America and crossing through the Mexican border. So our border portrol got flooding with kids being shipped here from smugglers that tge parents had bought to bring their kids to America, or to bring their kids to them somewhere in America. There must of been some law that stated that we cant just return these kids back to South America for some reason that I dont know. But so these kids are coming in illegaly and we are losing space to hold these kids. So we are starting to send these kids up north by Wisconsin and Michigan. But because these kids are coming in illegally, we dont know if they have had an education in South America or if they contributed to the work force. So we can be getting these kids that may have no experience in the work force or even know the abc's. So we really dont know what were going to do with these kids being shipped here.

"This all circles back around to my original statement: ""moderates"" and the spectrum the flanks both sides in mainstream US politics are only marginally different from one another. Because the spectrum is so narrow (leaning dramatically toward the right in global terms) it's not hard to see why 1) democrats vote in favor of military interventionism 2)republicans gut social services and criminalize undocumented migrants regardless of the human suffering and cost 3) liberals tend to cowtow to prevailing big business interests that they claim to oppose them (Obama and Clinton's economic policies) as readily as their much hated conservative counterparts.
 
And I will compare instances of racism in the US because of the striking omission and silence about the overwhelming fact that we are not ""post-racist"" as liberals and conservatives both chant year after year. 


No mention of the continued legal structures that criminalize black and brown life, and the thousands of other ways brutal racism lives on even under the US's first African-American president's administration. Any sort of knowledge of the past 50 years would indicate that this ""post-racial"" fanatasy has never come to pass and democrats are just as complicit in it as anyone else. Any liberal and moderare democrat leaders, ""progressives"" and their even more insane conservative counterparts have presided over a century of murder, war, conquest, lynchings, discrimination, and economic inequality. What is there to defend here? Or are you suggesting that I ""pick the lesser of two evils"" like a good American voter?

Much more shocking is your hinted insistance that all of this is somehow okay, because your loyalty to your chosen party makes its historical and systemic behavior and influences perfectly legitimate even when it sides with its opponents.

Whether he tried for a while or not, he gave up/doesn't any more and makes regular, blatant attacks on the Republican party, past and present, as an excuse for why he can't get things done. Whether it's fact or reality is a different matter but it reflects the inadequacy of his leadership abilities, which is the substance of this thread.

As far as the ignorance of transforming food -- I agree, but yet disagree with you. Why is it every other culture likes to rip on American's for 'ruining their food.' Oh, I am terribly sorry that our country was founded as a melting pot of other cultures, so we do not have 'something of our own.' People can eat and create whatever they feel like. Get over it. Tacos, as American's know and eat them as are freaking delicious. I am sorry I do not like a **real** taco that is a corn tortilla filled with mashed up beans and deep fried. My bad.

This is what LBJ did to get support for various bills. From both Democrats and Republicans reports, Obama is above doing that. He's isolated with a core group of faithful and in particular really doesn't enjoy the act of politicking. 

You can argue it never would has worked because most Republicans won't deal with a black Commander-in-chief. Maybe, impossible to quantify.  And he didn't try, and so what?  He definitely wouldn't be able to arm twist like LBJ, but so what. Do it anyway and find a way. Maybe not everyone falls in line, but some minds could be changed with him making a persistent effort.

The ego it took for him to be narcisstic enough to think he was the best man for the job also gives him a tremendous blind spot.  He thinks he's above having to sway people he doesn't like to his side, despite his lip service to Lincoln's ""Team of Rivals"".  He likes that idea of that more than he likes actually implementing it.",0
"Abe Lincoln.

As a foreigner who interacts with Americans (or any American who isn't a history buff), here's who you need to know:

* George Washington. 1st president. Was a general, kicked your ancestors' asses. There's a holiday for him in February.

* Abe Lincoln. 16th president. Led the nation during the Civil War (1861-65), was assassinated the same year. He also has a holiday in February.

* Teddy Roosevelt. 26th president. All-around badass.

* Franklin Delano Roosevelt, or FDR (distant relation to Teddy). 32nd president. Ran for 4 terms, led the nation through the Depression and WWII. Died in 1945, while in office.

* John F. Kennedy. 35th President. Handsome as shit, probably banged Marilyn Monroe, and was assassinated in 1963.

* George W. Bush. 43rd president. Texan, not much of a genius, the best punching bag liberal comedians have ever wanted. If it happened between 2000 and 2008, blame him.

* Barack Obama. 44th (current) president. Biracial, which is kind of a big deal. If it happened between 2009 and now, blame him.",1

I didn't include it specifically because most of it was paid back. Although technically it was federal spending and could have been counted, if I was going to 'cheat' one way or the other I was going to do it in a way that benefits the republicans. Their numbers are bad enough already, no need to embellish.

Again, I went strictly by Bush's '09 budget of $3.1T, which means that the other $400B spent off budget in '09 did not count against him in any way.",1

"If we needed Obama to do one thing, it was to take us back from the post-9/11 excesses of the Bush-Cheney adminstration.  Obama campaigned on that, but once in office he showed a real lack of leadership in doing what needed to be done.  Instead, he ended up presiding over the same programs he campaigned against, and in many cases expanding them, such as of course NSA spying.  

One thing I'll give him credit for is ending US torture in secret prisons, as far as we know, [sort of](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/206843-obama-did-not-end-torture).   I think that was the most important one and I don't want to diminish that.  But we continue to have warrantless spying, [gag-order letters](https://www.eff.org/issues/national-security-letters) that seem to blantantly violate the first amendment, [aggressive prosecutions of intelligence whistleblowers](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/06/obama-abuse-espionage-act-mccarthyism), and the assumption of seemingly limitless power to conduct military strikes on other nations without consulting congress or the American people.  These are things Obama has not only tolerated, but expanded.  

The signal this sends is that the Bush-Cheney policies are mostly here to stay.  9/11 really did repeal large swaths of the Constitution, and America really can't afford to pretend it believes in all that liberty claptrap anymore.  This is why the Obama administration represents the lost hope of an entire generation of young people who used to believe in America.",0
"The content is unverifiable anecdotes by someone with a reason to exaggerate the truth, especially given the timing of this article (it was written right as Pres. Bush's library was being opened). If a liberal had written this, it would be genuinely interesting in the same way that an aide to John Boehner wring about Pres. Obama's deep and abiding nationalism would be. As it stands, people who worked in his administration (Richard Perle, John O'Neill, and John Dilulio, in particular) have contradicted Hennessey's account. Add in Bush's actual behavior in front of cameras and I find no reason to assume he is possessed of a titanic intellect. He's probably a smart guy compared to most college graduates but he's no analytical genius. ",1

"I agree with you there, but I also think that people take it WAYYYY overboard. I mean, during the re-election (and before then as well) people were throwing the racist card around for those who opposed Obama. Personally, I don't agree with him (Obama) and quite frankly it has nothing to do with his skin color. I think people also confuse being racist with bringing up stereotypes. If someone makes a comment, for instance, about a black man eating watermelon, or Asians having slanted eyes, or LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE, people call it racist. It simply isn't. Racism is based on hatred toward someone based on their race (at the very minimum discrimination). However, just because someone makes a comment about something fitting into a stereotype, that does not make them a racist. If you fit into a stereotype, that doesn't automatically make me think less of you, let alone cause me to harbor racism-fueled hatred for you.",6

"Ugh, my grandmother is one of these religious right, Fox News, bumpersticker, hobby lobby, people. She ""prays"" weekly outside of an abortion clinic near by, which she affectionately refers to as ""the abortion mill"". The other day I was driving with her and she was talking about how Obama is taking away her freedom of religion. Being doubtful of this claim I asked her how exactly he was doing this. She replied with something about her taxes are going to contraception. It's just such a frustrating argument, like I can see if you genuinely believe that abortion is murder, but there has to be some give. It seems that these people don't want to budge at all because they think they are acting righteously and acting out of God's will, which is absolute and nonnegotiable. it's completely back and white reasoning. You either have to accept that contraception and sexual education are away of preventing abortion or at the very least put money into aid and programs social for parents and their children. You can't just ban abortions, make affordable/free contraception unavailable and then just leave these people untaken care of. Because if I know one thing as an absolute truth, it's people are going to fuck and continue to fuck and nothing is going to change that. This whole chastity belt birth control is such an unrealistic expectation. I hate how the only options typical pro-lifer give these people is to either raise the kid themselves with no support or put it into the adoption system, which is over-inflated and offers no opportunity. This only adds to the cycle of poverty which is already rampant in this country as well as creating an over inflated population.

TL;DR: My grandmother is one of these people and I have to listen to her talk about it constantly and her logic is severely flawed.",1

"Two reasons in my opinion: lawyers and lobbyists.  

1.  Lobbyists are able to keep regulations lax.  Internet/cable is not considered a ""public utility"" and Comcast is not a ""telecommunications company"" which would allow for stronger regulation (even though they obviously are).  If the FCC simply labeled it so, the net neutrality case would have turned out much differently.  Congress won't step in because of lobbyists as well.  http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116222/court-fcc-ruling-will-let-big-monopolies-take-over-internet

2.  Lawyers--There have been monopoly-type cases, but lawyers for the telecoms and other similar industries have successfully argued that there is sufficient competition from other sources (DSL, satellite internet, 3G/4G internet). While not entirely untrue, nothing offers the speed of cable/broadband, so this is a bit of a false comparison.  In any case, the Federal Trade Commission will not go after the telecoms because (1) it will take a lot of time and money, and (2) they will probably lose because the telecoms can outspend the feds on lawyers.

Edit:  If it's any consolation, the feds under the Obama administration will be unlikely to approve the proposed Comcast buyout of Time Warner.",2
