"here is how you're wrong about your first point.  [In Graphs!](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/04/the_economy_of_the_2010_electi.html)

Here is how you're wrong on your second point.  In long winded paragraphs!

The united states was at an unbelievably low level of popularity by the end of the bush administration for a variety of reasons(war in Iraq against the wishes of the rest of the world, promoting the idea of a missile shield that instigates a fight with Russia and goes against our own prior treaties, torture, etc.)  I feel like i don't have to go very far into this first point because it is a pretty agreed upon notion.

When Obama came into office he did several things right off the bat.  He signed an executive order closing guantanamo bay(hasn't happened yet but the step in that direction alone has lightened the mood).  He made plans for an ordered withdrawal of Iraq(its already been talked about so I won't really go into it unless you disagree, but this has been enormous).  Then Obama [addressed the UN Security Council](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/24/nuclear-weapons-un-security-council) in support of a resolution furthering the work to lessen the nuclear armaments around the world.  This was not only in support of a great cause(I know you disagree for some reason, but tell me your reasoning and we can get into it later)  but this also showed the world that the president of the United States actually respected the United Nations again.  

Now we can see the effect of all of Obama's work in lightening the anger around the world at the United States.  Ukraine has announced that it would surrender all of its highly enriched uranium from the cold war days.  There was a joint Canadian-Mexican project to modify a Mexican research reactor so that it no longer produces weapons-grade material.  Russia and China, for the first time in my memory at least, have agreed to substantive talks about Iranian sanctions(China may be in a role to simply draw the negotiations out, but that is something to look at in the future).  I think these are all very big deals and there is no way in hell any of this would have happened under Bush.  ",1
"While I do think that global warming is most likely happening, and it is probably due in some part a result of our carbon producing lifestyle. There is some merit in exploring the other side as well. I think most scientists would argue that to charge ahead with one ""assumption/theory"" while not bothering to explore the other avenues would be somewhat irresponsible. 

Also if you look back at historical scientific data the earth has had its fair share of warming and cooling cycles. 

Also the recent news about the inaccuracies in the UN climate studies as of late don’t do any good to shut the nay sayers up.

I think President Obama put it in the perfect context at his first state of the union when he said something along the lines of “Look, I know some of you don’t believe in global warming or the science behind it. However, even if you don’t believe in it, why not support the growing sector of renewable energy, it creates jobs, and offers alternatives to our reliance on foreign oil.”

If you think about it, it works, I mean so what if a decade from now we found out global warming wasn’t human made, can you really say that all the good science that comes from all this research is a waste? I doubt anyone would argue it in that way. Oil is finite, so we will have to do this renewable energy thing sooner or later.

"Never been to the States but I'll get there someday. I am from northern Europe from one of those semi-socialistic countries most Americans can't figure out if to love or hate. Growing up I always heard how great the US was in between listening to American music and watching tonnes of US movies, sitcoms and soaps ergo I've always felt that I could relate to you guys and your culture. Back when the US was our guardian against the big, red Soviet Union a vast majority of western Europeans adored the Yanks. I think we kinda understood that the bad things you occasionally did around the world fell into the category ""It's a shit job but someone has to do it"" so we were generally fine with it. The Americans were the good guys and everything was just swell.

Then the Soviet Union collapsed and everybody ran around confused looking for a new world order which to this day still isn't settled. Europe grew back together (although we still see the eastern Europeans as a bit off but it's getting better) and we felt as if a huge burden had been lifted from our shoulders. The European Union grew stronger and as a natural result the need for big brother across the pond faded. That is basically where we are now although we still feel strongly about our cultural and historical bonds. Most of us want the best for you guys and that's also why during the last decade more and more people have begun to shake their heads and think ""What the hell is going on over there?"" 

I think things really took off when Gore ""lost"" the election to Bush on some very dubious actions. Remember that many European countries have electoral systems very different from that of the US, under those systems Gore would never have lost. It was mindboggling. Here are some of the things I dislike about America as of 2010. Some are perceived and some only refer to certain partitions.

- The lobbying system
- The influence of religion in society and government
- The out-of-control corporate-consumer system
- The general lack of empathy towards the poorest
- The amount of guns and how easy it is to access them
- The lack of interest in the World outside of the US (getting better)
- The hardass police and their methods 
- The fact that you could elect a bafoon like Bush and then re-elect him
- The blatant disregard for the threats of global warming (improving)
- The fact that so many Americans have 2 or 3 two-ton cars.
- The fact that the US jumped on Iraq and Afghanistan on questionable grounds and without clear goals resulting in the chaos we've seen the last 5 years.
- The fact that so many Americans rant about Obama because he is a democrat and black and plenty seem willing to do something about it.
- That so many Americans watch the ""Fair and Balanced"" utter crap that Fox lets out on a daily basis and that a fathead like Glen Beck can muster a 6 digit number of people for his rallies.

I think it bugs many Europeans that you seem to have so many issues these days because we still see you as allies. Unfortunately you've gone from the likable first cousin to the slightly off uncle that the family members always dread inviting over for Christmas.

&gt;The issue here is not the big bad socialists

I'm not interested in straw men arguments here.  I've stated twice in my previous posts that I have nothing against socialized medicine or socialism in general.  I just don't see it as the only solution like Obama, Pelosi, and Reid do.

&gt;you see anything other than unregulated capitalism as socialism

No, I don't.  Repairing our capitalistic system is merely one alternative to government-run healthcare.  Please don't put words in my mouth.

&gt;And by ""fix"" you mean get rid of regulation, right?

Just a bit ago you said I see unregulated healthcare as ""socialist"" and now you are trying to imply I want to deregulate healthcare.  So are you calling me pro-socialist or anti-socialist? I can't tell.

But to answer your question, no.  The government can take an active role in promoting the entry of more competitors into the market.  The start of which is to pass the anti-trust bill you previously mentioned.

&gt;Consider person X who buys insurance. They get sick on day 364 of the policy. Clearly the insurance company will not renew that policy.

I grew up in Chicago and it was always a tactic to pull your enemies as close to you as possible.

"Obama seems to be governing exactly the same as I would have expected a Hillary Clinton presidency would have. The differences are that she would have only had the cautious support of progressives from the start, rather than optimistic support (with Obama, the letdown is much more painful because he sold himself as something he is not).

Also, the Clintons know where the bodies are buried in the Democratic party. There's a possibility she could have twisted arms in the party more effectively than Obama has.

There is an additional liability for Obama in the nature of opposition from the right. While I feel that in most cases, it's too simplistic to call outright racism, Obama was a relatively unknown element in national politics up until '07 '08 where Hillary was a well known figure since the early nineties. Hillary would certainly be called a ""hardcore leftist"" by the Fox News set, but it would be harder for them to paint her as the next coming of Karl Marx or the Black Hitler or having ""no birth certificate"" or any of those other things that anyone with a grasp on reality finds ridiculous. It would just be the usual whining about her being a member of the Trilateral Commission or her hanging out with the Bilderburg Group some weekend, possibly the reincarnation of the Vince Foster murder.

* ""Oh man there's a lot of data here. Do you feel like reading all that data? Didn't think so.""

"These people are following *two* great American traditions.  
Number one is the tradition of red-baiting.  
   
Since 1917, when our elites became afraid of having our own Bolshevik style revolution our people have been conditioned to believe that anything even remotely resembling communism is ""**evil**"", not just ill informed or potentially bad... evil. We have spent our nations resources killing communists since that time. In 1917 we spent money trying to overthrow the soviets.. the depression put a stop to it briefly and in 1935 we finally *recognized* the USSR as a real country. But, in 1947 with the truman doctrine, we were once again busting ""red's"" skulls in. Our last coup attempt on a leftist leader was only in 2003, unless we had something to do with Honduras (which is doubtful, except that the only people in the world to recognize the new Honduras government are Republican congressmen.)  
  
Number two is the tradition of conspiracy-theory and paranoia.    
  
Somewhat related to #1, tradition #2 goes back much further. It starts with what right-wingers today refer to as our ""christian roots"" that our country wouldn't exist for today without. In the 1770's among religious communities there was, as there always is, a sense of impending apocalypse. Used to the advantage of our founders, the ""anti-christ"" of the day was King George III of England. A very good illustration of this is in the U.S. Declaration of Independence: the last section of the document lists a redress of grievances with the British government. The interesting this is that the aforementioned problems are directed at the king of England, **not** the British parliament who had actually been responsible for the stamp act and others issues our founders had. This was an intentional move in order to sustain the fears Americans had of George III being the root of evil/anti-christ, and the impending apocalypse.  It was a way of simplifying a problem in order to give it public appeal.
  Fear of the impending end of the world is common in almost all religious cultures, especially in Christianity. But when you add to that the suspicion of conspiracy, then you have America's favorite past-time. Conspiracy-theories about the moon landing, JFK's assassination, 9/11 are just very recent manifestations of the same trend that has been happening throughout U.S. history. The most common thread amongst these is that they all occur during tumultuous times.   
   
Health Care is just another red-baited issue, brought up by reactionaries and simplified to no end. Even before Obama was elected he was the current ""anti-christ"" for our ""the end of the world will be in the immediate future crowd"". Which in the popular ""left behind"" series has been combined with the Right-wing conspiracy theory of the 1990's of the black-helicopters and fears/fantasies of a one-world government(the U.N.).  The idea that Obama is going create a ""government takeover of medicine"" is simply too juicy of a simplification to ignore. All the elements are in place to create enough fear and paranoia over Obama, the right-wing would be foolish to ignore it.    
  
This is not a new development in American politics, if anything this is the same pattern of American reactionary politics that only a few politicians have ever been able to overcome.

"&gt;There is no requirement that every single post must be made with entirely gender-neutral pronouns so ...those who might be gay, or bisexual, or non-sexual can't find a way to be offended if they are looking for reasons.

No one is asking for this. Do you honestly not see a difference between asking for OMG EVERYTHING MUST BE COMPLETELY NEUTRAL SO NO ONE CAN EVER BE OFFENDED and asking not to be called a bitch or a whore?

&gt;I entirely agree that we shouldn't allow misogynism or disparaging comments about women, but we also don't need to swing the other way and allow the tyranny of the minority - forcing everybody to tiptoe on pins and needles to try not to treat women in any way differently.

I'm sure you know the reason that America bashing ramped up after 9/11, it's not that there wasn't a massive outpouring of sympathy, there was, yet it was squandered by a bunch of cynical, opportunistic, greedy men. They had a pre-existing agenda, which seemed to dovetail a little too nicely with the situation they found themselves in.

Slushfunds and kickbacks and whitewashes, repression, violence, secret imprisonment, erosion of rights, domestic and international spying, wiretaps and blatant bald faced lies spewed forth from the heart of American politics... The public seemed to sleepwalk along, ever ready to be galvanized by yet another cynical invocation of ""9/11"".

The people of the world that love freedom, used to see America as a beacon, they loved America.

I may have been really young, but even as a little kid i knew there was something special about the band and there was magic in the air. my username however is really to convey my contempt with whats become of the dead scene since he died. i went on tour for a short time after highschool. i loved it for the first six months. dosing up, listening to some of the greatest musicians the world has ever seen, listening to stories the old heads had to tell about the way it used to be, it all really taught me alot about myself. over time though i slowly opened my eyes and became jaded. i realized the reason the old heads used to only tell stories from 20 years ago and not last week is because last week didnt matter to them or anyone else anymore. the shows (and the lot especially) were about nothing more than money now, the sense of community and love that i felt when i was just a little kid at those concerts is gone, all i was left with was an empty terrapin shell of what used to be. ive boycotted weir and lesh since the obama rally in 08 (they got paid 50 grand EACH for that show, back in the fucking 70s 80s it wouldve been done at cost).

- all the parties are constantly blocking each other. nobody has over 50%, so you need coalitions to push things through, and coalitions can never be radical enough to put through some drastic, but necessary, reforms unless it's too late.

That healthcare reform that Obama pulled off in just one year (or, unfortunately, partiot-act, or many other)? Impossible in many democracies.

In New York City there were riots. The poor hated that the rich could buy themselves out of the draft. The rich did not want to go to war because the southern planters owed them money they felt would not be returned. Each side believed that they were the ones with God on their side. And it goes on and on. Yale has a great course on the Civil War up on Youtube.com/edu. 

While there are issues I am passionate about and will not budge on, we are, Glen Beck's predictions not withstanding, a long shot away from being close to taking up arms and killing our neighbors. (outliers, the mentally ill and other fringe elements exist, yes, but while the most vocal amongst them makes the news, they are few and far between.) 

Remember too that while Health Care reforms prospects look bleak today, we're 1 year and three days into Obama's presidency. Don't expect change to come over night. Expect it to come in fits and starts mixed into a steady trickle. 

If things truly get bad, it's more likely that we'll see changes to the system than a shooting war.

But for an issue like this, you have to consider that it will be more difficult to remove it than it was to get it in place. The programs will pick up momentum, and if things go well, then Obama will be re-elected, and it will be a non-issue. To get rid of it, a majority would be needed in both Congrass and the Senate, to push the bill through, and then a Republican President to not veto it. Of course with a large enough majority, the veto could be ignored, but this is a rare circumstance.

Politics will stay the same. Liberals want to be socially progressive, conservatives, rather than citing the bible, will go to plan B and cite the good old days of the 50's

Scientific research will stay the same as it is today. Religion has minimal impact on science these days. Guess people will cite embryonic stem cell research, but people have used secular ethics to argue against that as well as religion. Besides, Obama gave the go ahead and most Americans are still religious.

Art and entertainment will probably stay the same. Religion really doesn't have much negative impact there anyway. When they do protest something, their protests usually fall on deaf ears, and the art gets shown anyway. We might have less censorship, assuming our morals somehow change when we lose religion.

"&gt; I don't know - I was kind of asking you, since you made the assertion.

Well, to start, reread my post. I was just throwing out speculations, not assertions. That speculation was based on my informal observations. I don't watch much television, but my parents do. I'll be over for dinner and they'll be watching TV. I'll comment on the lies and misrepresentations hoping to get them to see past the surface. If they have Fox News on, I can't hardly keep up with the propaganda and I end up skipping lots of the lies. Sometimes, my parents will put on MSNBC (probably hoping I'll STFU), and I still find plenty to call out, but not nearly as much.

In general, this experience maps to most of the conservative and liberal media. I find the liberals argue more from facts and the conservatives argue mainly from fear and emotional appeal -- often supporting positions detrimental to the vast majority of the population. I think journalism has greatly degraded as commentary has supplanted reporting. 

Here's a specific example of bullshit: the Juan Williams brouhaha. Williams violated the terms of his employment contract with NPR through his voicing of a personal opinion on a sensitive issue. NPR forbids this to maintain the  professional integrity of its reporters. What is not reported now is that in 2009, Williams publicly referred to Michelle Obama as ""Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress"" on Fox News. (Stokely Carmichael headed the Black Panther movement in the 1960s.) He should have been fired then, but was given a second chance as long as his association with NPR was never more made public on Fox. Williams made the same contract violation twice within about a year.

Now, Williams' fellow employees at Fox News have used his firing for cause as an excuse to call for defunding not only NPR, but also PBS! First off, NPR receives no direct Federal funding. (Remember, neither did Acorn.) NPR claims less than 2% of its income is derived from indirect federal money, probably from the competitive grants awarded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. (BTW, all but one of the board of directors for the CPB were appointed by G. W. Bush and approved by the Senate.) Second, just what does PBS or the CPB have to do with the Williams event? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Yet the conservatives have now made them fellow scapegoats. Do the conservatives report the facts on Williams' firing? No, they play to the public fear of Islamic terrorists, making Williams out to be the victim. A victim with a cushy new $2 million job with Fox, awarded for twice violating his NPR contract. It wouldn't surprise me if Williams and Fox contrived the whole situation as a ploy to attack their media rivals.

Will the liberal media investigate and report? We'll see, but if they don't by today, they may have missed their window of opportunity to save the relatively cheap public asset of nonpartisan, non-corporate controlled media.

I'm glad you like me :) However, is it necessary to say that you're a girl? Cheapshot for karma imo -.-

**See, I was born in the heart of the Bible Belt. I'm the only daughter of two very conservative Republicans, and I was raised in church, with conservative values and political views.** 

Well that sucks.

**I see people in the Blue states and think ""Wow, those liberal liberals are at it again."" but for the most part, I try not to judge.**

Examples? I'm guessing you're talking about social issues, in which case, social conservatism stinks. If you are Republican, then you are against gay marriage, for discriminatory measures to fight immigration(Arizona ID bill), etc... On the other hand, if you are a conservative, and have legitimate qualms with some liberal policies concerning the government, then make sure you're consistant. For example, pro-war and anti-health care reform have contradicting philosophies. A conservative should always be anti-war, and being anti-war is simply un-Republican :P

**I respect what you believe (or don't believe), so maybe you can respect what I believe; God says ""Judge not, lest ye be judged.""**

First off, the bible says that. Secondly, I respect peoples belief aslong as they don't infringe upon me. When people bring in their religiously-derived social conservatism into the government, I cause a shitstorm.

**Political and religious views aside, I totally get your sense of humor. Almost everything I read here makes me laugh. I've not yet been offended (and if I see a thread I think might make me a bit squeamish or upset, I just don't click it). I want to hug the grammar nazis alot.

Being pro-weed legalization is so disconnected from the Republican platform it's insane. At least apply the same logic in your drug legalization argument in every other aspect of your life. Being a conservative is fine on reddit. Being a Republican nowadays is an entirely different issue altogether.

**I'm working on a degree in IT security, have been told to listen to music on pitchfork, but since I don't own a TV, I don't really watch many of those popular shows that are frequently mentioned here. My next vacation might be to Iceland. I’m a Christian, bacon-lover, and have never watched Fox News on TV. I’ve donated to the United Way, bashed digg, and never bought into the swine flu hype.**

I don't watch TV either. Although how do you know if CNN is worse then Fox News? A CNN segment being posted on digg or reddit happens once a month at most, while Fox News is featured daily.

I love drama over the internet too. Now I must weep for the 10mins I wasted writing up this post that no one will read. I'm also Canadian, so the clusterfuck that is the politics and religion in the USA have no effect on me. Lastly, I downvoted this thread because it screams karma-whoring.

"[Most up to date summary from the NIH.](http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/2009guidelines.htm)

What guidelines are you looking for? Prior to Obama's presidency, federally funded research institutions were not allowed to make use of certain cell lines (mostly embryonic stem cells,) although privately funded institutions could do whatever they wanted. 

However, President Obama issued an executive order soon after taking office which loosened this restriction considerably (but still left it up to the NIH to decide whether to allow federal funds to be diverted to research using embryonic stem cells). You'll have to read the linked page in more depth, but a quick glance looks like embryonic stem cells that are obtained in a way that results in the destruction of an embryo are still ineligible for funding; embryonic stem cells obtained in ways that don't destroy the embryo are eligible for NIH funding.
Privately funded research remains unrestricted in this regard.

"I voted for Nadar. Is your ""guarantee"" still right? The options are very limited in the US. I have a feeling that you are going to say Nadar did with no evidence and conclude that Ron Paul didn't and therfore, on thoose grounds alone, I should of voted for Ron.

There occasionaly are neo-nazis that run for political office, who I'm sure get no corporate support. Are you trying to tell me you'd vote for the neo-nazi over someone that received substantial corporate support, like Obama, on thoose conditions alone?

Edit: Your point proved my point however. You really HAVE to be in the pockets in order to make it in the political landscape. Of course there are exceptions, but the vast majority HAVE to be in order to make it or have a huge amount of public support without corporate campaign contributions, which is very rare. 

&gt;There are PLENTY of candidates that are NOT in the pocket of corporations - voters simply just do not support them.

What does that tell you? It should show you that being in the pockets of corporations is the way to get elected in the US system.

Both Mccain and Obama were in the pocket of corporations according to you- the two candidates that stood a chance at presidency. Exactly my point.",2

I'm not a conservative, but I feel that his awful failure specifically was, to fail to understand that he no longer has to appease anybody, he's the freaking President, and that office has amassed incredible unilateral power, and he should have stepped up and used that to undo many of the outrages perpetrated in this country by the Bush administrations.  But no . . . still appeasing.  Sometimes I wonder if he fears for his or his family's safety and that's why.  But he was elected to stand up and to take action and he didn't.  Even when it seemed he was, like regarding Guantanamo, in the fine print it turned out he wasn't.  And this health care program?  Absolutely unaffordable to a huge part of Americans, but Congress never has any clue on what's actually affordable--questions like that aren't their problem.  I love Obama as a human being and I'm so pleased and relieved to have a gentle and intelligent man in the White House after so long.  But if I could speak with him privately, I'd tell him:  Man up!!

"I'd like to point out that VT would have gone for dubie if it hadn't been for Burlington (not really truly a part of Vermont), and a few other towns like Brattleboro (practically Massachusetts).

I'm sort of in a weird situation in that I'm a native VT-er, a bit of a redneck who looks forward to those 16 days in November more than any other time of year, but also mostly liberal in my political beliefs. Most of my friends are obama-hating hicks, and while I was rooting for shumlin this election, a different part of me was sort of hoping that the dubie would win just because it'd be representative of the traditionally-conservative native vermonter population out-voting the transplant population. (kind of sick, I know).

Among the group of people I've grown up with in central VT, the belligerent proud redneck attitude has only been fueled by the increase in flatlanders either moving here or coming around to sight-see.

It is the democrats that are the only ones left supporting Obama, and we are ticked off because all Obama got from a 60 member senate was a watered down healthcare bill and a bunch of stimulus that was laden with tax cuts that the republicans done seem to acknowledge.

I postulate that this is incorrect because the state Courts can rule on the Constitutionality of laws.

"&gt;You need to learn some reading comprehension. The term ""marginal tax rate"" has a very well-accepted definition, but you continue to ignore it. Yes, Obama wants to let the tax cuts expire on the &gt;$250k tax bracket. That would be in line with his campaign. If his preferred plan passes, the amount of money you make over $250k will be subject to a higher tax rate. The rate assessed on the portion of your income less than $250k will not change.

What part of what I said makes you think that I don't understand this? The net gain of my two new contracts will be almost negligible because the gain in income will be taxed at a higher rate. How can you not understand this?

&gt;While I doubt that figure, it's irrelevant. There are three big items on the Federal budget, none of which existed in 1910: Defense (we weren't a superpower), Social Security, and Medicare. Which would you like to cut, and why?

Everyone is shocked by that number but it's true. Almost half and it does not include all of the government in our lives. When you factor in State and local spending it does go over 50%. 

I want an amendment of the constitution that limits the Federal governments spending to 10% of GDP. That way the only path to more power is through growing the economy and strengthening the dollar.


The Federal government's role should be the following: protecting individual rights, defense, treaties, and the federal government has a role in preventing harm to citizens by force of fraud. All the rest is left to the states and the people.

&gt;Personally I think we'd do best to wind down Social Security, extend Medicare to everyone, and slash defense spending by at least half, including ending all operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that didn't pass muster. 

Defense spending could be way less than half if we only defended the country against actual attack and closed the borders. Federal Social Security should go away and I have a plan for doing that if you are interested. Medicine is all fucked up and I have a plan for fixing that if you are interested. I suspect you are not interested in either so I will leave you with this: The idea of redistribution of wealth is a complete failure.

"Yes and Yes. Initially no one really paid attention to Tea Partiers because well let's face it it was racist old white people who were pissed about Obama being black. Their initial movements were just rallies were they touted around racist signs and complained about the bail-outs.  The exact same bail-outs Bush stated back in September of 08. 

Then came the health care debate which gained interest because the tea parties were showing up in force at town halls just basically screaming at Republican politicians to fix something.  The republicans instead of ignoring the tea party started to embrace them, because basically the GOP is going to hell in a handbasket.  Just read anything about Michael Steele the ew GOP chairman and you'll find that other GOP leaders disagree with him over the most pedantic issues because he's black. There's a obvious rift and the GOP knew they had to embrace the tea party even though lets face it its a fringe contingent of bigots becuse they were already mobilized and starting to gain a foothold (for some god forsaken reason)

So yes, Republicans embraced the tea party to get votes. Tea Partiers are bigots who got invited to the big dance to be appeased and divert the issues. ",2
"Actually, I agree with everything you said, and I have no interest in reliving the past -- I was just pointing out that your point about growing up and losing your pride is bullshit.  And it is.  Immigrants who came here through Ellis Island for a better life took an enormous amount of pride in this country because they could get that through hard work.  Today, you know what group seems to have the most American pride?  The illegal immigrants, of course.  They're the hardest working, most optimistic bunch among us.

And by the way, what is ""pride in one's country""?   I'm proud of our people.  We've built the most amazing companies the world has ever seen -- most recently tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google.   I'm proud of our country's fast response to people in Haiti and, a few years ago, the Tsunami victims.  I'm proud that we have a pill for nearly every disease and the best healthcare money can buy (key word is money).

I'm ashamed of our government.  Our government has raped the coffers of what we've built.  Starting with the income tax,the federal reserve act and social security, it only really ramped up in the 1960s.  Kennedy's and Johnson's Vietnam War which truly built up the military-industrial complex, Nixon's opening of the cheap Chinese import and removal of the gold standard, Reagan's defense spending, and Bush's illegal wars.  Now we're witnessing Obama's administration continue to rob the future through enormous deficit spending.

No, I'm not proud of that.  But as a people, I think we've overcome a crapload of awful legacy (slavery, as someone pointed out)  to have the pretty damn good society--literate, well-fed and fair--that we have.  The fact that we have corporations today that call out China instead of just trying to make a buck (way to go Google), is a really, really good sign for our future.

That my position on government is to have a very guarded trust to no trust instead of full faith in the system.  So therefore I see a conflict of interest given the patriot act and Obama's constant support for the unconstitutional wiretapping.

Not the same thing.
Drawing affected religious extremists, instead of the average sane Muslim, who doesn't care about drawings.

Hate to say this. But as much as freedom of speech is a good thing. It should also be condemned in some cases. If someone threatens to assassinate President Obama, they would rightfully be monitored and if necessary taken into custody. Thus, some things are not and should not be put under the guise of freedom of speech.

"Yes. There is a fundamental lack of historical cohesion in the United States.  The story of the West (settled by outside individualist pioneers with nearly unlimited resources) is not the story of the East (former British colony, revolution, historical center of 'culture' and 'money' and 'government').  The story of the South (agriculture, slavery, lost) is not the story of the North (industry, density, won).  Texas clings to its heritage as an Independent Republic, as another example. The last states to join the Union were admitted just 50 years ago.  Arizona has been a state for less than 100 years.  And so on.  

For the United States to function properly, the people of the United States need more time, more common history, and more concern for each other. And I don't know if that's going to happen. 

I think of myself as being pretty civic minded and politically aware.  However I live in the Northwest and as far as I'm concerned the rest of the country can go fuck off (particularly the Supreme Court and Scott Brown-electing-Massachusetts - thanks a lot assholes!) and leave us the hell alone.  Dunno if that's going to happen though.  If I feel that way, I can't imagine that some backwater tea bag moran is going to be any more magnanimous.

I like my Senators a lot, and my Representative in Congress is great.  When I look around, I see people from other parts of the country that are screwing up MY healthcare.

Obama talked a lot about rising about petty politics, working together with republicans to make a difference, etc.  He also promised a lot of reforms that simply weren't going to survive trying to cooperate and compromise with his political opposition.  Health care reform no going well certainly hasn't helped his approval ratings.  He tries to keep some of his more ambitious promises, but also tries to compromise when political opposition appears.

You're radical, they're radical, chill out, calm down, people aren't shooting each other in the streets, like they were in my father's country only decades ago.  Politics in the United States as a whole are the hindrance of solutions.  Our government is built on corporate bureaucratic bullshit on either side.  It's just a big business, and both parties are for it, this big business, big government, big money thing.  Just one wants gay marriage, and the other doesn't.  I'm not saying there isn't a religious undertone to it (which more or less violates the Constitution,) but a lot of people simply vote a certain way because they're neighbor told them to, or someone is has a better speech writing ability, or someone is their former senator.

This whole system needs a reform, new parties, new perspectives, new solutions to issues still plaguing us as they have been for several years.

In short, nobody believes that an American soldier would not be within his rights to kill Al-Awlaki if his life was under immediate threat (in the middle of a firefight). But the Obama administration is claiming the right to kill him on sight, regardless of what he is doing. This is a complete circumvention of the legal process.

Also, the U.S. is trying to have it both ways with regards to his membership of Al-Qaeda. If membership in that organization can be deemed membership in a foreign militia, then by their own logic we are absolutely violating the Geneva Conventions, and by extension the U.S. Constitution which makes any treaty signed on par with the highest law in the land, by holding members of Al-Qaeda indefinitely, without trial, and torturing them.

I also have to disagree with you regarding Guantanamo Bay. Those prisoners were placed there essentially by fiat by President Bush. Obama could just as easily close the facility.

The United States is no more retarded than it ever has been.  History tends to ""forget"" things like Congressional elections, The Tea Party, etc. as historical blurbs, rather than real problems.

Congress has always been corrupt.

Congress has always hindered progress.

The Supreme Court has always legislated along partisan lines from the bench.

The disenfranchised have always had to fight, screaming and kicking for their equality.

Businesses have always been favored by Congress, except for periods of extreme populism (see: Great Depression, new financial reform, etc.).

The difference is the amount of exposure that we get to it from the internet, coupled with (I think for most people on reddit) coming of an age in which we start to pay attention to politics.

"There are nearly 4000 oil platforms in the gulf. The first was built in 1947. These platforms survived Katrina without incident. There are accidents and explosions fairly frequently but none have resulted in a catastrophic spill until now. The platform blowing up and sinking and the blowout valve failing is the most unfortunate coincidence in the history of oil production. 

BP did not do this on purpose to commit corporate suicide.

The Obama administration had just announce more drilling in the gulf and along the eastern seaboard in areas that had previously been closed. I do not believe that the government would cause this disaster because there is no upside for them.

Obama's announcement of new drilling was a slap in the face to two groups. Apec because more American domestic drilling decreases their market share and limits their ability to set prices. The announcement also affects environmentalists for reasons that are obvious now.

The oil problem was two simultaneous failures - platform blowup and blowout valve failure that struck one well out of 4000.

a) Tragic coincidence (likely)

"(Part 1)

&gt;I don't even want to waste the time correcting you since your information you receive is clearly filtered (read: too much time on /r/politics). To be blunt, you are ignorant. I'll spend a bit of time trying to explain to you why are you correct before I go to sleep because it's 5AM here.

Ugh. Whatever.

&gt;The democrats have been in control of congress for 4 years now, the wars have not ended.

Dumb. Starting a war is *not* the same thing as ending a war you simpleton. Especially as both countries are now seen (and accepted by america) as america's responsibility. As Powell says, you break it, you buy it. America cannot and could never *just leave*, especially because in addition to having broken it, leaving it like that would be the most counter productive thing to do if their goal is fighting terrorism as unstable regions are the exact kind of places that terrorists come from. Bush got america in there, and america is *stuck* there and for me to have to explain this says a lot about your reasoning ability. Listen to yourself  ""The democrats have been in control of congress for 4 years now, the wars have not ended."" lol. Ridiculous.

&gt;What makes you think the democratic base is any less nationalist or racist? 

Southern strategy. ""Bush's campaign manager and Chairman of the RNC, held several large meetings with African-American business, community, and religious leaders. In his speeches, he apologized for his party's use of the Southern Strategy in the past. When asked about the strategy of using race as an issue to build GOP dominance in the once-Democratic South, Mehlman replied, ""Republican candidates often have prospered by ignoring black voters and even by exploiting racial tensions,"" and, ""by the '70s and into the '80s and '90s, the Democratic Party solidified its gains in the African-American community, and we Republicans did not effectively reach out. Some Republicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong."" [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302342.html]. They even *apologised for it*.

&gt; They consistently support tariffs and promote a pro-American worker stance, fuck those yellow guys stealing our jobs in China!

Ridiculous. Supporting tariffs and being pro-american worker does not equal racism and i am shocked that you would make that implication. Putting two sentences side by side does not make them connected. Try again.

&gt; They are just as racist as the typical Republican voter, they just dislike white people.

Oh, i see. You're that kind of american. No comment as this is just your  unsupported opinion.

&gt;  Do you really think that the 95%+ black votes went to Obama had nothing to do with race for example?

So? What are we arguing about again? Look, it is one thing to have a party policy that exploits racism whether subtle or blatant to get white votes and it is totally another thing to have voters themselves vote for a particular candidate because of his race. The former is by a *party*, the latter is on the *voters*, unless you can show that democrats exploited their race (ie the white republican candidate enslaved you in the past!!!!) then you bringing this up is just baffling. Can you honestly not tell the difference??

&gt; The thing is, thus far governmental involvement in the health care industry has not helped, medicare/medicaid had a very low projected cost but they've ended up costing ten times (or more, I forget the figures) than they were projected they are to, as most government programs do.

Is you argument govt. involvement has not helped or it is costing too much? Or both? The former is ridiculous, did you not see elderly people during the townhall meetings shouting ""keep your govt. hands off my medicare""? The latter is **true** (see, i am not above admitting that). But so what? It can always be made cost effective. Improved. If you say it has not helped then **you** are the ignorant one. Before Johnson signed it into law, people over 65 could be made *destitute* by almost any semi serious health condition. These are unemployed elderly people whose retirement  savings could be wiped out almost overnight. Have you ever even researched why medicare was passed??

&gt; Why do the tax cuts matter, fuck taxes the majority of the money is never used for anything fucking useful other than warfare, welfare, entitlements, and federal thugs.

I only mention tax cuts because republicans run on a platform of fiscal responsibility and harp on about the deficit. Then they turn around and offer tax cuts worth to the top one percent.

&gt; There has been far more financial regulation than deregulation, the only deregulation you can really point to is the repeal of the Glass-Stegal act which is hardly the cause of the financial crisis. In fact, a large majority of the financial crisis (read: housing bubble) was caused due to government intervention in the economy such as Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac/artificially low interest rates/community reinvestment act/propagating home ownership/etc. That isn't to say the banks aren't at fault either, it's one big fucking mess and you can't conveniently create a fucking boogie man and say ""HOLY FUCK ...

Sorry, you cannot just dismiss it by saying ""the only deregulation you can really point to is the glass steagall act"".""The potential to make enormous profits trading mortage-backed securities with artificially high ratings encouraged banks to take on otherwise intolerable risk in the form of bad loans. The ease with which people were obtaining home loans drove an artificial housing boom that exacerbated the inevitable return to earth."" It *was* one of the major factors that caused the financial collapse. The very reason why it (the series of acts) was put there *in the first place* was  **because** it was the exact same behaviour by the banks that was partially to blame for the crash of '29. And they *still* were against financial regulation even after the fact.

&gt;Happens to Democrats, why do you think this is even relevant?

I mentioned why, it is because the republican party is home of the ""family values"" politician. And part of their base is the christian right. Hence, hypocrisy. Do i really need to explain this?

&gt;I won't defend this, but the Democrats have made absolutely no progress in this arena either. In fact, Obama has stated he does not support gay marriage.

Good, it is indefensible. Obama is not the democratic party. Hahaha. Wait wait. ""Democrats have absolutely made no progress in this arena either"". ou sly dog you! Our argument is not which party has made progress on gay rights or not! It is which party has a rigid anti gay stance to appeal to their christian base! Nice try though. Next time, don't change my argument.

&gt;Pretty equal on both sides. If I recall correctly, on average Democrats are more poorly educated than Republicans (less high school graduates). It was in the 2008 presidential election stats

Once again, reading comprehension has failed you. Or is it reasoning? I don't know. Listen, *learn to differentiate between a party and it's voters*, okay? The republican party is the party of anti climate change, anti stem cell research (to be fair, this is probably more a moral issue due to their base), it is Sarah Palin denouncing wasteful spending on fruitfly research,  it is Sen. John McCain calling the expenditure of $3m to study the DNA of grizzly bears ""unbelievable"", it is Bush saying we should ""teach the controversy"" when it comes to creationism or evolution...Writingin the New York Times, David Brooks noted correctly (if belatedly) that conservatives' ""disdain for liberal intellectuals"" had slipped into ""disdain for the educated class as a whole"".

"Rhetorical questions i suppose. The answers seem fairly obvious to me. Political ideology doesnt come into it.  The larger (in numerical terms) the minority a candidate emerges from, and the less likely that minority is to vote under normal circumstances where there are two white candidates, then the bigger the boost to the party which selects a minority candidate. Obama must have got more first time votes than any other candidate in history. Black people who would not normally vote did so purely because he was black. He didnt have to campaign for these votes, didnt have to spend money in these areas, they came free and easy. 


Every minority candidate would enjoy similar benefits, but to differing levels. ""Asians"" are split between chinese, koreans, japanese, vietamese etc. Lots of small groups with different religions, languages, cultures. Also not concentrated in large numbers within geographic areas. The number of mexican-americans, by far the largest constituent of the Latino demographic dwarfs each of these niche communities many times over. Even other, much smaller Latino communites have the benefit of a shared language and religion.


Therefore, it seems obvious that a Latino candidate is more likely to be selected and elected than an Asian. Far more prospective candidates, and far more cheap, easy votes to be gained from their own demographic",2

The Holocaust museum is also interesting, if a little depressing.  The American History museum and Natural History museum are both interesting, especially if you're interested in their respective subject matter.


The WWII memorial is very nice, although it's nicer in spring/summer.  The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, as well as the Washington Monument, are other obvious choices.

It's not Obama's fault, but it's certainly not the fault of Democrats any less than Republicans.

We privatized the gains (back when Fannie, Freddie and the rest of the failed companies were making money) and socialized the losses (now that they're not). Big surprise when it repeats next time. Oh my huge company isn't going to fail, the government will bail me out. It's guaranteed now.. 

When the government supported giants, Fannie and Freddie, crashed, everything else crashed. Look it up. All the major crashes came after Fannie and Freddie except one.

"Here's where I pipe in.  I've been working at [MSFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Space_Flight_Center), and here's my 2 cents.  (Feel free to correct me if I'm off)

The proposed FY-2011 budget has called for the cutting of Project Constellation, it's associated Ares I and V vehicles, and the Orion capsule.  Basically they're planning on taking a step back from manned space-flight and refocusing NASA's goals to more of a science and technology center.

Obama's budget is actually **increasing** NASA's total budget over the next five years, once again for the advancement of science/tech and other programs.  

NASA and it's budget are directed by the executive branch (w/ congress approving the $'s).  Budget cuts, changes in programs, and changes in overall goals are the unfortunate result of being tied to a 4-year cycle of elections, and (in general) each president likes to have his *own* agency.

Here's where i get a little political:  Bush loved his 24-hour news cycle of fame when he announced ""to infinity and beyond"" (or was it to the moon and beyond... ?)  But then, he proceeded to cut our budget for the program every year for 3 years.  The budget (post-Bush era cuts) was no where near the amount the project needed to succeed.  Ares V was put on a shelf to be addressed later... The new Lunar Lander wasn't funded... and Ares I barely squeaked off a test fire in Oct.  (See [Ares I-X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_I-X))

"Ok, Millenial here, 17 year old to be precise.  Here it goes:

Dear Holy GodFuck!  How did everything go so wrong?  What the hell happened?  I mean, from what I know, everything wasn't too bad by the late nineties.  Fair economy, good pace of technological progress, relatively peaceful world.  I don't remember too much back then, but I do know that for most of 2000 was fairly optimistic, and that people were looking forward to a nice millennium.  Certainly not one free from problems, but definitely on the up-and-up since the Cold War, at least. 

Then came 9/11, and it seemed like everyone, literally *everyone* to my tiny 9 year old mind, went completely and utterly batshit crazy.  Suddenly, it seemed to me, everyone decided to blow shit up, whether literally or diplomatically.  For a while it seemed like it didn't really matter, like we would be done with Afghanistan within a few months...and then we weren't.  We invaded (or ""liberated"", or what have you) Iraq.  As time passed, it seemed like everything started to erode in the world, like everyone was starting to get more and more pissed off at each other.  The election of Obama restored a bit of my faith in the state of the world.  Still, we seem to have more problems than we can shake a very large stick at: There's Iran possibly going nuclear, Israel acting like a dumbass, North Korea remaining insane, our own social security teetering on the edge of failure, the economy as a whole stagnating, our political system becoming (or remaining) corrupted, our criminal justice system remaining ineffectual, and the ""War on Terror"" that seems doomed to continue despite our best efforts.  

I understand that some of those problems are probably inflated, but still, it seems like my generation (undoubtedly like yours) has been left with a big bag of issues to deal with, and I seriously doubt our ability to do so before everything goes to hell.",4

Which means off of income of 400 thousand they have to pay five or six million potentially. Not gonna happen. So they fire all of the employees and liquidate the equipment.  This is basic math and basic logic. Not complicated at all.

As to 'subconscious racism', perhaps you're judging your own thoughts based on some pre-defined standard rather than accepting them and looking at them rationally.

For example, consider these two statements:

* Do you think Barack Obama is a wild eyed coon?
* Do you think a bunch of ghetto looking, ghetto acting black guys talking loud as hell on the bus might be trouble?

The former might be racism.  The latter is definitely not.

"Nice question, very situational. Of course, on ""Family Feud"" everyone guesses Reagan first. I'll go with:

1) Teddy Roosevelt: young, energetic, veteran, Republican but one that appreciated the US as an entire land; an environmentalist that helped establish the National Parks system. 
2) Lincoln: smart, charismatic, and determined to keep the union vs. individual states rights (unlike Jackson, who otherwise I admire). Unafraid to throw massive resources and lives into the effort to keep the south, north, west together to make a great nation.
3) Jefferson: Intellectual and a philosopher. He'd educate the country which is way overdue - science, history, math, English. Probably with tolerant libertarian ideals side by side with understanding of human desires and failings.

"Mostly that the lower and middle tiers of officers aren't particularly encouraged by what goes on over there.  Lots of distrust and lack of confidence on the part of the Americans, who seem to believe the Afghan government is inherently corrupt.

Also, American troops believe that elements within the Pakistani government have been actively providing support for the Taliban.  This is made even worse by the fact that the US sends a lot of money and material support to Pakistan.  You could easily conclude that the US is helping fund a fight against itself.

The implications of the American distrust of the Afghans are mostly political.  It's awkward for American officers to try to build relationships and trust with their Afghan counterparts if said counterparts know the Americans don't trust them.

The implications over Pakistan's supposed support of the Taliban are a bit harder to discern.  Keep in mind that this was all known intelligence and opinion for the US government, but they kept dealing with Pakistan anyway.

Obviously, the Obama administration must have believed they could pressure Pakistan into changing without publicly playing the ""we know you're involved"" angle.  I'm not sure how it changes anything for Pakistan to know that we believe they are culpable.",1

There's such a fine line in relationship dynamics that I believe both partners have to be extremely successful and independent long before they meet each other.

The problem with that is men are still for the most part looking for partially intelligent trophy wives and women are marrying up.

"Every candidate for a state or federal office (cities, counties are exempt) must create a legal entity to manage their campaign. The entity has only two sources of income: 1) Up to $X from the candidate's personal wealth 2) Contributions from the state or federal government. Government contributions are received incrementally based on submitted voter signatures. Signature drives can be done using money from 1) and individual volunteers. Signatures cannot be accepted from any legal entity other than the campaign.  Y signatures gets you Y*Z dollars. Y is capped at W% of the eligible voters.

"That's interesting. Those prices are higher than I thought they would be. These are my gringo numbers:

You can find rent in a US city is usually around $600-$800 per month, but it won't be the best part of the city, and it might not be enough space for a family. Purchasing a McDonalds meal can be done for about $4, but if you want to eat something you can actually live on you'll end up spending at least $6-8 per meal (in a US city). Homecooking costs vary immensely. Some couponing stay-at-home parents can do a full shop for very little indeed, but working a full time job I find it hard to live on less than $300 of groceries per month, and that's me being both relatively careful and having an occasional splurge.

Cars seem to be the same price, and I agree with the other commenter that people that can do without one should. Still, US public transportation, with a few exceptions, is terrible. Most of my friends bike everywhere, and the american public transportation systems I know are bike-friendly (which is great!). But not free: a monthly transportation ""pass"" will cost you about $100-$200, depending on where you live. Nonetheless, if you have a family, carrying groceries around becomes difficult without a car, especially if you don't live close to a grocery store (a frequent problem in poor areas). But there's a good used car market, and you can get a decent one for about $5000, or at least I did. Car insurance (which is required here) starts at about $500 per year. If you're healthy, you can find health insurance for about $150 a month, but god have mercy on you if you've had even one bad health incident within the past few years. Hopefully Obamacare will fix that. 

The other big expense, here, are student loans. They're ridiculous. Since high-schools are relatively terrible many choose to take on some more education at $5,0000 to $30,000 per year. And if you choose it, there's grad school, with similar prices. There's still quite a lot of scholarships, but they hardly cover all of it. So it's easy to end up with $500 or more per month of student loans that you have to pay for 30 years.

Assuming you have student loans, that's about $2000 total a month on the low end, if you're being reasonably smart about things. And assuming you don't go out at all.",56
"Interesting...

Also, I disagree with you on the mudslinging and shitting-on-your-opponent thing. Reddit may seem like that, in that many Democratic Redditors post things like, ""look at what the Republicans said/believe!"" However, the thing is, Democrat VOTERS do that.

You're getting too vague and hypothetical for me to comment realistically.  Why is it necessary to have armor in Portland?  What's going on?  What else has been tried?

&gt;I've heard plenty of Army dudes calling for gays to be killed, and even so for Obama. 

You've also heard about (if you've been paying attention, that is) about plenty of Army dudes who don't give a shit about gays, or even welcome the end of DADT.  There are also plenty of Army dudes who voted for Obama.

&gt;I don't think it's as black and white as you try to make it.

Are there gray areas?  Sure.  Is the average American grunt as eager to shoot a fellow American citizen as he is to shoot an Afghan insurgent?  Absolutely not.

It's far more likely that the US military would balk at a mass suppression of the US populace.  I think after a few days of seriously trying to enforce a political movement, the US military would collapse.  Discipline would evaporate, desertion would skyrocket, and after a month or so there'd be nothing left recognizable of the former organization. 

&gt;I don't think, given the circumstances, USA would react any differently than Poland if tanks were to drive around it's cities for 2 years time to prevent an invasion from a much greater and dangerous power.

It's really tough to make this comparison.  The US doesn't have Solidarity fighting the United Workers Party for control of the government.  There is no USSR sharing a contiguous border, mumbling about Hungary in '56 and reading through the Bratislava Declaration looking for inspiration.

I'm not looking down my nose at Polish troops - I don't want you to get the impression that I'm saying the US military is somehow morally superior to the Polish military of 1980.  I'm just saying the situations are different, and the respective militaries have different institutional memories and underpinnings.  In addition, the two societies we're talking about have/had different stresses and histories.

"No.

You think the Republicans would be questioning the location of Obama's birth if he were white?

Or look at the Teabaggers and their racism: http://blog.reidreport.com/2010/07/tea-partier-mark-williams-writes-open-letter-to-lincoln-from-the-coloreds/

Or ask yourself why, since 12% of the US population is black why there aren't 12 black Senators?

Or why the man who murdered Oscar Grant got off with involuntary manslaughter, wasn't even arrested until two weeks after the crime was committed, etc.

Or why the Republicans are making political hay out of the lie that Obama ordered the DOJ to stop investigating allegations of voter intimidation by the Black Panthers?

Why cocaine in crack form (preferred by poor blacks) carries a vastly heaver sentence than cocaine in powder form (preferred by preppies)?

"Well I would. I have a couple of different reasons for including that one.  

Firstly I'm not confident that Obama will win reelection.  I hope he does, but things are really strange politically lately and it seems to be less certain.  If he doesn't win again then things are shaken up quite a bit.  I'd add to this that whomever does defeat him stands a good chance of being a one-term president as well, since the defeat will come out of this aforementioned strange political tenor that is in place.   Under these circumstances, any of the next three elections could be won by a female candidate.

If he is reelected, then some stability will have returned to the system, and in that case I am predicting a likely female president to come from the 2016 elections.   It seems more likely to me that it will be a Democrat, though I wouldn't say who I think it will be, except to say I don't think Hillary would run again.   Whomever wins in 2016 will likely be reelected in 2020.

"Over the past couple of years, the medical marijuana industry in Los  Angeles has exploded. Estimates vary, but there may be as many as 800 dispensaries currently open for business in the city of angels. An ordinance recently passed by the LA city council, however, is about to change all that.

The new ordinance will force hundreds of dispensaries to close and all but a few to relocate. The goal was to bring clarity to the medical marijuana industry, but the only thing that's clear is that the transition process will be difficult. Especially now that the DEA has begun raiding dispensaries again despite the promises made by the Obama administration.

While federal, state and local governments struggle to make sense of medical marijuana laws, an increasing number of Californians support a completely different approach: marijuana legalization. Nothing more than a pipe dream? Maybe. But consider this: Fixty-six percent of Californians currently support pot legalization, the same proportion of Californians who voted for the Compassionate Use Act, which legalized medical marijuana, back in 1996.

"I've done 4 years in the Navy stationed in Hawaii. I enlisted shortly after 9/11 cause I couldn't stand sitting on my ass and doing nothing about it. I left for boot camp in July of 2004. Well I've been out for almost 3 years now. 
The time I was in it was awsome. I mean I was shore duty living in Hawaii and only working 15 days a month and lived a block from the beach. 
Realizing that I was ganna be stuck in Hawaii for 4 years with no deployments I decided to voulenteer for 7 months in Africa with the Marines.
  This was a the best idea ever! An experiance I'll never forget and am glad I did. Can't talk a whole lot about it but I can say a few things. 
While I was aout there Senator Barack Obama flew to Africa to show his support for the troops ( I say senator becuase at the time he was only senator and hadn't announced his running for presidency yet). So he came out and asked if anyone wanted to play basketball with him. Long story short.. we all balled it up and Obama schooled us all. Afterward we all smoked a cigarette. ( Obama included). Stand up awesome guy.
Lets see after I left Africa and flew back to Hawaii. Me and several other service members were invited to have breakfast with President Bush. Of course I jumped on that. So we all ate breakfast and it was a dandy ole' time. I wanted to have something I can chalk up on my ' what I've done list'.... So when it was appropriate I asked the Presidnet over to my house for a barbeque.. ( You should have seen everyones reaction, not to mention the ear full I heard/ applause I got after the breakfast). Bush laughed and asked what I was cooking. He said ""if your cooking ribs I'll come."" Well I waited and waited for a blackhawk to land in my backyard so Bush could come eat with me... again. And well.... he never came... 
That was my experiance with the military",3

"To answer the original post:

 No, most Americans just vote the way they're told and have no passion for their countries stability or growth. All they truly care about is having more than the next guy, plenty of food and cable TV. That's about a third of them, the rest is divided between the extremes of both major parties and moderates. War and religion twisted into a Gordian knot and somehow our economy got sucked in with it. Not our proudest moment.

Most Americans don't care about history and in the past 30 or so years we've been conditioned to instant gratification and politics is no different, we expected as a whole for Obama to swoop in and rescue everyone and conveniently we ignore the interference of the opposition party, churches and extremist organizations without holding them accountable.

We got what we deserved, sorry if you  in Europe and Asia got dragged into the mess.

"Before I answer, I'm going to start off with this. Your questions seem very loaded, and you have an obvious pre-existing bias towards the US. If you're going to ask this, you should try to be a bit more open minded then you seem.

* From what I've seen while living here, people are generally happy. However, I'm not sure how you would really judge that. How can you judge any country and their citizen's happiness? Many of the people here aren't very pleased with our foreign policy, but as a nation we are the highest educated per capita and with great living conditions.

But of course that could be different when you're talking about different parts of the US. (I live in Chicago) But the same could be said about anywhere.

* It is very easy to start a business here. But then again, it is also easy for a business to go under. It's all the luck of of the draw. I feel that it's much easier to get a job here in comparison to many other places in the world. As per starting a business, I'm not entirely sure on that point. Many of my family members have started their own businesses, and they've all been very successful. So from personal experience I guess I'd have to give a yes to that one.

* We have a LOT of colleges and universities here in the US. That's one of the biggest reasons people come here in the first place. Most (if not all) colleges and universities encourage the arts. I know at my university we place a very heavy emphasis on the arts, and encourage it as much as possible.

Overall I'd say it's a great place to be an artist, whether it's musical or other. A very large portion of the world-renown artists that exist today came from the US. It's a great place to get started due to all the opportunities.

* This one is ridiculously loaded, but I guess I'll bite. 

The desperate - It is very easy to find a job in the US in comparison to many of the countries in the world, so I'd say yes.

The intelligent - Obama is putting a very large emphasis on science, and funding is getting easier and easier to obtain. Also, as I said before, I believe we are the most educated per capita due to all of our colleges and universities. (I work at Argonne National Laboratories)

The exploited - Everybody exploits everybody. I don't even know what you want to say here.

The hungry and the needy - We give a lot to our hungry and needy in the US. We have a large amount of organizations that deal in just that, and charitable donations are easy to come by. I often go with a bunch of my friends to soup kitchens or old folks' homes to help out and do some community service.

The US is much more charitable then you would like to believe.

* The radicals here give us a bad face, I understand. The radical religious folks, the radical republicans, and even some of the radical liberals are the ones that get press. But despite what you see on the news, I assure you that it's not bad here. I love it in the US, and I would choose it over most other places in the world. Don't judge a place by what the hivemind tells you.

Hell we all would still be hating Keanu Reeves if somebody hadn't decide to actually check him out. Put your bias aside and give it a chance. Don't let the crazies be the face of our country, they are a very small part of us.

I realize that we are far from perfect; nobody is. We have a pretty shitty healthcare system, and our standards of living could be much higher. We jam our faces into the entire world's business, and through our weight around the  globe for no apparent reason. But if were up to the majority, I don't think this would be the case. I think that most of us here in Chicago lament that it's the crazies that end up in office. I can't believe Bush was voted in twice. It astounds me. But as far as the world goes, we're pretty far up there.",3
"Many of the democrats I have encountered who aren't happy with Obama are upset because he isn't too dramatic and he tries to be bipartisan, actually working with both parties. Yes it would be great if he had the support to just totally steamroll America but he doesn't- and in all honesty, as much as I'd love the guy to be totally liberal and just disconcern himself with any kind of compromise, I respect the fact that he si trying to work with both parties. I don't think he is doing it to try and please all the people at the same time and play the middle field so to speak, I think he is doing it to try and start a new era of politics in our nation- for once, a president who is willing to work and compromise with both sides instead of having them squabble against each other like snot nosed brats, which is what we don't need more of.",1

"I had this exact same feeling a while ago. I tried to pin down exactly why I felt that way, and I realized it was the music I listened to from 1998-2003 compared to the music that I listen to today. 

A lot of people (particularly white people) in their teens and early twenties prior to 2003 listened to alternative rock and different kinds of pop. This was the dominant music from Nirvana to Incubus.

Living in LA I remember a distinct racial divide between the hip hop and alternative rock stations KROQ (106.7) and POWER 106 (105.9).

Almost no black artists on KROQ and few white artists on POWER.

In 2003 a major shift happened in musical tastes - for the first time all of the top 10 songs on the Billboard 100 were African American. This shift had been happening since 2000 in the form of white hip hop artists (mostly now derided) such as Limp Bizkit, Eminem, and Kid Rock (uggghhh). Since then, all kinds of rock music (which started off as a bunch of white artists imitating black R&amp;B singers) have fallen by the wayside among the youth of America. Hardly anyone I know under 18 listens to alt rock or indie anymore, except for people trying to be eccentric.

Today if you talk to teenagers, few actually listen to alt rock. Very few people take so-called indie musicians all that seriously. The last ""rock"" group I truly enjoyed were the Killers.

The major music artist of the past decade (and I know many of you don't care for him) is Kanye West (2004-Present).

The major events of the past decade:

Iraq - Afghan War,
9/11,
Katrina,
Obama elected,
Economic disaster,
2003 Music shift (comparable to 1964 Beatles),
Growth and supremacy of the Internet post dotcom bubble,

Note that three of the events of the above list have to do with shifting racial politics.

The next decade will probably be characterized by changes from the growing Hispanic cohort. Today both POWER and KROQ are mostly deejayed and operated by Mexican-Americans who grew up in Southern California.",1

"Oh how short American memories are.  Obama held an online townhall, last March, where the public voted on questions for the President to answer.  The legalization of marijuana was, you guessed it, one of the top questions posed.  ""With over 1 out of 30 Americans controlled by the penal system, why not legalize, control, and tax marijuana to change the failed war on drugs into a money making, money saving boost to the economy? Do we really need that many victimless criminals?""

&gt;“The answer is, no, I don't think that is a good strategy to grow our economy,” the president said. His answer prompted applause from the audience.
(White House press secretary Robert Gibbs later clarified Mr. Obama's position: ""The president opposes the legalization of marijuana…he does not think that’s the right plan for America.” Pressed by CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, Gibbs declined to discuss the president's position on medical marijuana.)

"Barack Obama. Execution style with a .357 magnum. Also he has to yell ""I am a MOTHERFUCKER!!""",1
It will be another year full of the same shit.  Expect Obama doing big time PR to save his job.,1
Obama was my keynote speaker so I went for the novelty. It was several hours of sitting in the sun but it was probably worth the experience. If it had been anyone else I would have probably stayed home. ,1
"What more did you want Obama to do? 

He laid the groundwork for what will eventually become nationalized healthcare in this country. If history written for the 21st century come from the same sources as the twentieth then Obama will be canonized as hero the same way FDR was. 

Obama is pushing hard to raise taxes in a down economy. Keeping the middle class tax cuts was a concession to Dems up for re-election but it is clear he did not want to do that either. Democrats should be creaming their jeans over this guy. 

He is single-handedly dragging the US into social democracy. Without Obama the US may have turned away from the redistributive death spiral that European nations find themselves in but Obama is assuring that we stay the course until this capitalist freedom nightmare experiment implodes. 

Short of sterilizing all Conservative women and setting Libertarians on fire at political rallies what more could you possibly want Obama to do?",2

...*and* they tend to believe that capitalism every problem...

...*and* many believe that anything that isn't no-holds-barred laissez-faire capitalism is communist/socialist/marxist...

...*and* many believe all of the latter to be synonyms for evil (although they don't know the difference between those three words)...

...*and* many hate Obama with such a passion that they don't want his administration to end up with any wins whatsoever, let alone the kind of win that might make posterity regard him as a great statesman...

...*and* a lot of them seem to be plain and simple prejudiced against blacks (and hold that against Obama)...

...*and* a lot of them seem to think nothing of lying through their teeth, while at the same time apparently believing the straight-out lies they hear from other wing nut conservatives...

And on and on. And some of them seem to be simply nuts.

People laugh or respond politely and then attempt to continue with what they were saying.

In light of the fact that the republicans are saying no to everything, getting this much accomplished is a major achievement of historic proportions.

Reddit is a terribly biased source of political coverage of our country, however accurate it may seem to be. Also, you need to realize that many republicans aren't tea partiers, but they just believe in more conservative political values. Americans tend to vote the same way every election, and when one party takes control, its electorate gets complacent and suddenly the opposite party ends up in control. 

What I expect for the next two years is a huge fucking stalemate, far worse even than it has been recently. It's sad, but true. Democracy, especially in the US, isn't perfect.",1

"Hi Republican here, but before you downvote...

The issue with Carter was that he came off as a guy who said nice things but didn't take action to implement them. That is why a lot of elders looked at Obama as the next Carter - he talks well but can he execute?

'mericans have a problem with academics ever noticed that?  Most of America doesn't respect the professor/teacher communication style. For

"This reform is in the right direction, but needs PO for it to work properly. That is my position. 

I thought PO was in that reconciliation bill, it isn't, but now it might make it back in this week if Bennet proposes it, or it might still make it back in before 2014, when it'll matter. 

But to keep citing that one website as if every single author on there does their own research and are completely unbias is a joke. I, myself, read that bill that proposed the Public Option, and along with those 2 other policies (pre-existing + rescinding) in the HCR, and I felt that is all that is needed to keep the private insurance companies in check. (2000 pages isn't bad, when the font is fucking massive and page tabs are huge, it's like a short novel)

You citing me passages talking about how insurers will still be in full control of the appeals board, etc... means nothing to me. I don't trust any source unless they cite the passage directly out of the bill to support their claim. The fact that they don't, on a website that attracts people who are looking for unbiased websites, is strongly hypocritical, even from you. You guys left other websites for that very same reason, and here you are making the same mistake of committing blind faith to these commentators. You found a website that conforms to your opinions, good job.

The mandate tax appears to be like a terrible idea, but it is the only way to prevent insurance companies from having free reign to pick their customers, and rescind coverage with no oversight. Without the tax, people will just wait until they are sick before they get insurance. This reform would be a complete success if there was PO. However, without it, or without the strong regulations that Switzerland has, the insurance companies will continue to screw the system. But in the end, if they do screw their customers, if they drive hoards of families into debt, THEN heavier regulations WILL come into place. REGARDLESS of what happens, if PO doesn't get through, more price regulations on the insurance companies are inevitable or your economy will utterly fail, and that is not what you, Obama, congress, or the insurance companies want.

What happened before this reform came into place were the deaths of  people because they didn't have insurance. All those 10,000s of people who died every year because of this lack of insurance, will for the most part, stop dying, and will have bills to pay. If this bill is as bad as your website says it is, then price regulation will be inevitable. Then you really will have Switzerland's system. This reform, as the loosely liberals put it, is a step in the right direction. The status quo still had soaring HC costs, but had 10,000s deaths per year; it would be impressive to make the situation any more worse.

To claim that I work for the HI industry shows that you really have no self-made opinions or arguments. You continue to spread the bullshit fed to you by websites that don't cite the relevant passages from the bills that support the basis of their own arguments.

EDIT: All I've been saying is that with or without PO, restrictions on denial/rescinding on private insurance companies, and regulation on these private insurance companies, then you have a pretty good reform. The argument on your website is that there is not enough regulation. What we both accomplished is that there IS regulation, but you guys claim there isn't enough. That latter claim is not shared by me because no one on that website has shown me why, and even if it's true, the forward step of actually putting regulation, even measly regulations, on these companies, IS a forward step, and shows that more steps are inevitable. I think the reason for weak regulations (by your standard) is that no one knows how much regulation is needed. Can you imagine if the government decided to go from no oversight, to complete oversight over the entire process? There is no fucking way that would make it through congress. You can only take baby steps on some issues when they involve heavily sensitive American principles.",1

Granted, he is doing much better than I could (I would probably be in a fetal position under my desk in the oval office, sobbing), but he has not shown much leadership. I was worried about this when he was running for office. The vote for Obama was a very progressive one, but Obama himself is not a progressive. His record had shown him to be a fence sitter and a compromiser. Neither of these qualities makes for a good president. What progressives and liberals need is our own version of Reagan. A galvanizing icon for the movement, and the balls to tell opponents to go fuck themselves. Just my opinion.",7

"Beyond what rugby8man had to say, you are american (spelling of ""humor"").

You like Flight of the Conchords so you have a good sense of humour.

You are late 20's or early 30's (10 years since you had mushrooms). You have a boyfriend and you rarely wear makeup so you are probably not unattractive (and this is where I get to ask if you have plough experience).

You have been to England (where you may have learnt to appreciate soccer a little).

You like to find out about ""life hacks"" (like the stop sign legality) and you like to work this into conversations with others. My guess is that your friends think of you as the one who knows all the answers in a pub quiz.

You are engaged politically, certainly liberal and probably an Obama fan.

You have more than one tattoo. If you got your first one at 15 and don't regret it then you probably have quite a few, with some of them visible in normal dress.

Your relationship with your boyfriend is somewhat volatile but is also, consequently, very emotional.

1. Your dad is clearly a shithead, and you've been forced to absorb his shit for ninteen years, and it has almost certainly warped your thought process in some ways.  It takes time to sort out your worldview when your views have been shaped by emotional abuse thrown at you since early childhood.

2.  You describe yourself as a fuckup.  *Don't be a fuckup.*  That doesn't mean you should become what your family thinks you should become, but live your own life with joy and integrity.  See point #1, and find your purpose if you don't have one yet.

If you live your life as a fuckup, you will naturally find a poison to dull the pain, whether it is alcohol, donuts, porn, or religion.  If you were born to make music, becoming CEO of a bank is ""being a fuckup"".

"Or the even worse ""Hitler was a socialist. Obama is a socialist. Therefore, Obama is as bad or worse than Hitler.""

Wow, where to start? 

1.) Hitler was not a socialist. He did not favor worker control of the means of production. 

2.) Obama is not a socialist. He does not favor worker control of the means of production.

3.) Stalin worked with America in World War II. Nazis and Communists saw each other as threats to their own survival. 

4.) Glenn Beck quotes the ""First, they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up..."" quote often. But he leaves out one line ""Then, they came for the Communists. I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist.""

5.) Have you read any of the works of Karl Marx and do you really know what socialism is? Otherwise, stop talking about that which you have no knowledge.

6.) That begs the question (correctly used). You allege something, then try to prove it with other unproven allegations.

7.) When did Obama round up and exterminate millions of people? Did he campaign, as Hitler did, on such a promise to ethnically cleanse the country?

8.) The Socialist Party of Germany actively campaigned against Hitler. They, correctly, labeled him as a brutal tyrant bent on destroying democracy and replacing with God-like worship of the Fuhrer. They knew he would take away civil liberties en masse and, since socialists usually also favor democratic methods of government, campaigned against him. This backfired when the Socialist Party was outlawed and members were taken to concentration camps along with Jews and Gypsies and gays and other generally ""anti-Hitler"" people.

"I *think* his (their) main point in this rally is that regardless of our worldview, the majority of us basically want to get along and improve our collective, secular, quality of life if possible, and minimize conflict. Thus name calling like 'Bush is Hitler'/ Obama is Hitler' represents useless and polarizing fear mongers who are in reality only a small (but more vocal) minority, and should not be the only voice we hear or lead our decision making.

Obviously what is being *represented* by that minority as the Right is the worst example of this and takes the brunt of abuse from The Daily Show, but voices from the liberals do it as well (Bush may authorized some very bad things, but he didn't publicly institutionalize racism or genocide). Jon Stewart hasn't been shy about openly critisizing the left in a way that, say, MSNBC won't, although he clearly has more liberal-based viewpoints. ",8

It looks like the Republicans are set to take back the House and possibly the Senate, so we're pretty much doing the exact opposite of voting back the same party that almost destroyed America.

Unless you're saying that those people simply choose to disregard reality and idealistically vote for the *concept* of ""having a right to what you earn"", it would seem to me that those people either fall into the ""Rich people voting in their self-interest"" group, or into the ""Ignorant people who have no grasp on policies and who fall for rich people propaganda"" group.",57

"According to the Obama administration's latest tally, the stimulus funded 750,000 full-time-equivalent jobs during the second quarter of this year, as reported by stimulus grant recipients.

But a more comprehensive analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released in August concluded that the real payoff likely is much higher. Taking into account multiplier effects and other factors not included in the administration's count, the CBO estimated the stimulus legislation ""increased the number of people employed by between 1.4 million and 3.3 million"" in the second quarter of this year.

Put another way, stimulus spending helped lower the unemployment rate by between 0.7 and 1.8 percentage points from where it would have been otherwise, the CBO said.

The CBO is a federal agency charged with providing Congress impartial analyses on budget and economic issues.

In a debate at Widener University Law School, Christine O'Donnell criticized Democratic nominee Chris Coons' position that teaching creationism in public school would violate the First Amendment by promoting religious doctrine.

O'Donnell asked where the Constitution calls for the separation of church and state. When Coons responded that the First Amendment bars Congress from making laws respecting the establishment of religion, O'Donnell asked: ""You're telling me that's in the First Amendment?""

The exchange Tuesday aired on radio station WDEL generated a buzz among law professors and students in the audience.

"Effective policy requires compromise, too many voters believed that immediate and radical change would result from Obama's election.

"I didn't compare it to Malaria or Heart Disease because these are not things we can readily control. Yes, living as a healthy vegan will *HELP* against heart disease, but in the end, genetics may fuck you. With malaria, obviously it's still out there, and it's going to kill as long as mosquitoes exist (I'm not sure how else it's spread; I don't claim to be an expert). 

My name: ak49 refers to Alaska (AK = Alaska, 49 = 49th state in the union). Vigilante. Yes, I know. But it's taken from my gamertag, which heavily borrows from a friend of mine, who took the name ak49wastelander (wastelander being a Fallout 3 reference). Would I personally go out executing rapists were it legal? Yes. Do I fantasize about it? No. 

Yes, people practice shooting to get better. But if you've never hunted, and you only practice to be good at it (because it's fun, and because it could possibly come in handy one day), what's the harm? Should society ever collapse and we have to hunt again to survive, because the grocery store goes out of business, you'd want to be a good shot. ""But what if that never happens??"" Well, I didn't hurt anyone, so that argument is moot.

If I'm shooting at inanimate objects (my personal favorite are glass bottles), I am shooting to improve my skill. At shooting more inanimate objects. 

With enough diatribe, you could argue the same thing about violent video games. They teach children to kill, they are training them for mass violence and the more they play, the better they'll get at murder. Well, I don't know how many copies of Modern Warfare 2 have been sold, but low esimate I'd guess 6 million. Have mass murders suddenly spiked? No.

Same with guns. The government estimates 200 million privately owned weapons in this country, yet we average 15,000 deaths per year (I'm not counting suicides, as it would be ridiculous to do such) which equates to 0.0075% of those guns killing (assuming one gun per kill, which is also innacurate) or 0.005% of the population killed (accident, murder) by guns. Yes, I wish that number was zero, but banning guns won't make that happen. If it did, then chicago would have been one of the safest cities in America for the last 30 years (handguns are used a lot more than rifles in murders). 

But back to your point, about what guns can be used for besides entertainment (because Ferraris and Lamborginis have a lot of use besides entertainment) is that they **CAN** be used to kill. That is a **VERY** important point. I'm going to ask you to [please look at this list of genocides from the past 100 years](http://i.imgur.com/ce4TV.jpg). I'm not going to call names anymore, I'm not angry (even though I'm defending one of my hobbies and a way of life), I just want to ask a question, which I guess could be considered emotional: Do you think, that as a society, those people were better off having their guns removed from them? And if so, do you also believe that with said weapons, they would still not be able to put up a fight against their murders? 

The biggest, and I mean biggest, reason that we should own guns in this country, is to prevent anything like that from ever happening here. And yes, I know it sounds crazy, and yes, I know it makes me sound crazy. No, I don't think Obama is hitler. I don't think he's trying to enslave the white people. I think tea-party folks are nuts/racist. I like to think Obama won't pass any gun-control laws. 

No, I'm thinking down the road. No one we have elected now. Maybe not even someone that is born yet. But if we agree to give away our guns this generation, then someone born in our great grandchildren's generation may decide to have a little genocide. 

They are there to stop tyrants from taking control of America, and as long as those guns are there, we might never need them. But once you give them away, you will wish you hadn't. I'm not sure there is ever convincing someone like you that guns are good (just like you could never convince me that guns are bad) but you must at least see that genocide is often prefaced by gun control (and yes, I know that doesn't mean that today's gun controllers are going to try to mass-murder us). 

I just worry about the tomorrow of our grandchildren, and therefore DON'T want gun control.",1

Not to mention that they're ""constantly poisoning the environment with deadly radiation"".  There haven't been any new Nuclear Power plants for like 30 years, and the people in the current power industry probably aren't interested in spending a few billion dollars to make electricity cheaper.

Also, a lot of youth today were born in the boom or early bust times.  I also think that modern history affects how people interpret past history.  In the U.S., Reagan is practically deified by a huge portion of the population today.  The only thing is that he wasn't nearly as popular when he left office.  You can go back and look at the polls.  In 1987, his average approval rating was 48%.  This is pretty similar to Obama today, yet the media harps on how bad this is.  It's selective memory.

However it was a freakin' bookkeeping position. I had no experience in bookkeeping and told them that in the interview but they hired me.

I was supposed to be helping the bookkeeper that worked there, but she quit after the second day that I was there and I was expected to be a bookkeeper do the books for over 20 companies a month all while working under 20 hours a week. The accountant that owned the office would scream at me because I didn't know what I was doing. 

All the clients and the accountant were devout Catholics and uber-conservative. He made comments about how I shouldn't be living un-married with my boyfriend. 

The breaking point was when we started doing the books for a local congressman's campaign. I had to record all of the donations he received and the notes on the checks absolutely disgusted me.

But back to our discussion, the documents leaked by Assange pointed out that Saudi Arabia was funding terrorist cells in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is an ally of the United States because of the oil they have. The US pays Saudi Arabia a lot of money for oil (oil companies in Saudi Arabia, not everyone in the country), the US then uses that oil to fight wars around the world, and some Saudi's take that money and fund the terrorists that are fighting the US. The US are able to use the fear of terrorism to convince their people it is okay to siphon money from more essential services: infrastructure; health care, the US has the worst health care system of any ""Developed Western Power"" and the Republicans coming into power after the elections have stated they are for repealing all the progress that Obama's democrats tried to make; and education. They are taking this money and hoarding it amongst themselves (through ridiculous government contracts handed out to companies with conflict-of-interest ties to politicians and tax breaks for the rich that export jobs). I don't believe all Americans are terrorists, I just believe that the US's foreign policy is indicative of a terrorist organization, getting what they want through force instead of through diplomatic discussions in order for their campaign donors to prosper at the expense of the rest of the world.

""Dear President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder: 

We, as Australians, condemn calls for violence, including assassination, against Australian citizen and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, or for him to be labeled a terrorist, enemy combatant or be treated outside the ordinary course of justice in any way. 

As Thomas Jefferson said, ""information is the currency of democracy."" Publishing leaked information in collaboration with major news outlets, as Wikileaks and Mr. Assange have done, is not a terrorist act. 

Australia and the United States are the strongest of allies. Our soldiers serve side by side and we’ve experienced, and condemned, the consequences of terrorism together. To label Wikileaks a terrorist organisation is an insult to those Australians and Americans who have lost their lives to acts of terrorism and to terrorist forces. 

If Wikileaks or their staff have broken international or national laws, let that case be heard in a just and fair court of law. At the moment, no such charges have been brought. 

We are writing as Australians to say what our Government should have: all Australian citizens deserve to be free from persecution, threats of violence and detention without charge, especially from our friend and ally, the United States.

Well, firstly, I think he's doing enough that he will still have a relatively decent base of states to rely on, i.e. the solid Democrat states which are more or less every state that voted for John Kerry (to summurise, that's New England, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, DC, New York, New Jersey, all of the mainland West Coast states, Hawaii, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois) which all add up to 251 electoral votes, meaning that assuming he regains all those states (and I believe who won't have much difficulty in doing so), meaning, with only 19 votes needed to win the election, his struggle won't be as hard as you might think. Now to make up the remaining votes he'll need about three small states or just one big one (like Ohio but they're always to close to call). I think he can count on Iowa, seeing as he’s been very good to him since they gave him the primary, so now we can add 7 electoral votes, meaning he now only needs 12. In the last election his failsafe was Iowa along with New Mexico and Colorado, which are both worth 5 and 9 respectively which would put him at 172, a close victory, however, their support will not be so certain until just before the election. Upon looking at some other swing states, it is quite evident that many can’t be even guessed at this very early stage except one very interesting state, Virginia. A solid red state since Nixon’s first election, demographic changes have made and will continue to make this state very winnable for Democratic candidates, especially one who can pull such a high number of African American voters. The main reason for this is that the hyper-Democrat DC suburbs have expanded far enough into Virginia’s North to grant it enough Democrat voters to make the state winnable. So, another victory scenario could be the solid blue states, Iowa and Virginia.

Now, electoral votes aside, one thing which will certainly help Obama is the GOP’s difficulty in finding a candidate to match the cheer character and personality that is Barack Obama. Nicolas Sarkozy is extremely unpopular in France, but he is certain to win his next election because his rivals, the socialists, will more than likely not be able to find a candidate to match the character of Sarkozy and the French always like a strong character, even if they hate him. The point I’m making is that the Americans are not far off (unlike my nation’s unbelievably capacity to vote boring idiots to office). If you look back, the most charismatic man won, JFK beat Nixon, Reagan beat Carter, Clinton beat Bob (zzzzzzz) Dole, Bush beat Kerry and Obama beat McCain. So, unless the Republican Party can find someone that is good enough to steal Democrat states, let alone steal them from the most liberal President in years, Obama’s chances are pretty good. 

**tl;dr**: He'll probably win if for nothing else than the fact that the Republican party is in more trouble and even more unpopular than he is.",1

Do i agree with how politics in this country work? no, I'm just telling you why his support base turned on him.  Which is exactly what you're seeing now everywhere and especially on reddit.  What you or i think SHOULD be happening is meaningless, discussing what is is ideal for the American people to think about their president is meaningless.  **The reality is that unless he acts like he is working towards what his constituents wants, they're not going to vote for him, and compromising is obviously NOT what the people want, thus the backlash**  In the next 2 years, Obama could continue to play mediator for both sides, in which case, i will guarantee that many people who showed up to vote for him in 08 won't be appearing in 2012.  Or, he could act like an executive and start pushing his agenda without playing mediator.

It really wouldnt matter if we didnt know their history of never calling a mixed race person half black. WE know exactly wtf they are trying to do.

another thing which isnt quite bigoted but she said that black people only voted for obama cause he was black.  Obama had several rallies of over 100k.. mccains biggest was less than 20k. Bush was shit and everyone, even murdoch was thinking of voting dem. Obama got one of the largest popular votes in history. To single out blacks when all races voted for obama in majority numbers is either ignorant or bigoted. I will give her the benefit of the doubt on this and just say she is ignorant.

but yeah I write out the entire word nigger when talking about the word nigger.

and last... can I say the word cunt on the radio if I am not calling anyone a cunt? somehow I think some folks would still be offended.

It really isnt her use of the word that offends me, it is her overt bigotry and the fact that as a bigot she uses the word.

as for blacks using it, the oppressed will often use the words used to oppress them as their own. It is a way of acknowledging to each other that you both have the same place in society. That doesnt make it right when outsiders say it.

"It's hard to take a post seriously when you riddle it with provably wrong talking points.

Let's start at the top. This is not a government takeover of health care. In fact, the left *wanted* a government takeover of health care, it's called a single payer system and it works great in countries all over the world. It consistently provides a higher quality of care for lower costs. You may still be against this, and that is fine, but when you call what just went down a 'takeover' you sound alarmist and, most importantly, you sound like you don't even know what's in the bill. This brings us to the mandate:

&gt;Medicare/govt health insurance doesn't pay full price, they pay a % of the quoted price - this is part of why health care costs so much.

Agreed. The idea behind the mandate is that we spread the cost so a small amount of people don't have to pick up the tab for others. Now, I disagree with this strategy because I don't think the bill does enough to keep prices in check, so what we have is a situation where the insurance companies will just be getting forced subscribers while nothing is being done to strongly regulate how they treat them and the prices they charge. How would you address this?

&gt;I don't know about you, but there is too much going on in DC behind 'closed doors' that we hear about after the fact.

Please elaborate what you mean by this using specifics.

&gt;Deals were made that are either unconstitutional (govt mandate of insurance) or just downright lies (Pres O's exec order to not fund abortions - a President cannot affect laws via executive order).

Just because you say something doesn't mean it's true. What part of the mandate is unconstitutional? Can you site precedent? With people dying because of lack of insurance, couldn't it fall under the 'general welfare' clause? As for abortion, the same applies. What you said is untrue. Read the bill and see how abortion is handled. Also, please provide the executive order you claim exists.

&gt;Stuffing a provision to make the US Govt supply the student loans (instead of just subsidizing and underwriting them) into a bill on health care doesn't make much sense, does it? wtf do student loans have anything to do with health care?

It doesn't. This happens all the time unfortunately. This has been common in Washington for decades. I don't see why this is a valid criticism of the health care bill. If this is an important issue to you, I would push for it separately and in circumstances where it is used in something you favor, it makes you seem more honest when that happens. I am behind you 100% on this cause. I think it's something that all people, no matter what political views you hold, could get behind.

&gt;There does need to be changes made to the health care system - but we as a country need to do it responsibly.

Logic fail. You assume that anyone who supports this bill thinks it's irresponsible. Do you think it's literally impossible for someone to consider this bill with all its pros and cons and think it's a responsible way to move forward? This is another talking point that makes it seem like you don't care to learn anything about this. I am against this bill, but obviously the people for it think it's a responsible thing to do.

&gt;We can bring down prices by limiting damage amounts on malpractice suits

Talking point number one for the GOP and this has been addressed time and time again. The fact that you still bring it up shows how little you care about the actual debate. Tort reform is a good idea, but even the most optimistic studies show that it will reduce the costs by less than 5%. This is not nearly enough to put it as a main argument for bringing down soaring costs.

&gt;I wish I'd have known the child psychiatrist I sent my daughter to was gonna cost me over $600 for an appointment that lasted not 45 minutes!

I love this point because it completely betrays your ideas. Why not ask next time? Is it illegal to ask under Obama's plan? It's called 'personal responsibility'. Do you want a government telling doctors what they have to say? Isn't that putting a law between you and your doctor? Consistency, my friend, is a good thing. Seek it.

For example I don't need to stay on top with any celebrity news because my mother and sister will always inform me when Lindsay Lohan is in or out of jail.  My father will inform me of what white, Christian, Republicans are currently saying about Obama.  And my friends will keep me on top of the latest social and economic issues by discussing episodes of Family Guy and South Park with me.

"I see a lot of blatant misogyny, slut-shaming, and gender double standards on reddit. Not only does reddit hate feminists, I'd say a good percentage of redditors seem to hate *women*.

That said, there are some things about feminism that I have a problem with. Feminism has, for whatever reason, come to mean something represented by white middle-class college-educated women in the US and Europe, and does not represent people working for social justice in other parts of the world, so I'm primarily talking about white American feminism here.

I think they have a belief that it's OK to be a dick if you are an oppressed group, or that being a dick is actually a good thing. Anger and subjectivity, which would be frowned upon in any other discipline, are considered appropriate in feminist studies. There is a lot of dogma and groupthink with people repeating the same ideas to each other until they are treated as axiomatic. Some feminists are remarkably deluded to the point where they insist that transgender women are more privileged than they are, or that one should vote for a pro-war establishment woman (Hilary Clinton) over a liberal man (Obama). White feminists, with their anti-family, anti-community bent, do a terrible job of dealing with the interests of women of color or women elsewhere in the world, but they don't always recognize that this disengagement is their fault, and the way to fix this is to be less hateful and less narrow-minded.

Many feminists do not have the above problems, but enough do (including very high-profile people like Steinem and Bindel) that it is a real problem.",4
"1. Standards of success being within those acceptable in scientific testing are also ""not strict enough"" for Randi. He does not allow for even 1% variation from pre-stated target results.

Is trying to get people together a bad thing? no, is alienating your supporters because you want consensus rather than conflict going to affect your popularity among those people? yes.

"Unfortunately for all of us... not really. I feel like the word ""communist"" is like the word ""communist"" from the 50's - still referring to a typically ""white"" ideological construction, whereas the word ""terrorist,"" I think, if you'll forgive my coarseness, is more akin to the word ""nigger,"" as used in the early 20th century. The difference:

If you're a ""communist,"" we have a trial and get you ""blacklisted.""

If you're a ""nigger,"" no ones going to care if we hang you, regardless of your guilt in whatever we blame you for. 

Essentially, the term ""communist"" is still deployed in a political context (we can assume that it subsumes terms like ""socialist,"" ""fascist,"" etc), i.e. - ""Obama is really a communist"" (ways to rectify this - impeachment, obstructionism, etc). The word ""terrorist"" is deployed to talk about someone ""outside"" of our legal/political structures, someone who is able, without question, to be kidnapped, tortured, killed, indefinitely imprisoned, whatever we (in a rhetoric sense)  ""need"" them for. i.e. - ""Omar Khadr is suspected of terrorism, and that's why we've held this Canadian in Guantanamo Bay since he was 15 years old... six years ago.""",2

"I think you misunderstand me, somewhat;

My initial assertion was that, Obama could have been promoted as the first mixed racial president. He wasn't, arguably to pander to voter perception.  Mixed race wouldn't have sold to the young, or the minorty vote. I also believe that his mother has been downplayed significantly, for the very reason that he needed to be perceived as 'black' by his voters.

As for context, I am fully aware of the white dominated media, and the underlying reasons behind ethnic festivals and parades. I do not have any ill feeling towards their existence, or right to exist. I don't have issue with BET. I do feel that there has been a lot of overcompensation made for injustices of the past, and all US caucasions have fallen under the term ""whites"". In that context, a person cannot embrace membership in that group in the same way a person can embrace being a member of the ""black community"".

I spent a large portion of my early life in relative poverty, in predominantly black neighborhoods. I have no hatred for any ethnicity. I am not looking to come across as a white supremist. I have lived and played with blacks, and latinos. I know intimately what it feels like to be a minority.

I also have a pretty decent insight into the underlying cultural values of these demographs. If Obama had not been perceived as ""black"", he would not have had the black vote. If Obama had been presented as interracial, or mixed race, he would not have appealed to young white voters, who have been brought up to feel that embracing ethnic diversity (specifically black diversity) is more important than cultivating a society that is fair for all. 

Obama's campaign was engineered to seduce as many voters as possible. His image was groomed to connect with as many voters as possibe. The result is this: In the US, half black = black. that is why I am irritated with his title as the ""first black president"". Obama's personal views on his identity are irrelevant. He is the ""first black president"" because the majority of his voters are most comfortable with that.  (I am aware that all presidential campaigns are like this, and that is another rant altogether).

*""Let me ask you something? I'm the mayor of a town...you come to me and you want to ""celebrate white heritage"" tell me what are you going to propose to me that isn't done for the other 364 days of the year?""*

I don't feel that white heritage needs a festival, or celebratory event. I do; however, feel that there should not be shame in feeling comfortable and proud of one's heritage...regardless if you are white. There should be no shame, or guilt.

Additionally, I wanted to compliment you on your succinct, and well thought-out response.

"There's a website that one university made that allows you to compare different cohort groups in different countries. The summation was this. In Europe, you have a slightly better chance of reaching old age due to the ease of attaining checkups, preventative healthcare, etc. In the U.S., you have a much higher chance of reaching 95 once you get past a certain age.

That's also why universal healthcare isn't going to cut costs unless we dramatically decrease care for the elderly, which ain't going to happen while the boomers still have breath in their body. Something like &gt;75% (I'm spitballing here. I don't remember the exact number.) of healthcare costs occur after 65 (spitballing again). In Europe, you get a moderate amount of healthcare for your whole life, but you have a dramatically more limited range of treatment past a certain age. You have a much higher life expectancy in the U.S. when you are old. Call it what you want—maybe it is more realistic to cut our losses—but the people who are being sold on universal healthcare (elderly) aren't willing to make those cuts.

The result is typical. Any reasonable tax for healthcare would have had the young paying the least for obvious reasons (less likely to use it, lower salary, etc.) and the middle aged paying the brunt, but AARP still got Obama to limit it to merely 2 times more. The result is that Obama's healthcare plan will result in a massive disproportionate burden on the young, who are already getting screwed by a poor job market. The boomers want everything: the kind of dramatic end of life extension care that they are used to now but at the cost of European universal healthcare.

You're free to look for my source. I actually posted it a year or two ago to /r/economics, but I'm not going to hassle my self by looking it up.",2

"It has nothing to do with guts. There is only one person right now who is the president of the united states. Words are cheap when you're not in the position to actually do anything, that's why bush fucked everything up so spectacularly, he liked to talk and didn't care that his words actually meant something.

Obama's party is criticizing him for not pulling a bush and just ""doing things his way"" but what they don't realize is this solves nothing. Please the liberal minority of your voters and guarantee you don't get reelected while also destroying any credibility in the democratic party. Give the conservatives and republicans a huge % of the vote next election because the entire conservative/moderate public will say ""wow Obama didn't even care what we thought"" **AND** when they're back in office they have an excuse to say ""we're gonna do whatever we want because that's exactly what the democrats did."" At least Obama's administration is trying to restore political order in congress instead of just making everything even more partisan.

He's taking the road that makes him the bad guy in everyone's eyes but it's really just the public getting the medicine it doesn't want to take. Conservatives are going to hate him no matter what. Moderates are going to wait for him to do something radical so they can say ""whoa Obama, too far"" (remove troops, DADT) and liberals are going to bitch he's getting nothing done.

In the 2000 and 2008 elections both winning candidates lacked the support of nearly 50% of the voting public but apparently just winning means you're supposed to ignore that and do whatever the fuck you want. Bush did that and now almost every problem that is headline news is a remnant of his administration. It's a lot easier to fuck something up than to fix it.",16

"You're welcome. It's a good question. In some ways, the link I provided is an under-representation of what Obama has accomplished, given that it looks only at campaign promises. For example, in her [interview with Jon Stewart](http://www.indecisionforever.com/2009/05/15/jon-stewart-interviews-epa-head-lisa-p-jackson/), EPA head Lisa Jackson remarks on the fact that most of her time during the first few months of her term was spent undoing Bush-era environmental deregulation.

"I was talking about the draft metaphorically.  Putting them up on a stage and letting the white owners go after them and lock them into contracts.  They then have to move to wherever the team is and leave behind their extended families.  Sure they'll have riches for a few years but most file for divorce within a few years of retirement and most are broke a few years after that.  

Unfairly imprisoned yes.  But what most people don't understand is that when a crime is committed against someone, the police are required to bring in any suspects in the surrounding area matching that description to be identified.  So if you say a black man robbed you, they'll bring in every black guy in a  block area they can get.  Now, let's say you're a black guy a couple blocks away from a crime and you have some weed on you but you weren't involved in the crime, tough luck.  Of course, I agree with Bil Cosby and Obama on this, it's not entirely the system's fault.  In my scenario above, which I've seen happen, while the other people didn't commit the crime in question, they were committing a crime. 

On top of all that, if you've ever been in charge of hiring someone or have dealt with that, then you know all the incentives for hiring a minority.  Even people don't fill out a questionnaire asking them their race, a good recruiter will look at activities to see if they were involved in a black fraternity or community group.  

Bottom line, with anything else in life , if you want to succeed, you gotta make it happen.  The system could change, but it's not going to educate you any more than you educate yourself.  Drug offenses might get lighter penalties but you still shouldn't be carrying.  Put yourself in a position to succeed.  It's like they say in Poland, the best way to succeed is to just not drink. ",1

Really? So who provides this universal healthcare? It's not government?

Because insurances can't do things like reject the people with pre-existing conditions. So if you have terminal cancer and want to sign up, you can. Also, all the sudden everyone by law must be a customer, so why not jack up the prices.

&gt;also, it strikes me as odd how an additional burden for the taxpayer can arise if medicaid doesn't need to step in all the time.

Medicaid isn't becoming smaller, it needs to step in just as much as it ever has. Second, how can this increase debt and burden on on the taxpayer? Because lets see... you know that health care you're getting? Well the doctors, the pharmaceutical companies, the hospitals, none of them are working for free. So the government has to pay for it.. With whose money?

&gt;# No, ""your"" economy wouldn't be ""worse for a while"", in fact, the worlds economy would break down completely for quite some time. Think civil war, famine, post-apocalyptic scenarios. I highly doubt it would even come to that, because even the stupidest dipshit of a republican would backpaddle as soon as he's been wondering where to fill his tank for some days. But it would cost enormous amounts of ressources to recover from a post-no-bailout scenario.

Yes, a few companies that basically already failed, we just bought their debt, failing is going to cause a post-apocalyptic scenario. Someone [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dj2ys/conservatives_can_do_without_a_god_but_they_cant/c10km9c) said ""In order to convince the masses to go towards a certain direction, one must scare them into thinking that any other option is catastrophic.""

Huh? I said show me proof that Obama is doing something for green energy that's above previous president. You have not. Second, I said that even if he does invest in green energy more, he's cut other important fields, like NASA.

&gt;I don't like a strong government either, not at all, believe me. But until people start seeing ressources, humanism and respect for the environment and each other as merits valued higher or at least equal to money on a broad basis, I see little hope for that happening. To me, a nerd as a president is like a good meal in the trash.

I can't believe you when in one line you say one thing but in another, you say another. You support universal healthcare. Thus you are a believer in strong government.

"Well, as one of those Redditors you are referencing, I will tell you that I see Buddhism as a philosophy of life, not so much as a world religion. I am actually very anti-religion, yet I still have a way of meditating, and understanding our universe in a metaphysical way, through Buddhism, that no study in science can match. 

Many people who are religious (Christian, Jewish, and Muslim), still consider themselves Buddhists. The Buddha himself, and all of the Dalai Lamas, never considered themselves gods, and the thought behind Buddhism emphasizes the idea that there is something much greater of which we are all a part of. This seems to be lacking in modern Western religious teachings, which was, I believe, the original premise of the teachings of the founders of these religions.

Now, imagine if Barack Obama met the Dalai Lama, and a tiny iota of this thought rubbed off on the president of the most powerful country in the world. Just maybe, it might happen, and if it doesn't, oh well, back to square one. It's not about theocracy or power, it's about a oneness which can bring the world together. I am not afraid of living in a Buddhist run ""theocracy"". First, it would never happen, and second, if it hypothetically did, what adverse effects could possibly happen?

And in regards to some people thinking China as having some sort of legitimate claim to Tibet; that is like saying that England has some sort of claim over the USA. Yes China administered Tibet's foreign affairs in medieval times, but most of China's religious thought comes from Tibet, during those medieval times when the Emperors of China imported the monks of Tibet to teach them about Buddhism.

In regards to the martial law in these posts: This was the norm all over the world during medieval times. The Dalai Lamas, most notable the 5th Dalai Lama, were seen as uniters of Tibet, not theocrats. They had a governing body to oversee the affairs of the state. In no way did they ever condemn someone to death or to be tortured or mutilated. This never happened. The bureaucrats who ran Tibet in ancient times, were the ones who had say over life and death. The conventional view that history has of Tibet is that of a country who fostered a spiritual path to enlightenment, which had been administered and protected by the Mongols, and then China, in order to further their knowledge of spirituality. By protecting Tibet, these countries, were given the gift of Buddhism.",2

Obama and his running mate Senator Joseph Biden won the presidential election[9] after 23 months of campaigning that spent over $700 million,[10] much of it raised from undisclosed or fraudulent donors.[11] Obama spent far more per vote than McCain did: Obama spent $7.39 per vote, while McCain spent only $5.78 per vote.[12] Claimed by liberals to be a brilliant orator, Obama depends completely on reading from teleprompters when he talks, even in an elementary school.[13] ",3

"We are creeping up into Police State.  This has nothing to do with Obama (anymore than any other president) and has a lot to do with wars on drugs, 9/11 attacks, etc.  Basically, any ""crisis"" is an excuse for the government to come in and promise security in exchange for some rights.

For instance, you can't even travel the country anymore with a few grand in your pocket, without, when being stopped, have the police be able to confiscate it without cause.  Then you having to ""prove"" it's not drug money.  Often, it's takes more time and money than it's worth to fight it -- and police are finding confiscation more and more profitable all the time, especially in this economy.

Before you ask what you would be doing with a few grand, there are people who conduct legitimate business who need cash on hand (think American Pickers) or it may be your winning from Las Vegas/Atlantic City.  It really doesn't need to be explained until the government makes it a sin.

I've been through East Germany while it still existed (as a little kid) and a few other unsavory countries.  America is not a full blown police state yet, there are many countries worse than us, Britain tops it for western countries imo, but all this happens by degrees and we're well on the way to 1984 imo.

""Large"" transactions (10K+), travel, credit cards purchases, etcetera are all track but it's under the radar for most people and the government does a good job hiding it from you.

Another example I heard in an argument was that someone once mentioned how in a country in Eastern Europe, people always had to register with local officials and he considered that Orwellian.  Well, my dad is a landlord for a small house and every three months, he has to send in a detailed list to the township of who is living there -- all without the tenant's knowledge.

The township has gone so far in recent years to conduct a ""safety inspection"" that costs $70 in every rented residence, where they peer into every room of the place.  This is a standalone house, not some subdivision or apartment building.  They don't even give the choice of the tenant checking off his own fire alarms, etc.  I consider that an invasion of the 4th amendemnt.

A few things that come to mind immediately:

  1. Criticisms of Obama for being ""a professor"" - and the same criticisms have been brought against Warren. The implication is that a 'professor' type can't handle practical situations.

  2. Palin et al distinguishing 'real' America from the 'elitist' America of NY etc.  What she really means by elites is intellectuals, as far as I can tell, and she implies that they lack common sense, or have clouded their common sense by too much book learnin', doncha know.  ;)

  3. Less and less value is placed on education for it's own sake - people are encouraged to go to college to prepare for a job, not to learn.  And liberal arts majors are ridiculed (especially on reddit!), which is (in my opinion) essentially a ridiculing of intellectualism.

Lady 2: Will that work in Hawaii?
Lady 1: All cell phones are terrible in Hawaii... I have no idea why.

"Ok, to put this into context for America:  
I'm from the South.  Deep South. Alabama to be specific.  I've also tested multiple times in the genius level, was valedictorian in my high school, had a pretty elite, though boring, job in the Marines, and then went to Vanderbilt for a degree in BioMed engineering; I am an atheist, I am socially liberal, I like universal healthcare, I voted for Gore, Kerry, and Obama; I am, in other words, the exact antithesis to the baptist redneck flag wavin' republican that is so associated with the southeastern United States.  However, there are a lot of things that I love about the south: the food, the friendliness, the slower-paced lifestyle, the choices in recreation, the general folksiness of it all.  
  
  

So, while I'm not ashamed of the fact that I'm from the South, I do hate that the second that someone not from the south hears my accent: they automatically deduct 120 IQ points and think that all I want to do is kill some Sand Niggers and burn some crosses.  There's a stand up comedian, I believe it's Dylan Moran (Black Books, David in Sean of the Dead), who sums it up pretty good; he said that whenever you talk to a German person, no matter what they're saying, in the back of your mind you're going ""Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, ad infintum..""  
  
They're not ashamed to be from Germany, they're just fucking sick of the stereotype associated with being from Germany.

"i read an editorial in the [new york times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/opinion/05rich.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=stockholm%20syndrome&amp;st=Search) which pretty much sums up my opinion - obama has had his hands tied behind his back by the republican party and is left with no other option but to appease the republican party in order to push *anything* through. read: he was forced to pass a tax cut for the rich whilst borrowing two hundred billions dollars more this week. that plus wikileaks, obama is withering away.

what if i he didn't run in 2012? if he does, it will be half-assed. i can imagine is thinking to himself, ""fuck this shit. i've got daughters to raise!""

anyway, i don't know who the fuck i'm going to vote for in 2012. whoever gets in might get inherit the prestige of sailing us through the global economic collapse.",1

"Well, I'm a Republican but I don't hate Obama and I don't agree with everything Rush says.  However, I think I can answer your questions.

As far as the Limbaugh/O'Reilly thing, it's all about polarization.  I know a lot of Republicans who are very right-wing, and even they think that Rush is crazy.  The reason for this is because Rush is trying to embody everything Republican at once.  If a general Republican idea is that more poor people are poor because they're lazy than because of extenuating circumstances (as in &gt;50%), Rush will go all the way to 100% are poor because they're lazy simply to make a point.  Although most people who listen don't believe that, he still represents the basic idea that they do agree with.

Similarly, Ann Coulter is generally balls to the wall crazy, but she does make some interesting arguments that you just don't get from other sources.  By listening to what she says, I can filter out the 90% that is total garbage and think about the 10% that makes sense.  According to reddit this makes me a fundamentalist Christian right-wing fascist, even though I'm not a Christian and I don't like fascism.

It's basically the same thing as Keith Olbermann.  You can like Keith without having to agree with absolutely everything he says, and when he does say something stupid you can usually just hand-waive it away.  Reddit allows this for Olbermann but doesn't allow it for Rush and friends.  That's why you think that someone who listens to Rush has to agree with the all the crazy, messed up shit he says, whereas people who listen to Olbermann are smart enough to just tune the crazy out.

In general, those pundits are the only people Republicans can identify with in the mainstream media.  As much as redditors refuse to admit it, 
there are very few places in the media where a Republican point of view is given any real consideration.  When you're faced with a sea of people who generally call you retarded for positions you don't even hold, it's only natural to gravitate to people who support your ideas, even though they do it in a retarded way.


As for the Obama hate, in my opinion a lot of it has to do with his fans.  Obviously you're going to have some feelings of bitterness when your guy loses, but in general Obama has done a pretty good job.  However, when you turn on the news and every single day see stories about how Obama ate cheese in the most amazing way possible, you're going to start getting annoyed.

This is further compounded by the fact that the last president was not so good.  Bush did a lot of damage to the concept of 'the Republican', and it's very hard to shake that.  For the last 4 or so years, Republicans were the sole cause of every problem in the country.  News organizations posted daily death counts of troops, ran stories about war protests day and night, continually showed signs of public discontent with Bush, showed approval ratings on a daily basis, and in general exposed every little problem with the current system and blamed Republicans for it... AND THEY WERE MOSTLY CORRECT.  Bush caused just a boatload of issues, and his party was certainly responsible for a lot of it.

So then Obama takes office, and you wouldn't believe the transformation unless you were on the Republican side.  The media *completely and immediately* stopped talking about troop death counts on a daily basis.  War protests dried up instantaneously.  Obama's high approval ratings were shown daily... until they started to decline.  Now you almost never see them.

What's worse, the Democrats as a whole are getting essentially a media pardon.  Back under Bush the Republicans had the power, thus the Republicans got the blame.  Now, the instant Democrats get the power, Republicans are still to blame for the problems.  It's not that the Democrats couldn't get the health care bill passed; it's that Republicans stopped them (even though they didn't posses the power to).  It's not that the wars are a political mistake anymore; now they're conflicts that WE MUST stay in and fix.

For a personal example, it took everything I had to not throw something at the TV when the media was commenting on how amazingly progressive and wonderful it was that Obama was giving a townhall meeting in China.  'A townhall IN CHINA!' they said.  'What an amazing thing this is!  I can't believe we are able to witness the first townhall in China!'... EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT BUSH DID IT WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE.  I don't think Democrats know what it's like to see every single news network (aside from Fox) run something that is so blatantly false.  You guys get to watch Fox and laugh at it, whereas we have only Fox (which is stupid because Fox is a pretty stupid news organization).

Of course there are some Republicans who hate Obama simply because he's a Democrat, and some who hate him because he's black.  Many of the people I know who dislike him dislike government in general, and don't want something like health insurance, something vital to living, to be handled by something that pretty much everyone agrees is inefficient and slow and has a habit of bungling things up.

I'm not saying these opinions are correct, or that they make sense; I'm simply explaining what they are.

As I said before, I generally think that Rush is crazy, and that Obama is doing pretty well.  I'm proud of my country and my president.  However, when you take the extremes like Beck and Rush and then try to pin that on Republicans as a whole, it's no wonder that they upset and seem crazy.  When arguing against the ultra-liberal types I tend to argue for conservative things that I don't even agree with simply because it's so frustrating to hear poorly-reasoned arguments get support simply because they are directed against unpopular opinions.

I don't think Democrats really understand what it's like to be constantly lambasted on every channel for things you don't even believe.  It gets maddening, and that's where the Rushes and the Becks find an audience.  Just because I listen to them doesn't mean I agree with them on everything or even most things.",19
"Thankfully, I'm just a guy with no connections and no responsibility who doesn't believe in anything that goes on in the political world.  So, no need to worry about me losing sources.  All I have to do is make sure my tea-party cousins and my Obama voting parents see the information leaked through other groups in as simple a way as posting it on their Facebook walls.  As stupid as that sounds, it's about the most effective thing I can do.  If you talk, people don't listen, but everyone is always so happy to see a red circle at the top left corner of their Facebook.",2

"So, how do you explain him trying to try to get a site about it taken down? I want to remain neutral in this, but why is Glenn Beck trying to stop people from simply asking whether he raped and murdered a young girl in 1990?

"I think the misconception of people who like this bill, is that we won't actually be paying for it directly. But we will. 

Places like fast food chains, restaurants, grocery stores, movies theaters, etc that didn't offer health care before, now have to. In order to offset those costs, they will pass the expense on to the consumer by raising the cost of goods. Many of us are concerned that our cost of living will sky rocket, and there are still not enough jobs for those of us who are unemployed/underemployed to offset this. 

Secondly, many of us fear that the government will start taxing us for things they deem ""unhealthy"". Like the tanning bed tax. How long will it be before items with a higher caloric intake than the government thinks is acceptable come with a higher tax? We already have ""sin"" tax, which I think is hilarious, since we are heading towards a godless country. 

I don't think its just the health care reform that's eating at some people. I think its the steps the government, both Bush and Obama have taken in the last couple of years, as far as corporate bailouts and the amount of our tax dollars the government keeps throwing at the corrupt.  Because providing everyone with healthcare is not going to stop doctors and hospitals from charging you $200 to use a tongue depressor to look down your throat, in fact, they will probably start charging more.

"In 2007, February-ish I think I went to LA to see Obama give a speech.  Security was ridiculously light.

All that was needed to get in was a registration print out from home.  They didn't search my camera bag, no pat-down, no metal detectors. The one thing they were strict on was that no one could be elevated above the stage.  There were bleachers about 20 yards away and behind the stage that no one was allowed on and when I asked why they said no one could be higher up than the stage.  The press corps was on another set of bleachers next to the stage but they were all around the same level and had press passes and all that good nonsense. ",1

"My parents are Fox News addicts, so I know a little about the mentality. However, I try to nip all political and pseudo-political talk in the bud (otherwise, I get called things like a ""fascist communist"" (?) or a hipster. Never mind that my parents don't know what any of those words mean), so I don't have any real definitions. My guess would be that:

1) Real Americans are white, born and raised in the US, God-fearing, church-going, anti-abortion, anti-gay, climate change-denying, severely lacking in critical thinking skills (regardless of IQ), lacking in compassion toward those perceived as ""Other"", terrified of change, guillible, pro-Israel, in favour of the Iraq war . . . I could probably go on, but you likely get the idea. Also note that to be a Real American, you generally need to fit all these criteria. Ex. a liberal Christian (such as myself) who has no problem with gay rights or abortion would not be a Real American. Nor would be a white God-fearing Muslim who prays 5 times per day.

2) You hit the nail on the head where you say ""directly take away someone else's rights"". Tea party members are overwhelmingly afraid of change. I'm not really sure why, but it's the impression I get from talking to my parents or being forced to watch Fox. Any change away from the status quo, particularly if it is a move to the left, will be greeted with cries of ""they're taking away our rights!"" In many cases, this is related to the fact that people do not understand how taxation works. They don't want to pay more taxes to support Obamacare, because they might need that money to pay for healthcare if they get sick. They can't fathom that the tax money is actually for the same purpose, because government is ""big, evil and steals money from the little people.""

Slightly related anecdote: I attended a Christian book club with people I really didn't know. I can't remember the book title, as I had not joined the group early enough to have read it. One of the girls in attendance said that the group described in the book had turned over all their earnings to a central committee that then decided how best to use that money for the good of everyone. I pointed out that they had essentially reinvented government, and a rather Marxist one at that. No one believed me, and I spent the rest of the night being attacked for my odd views.

"This is something I have been wondering about for a long time. In the 60s and 70s, young people especially, set out to change the world in numbers - and they did. Nowadays, say in the past 20 years, there are only fringe groups of young activists in US who take a stand. It's a subject ripe for sociological studies. I believe that people are so cynical about making change, worry about being tagged a 'radical' or whatever, and really are the ME generation x 10. The politicians and big business LOVE the fact that Americans - esp. young folks - are uninvolved and generally disinterested in changing their country. This is not meant to be a blanket statement, but with one disaster after another in this country over the past decade, you'd think that young people would mobilize more than ever before. All I can say to them is: It's NOT your future because you don't own it - you've let the rich and powerful determine your future - and it's looking really bleak - no job creation, jobs going over seas, little concern over the environment, more money spent on prisons than schools, racking of the federal and trade decifits (80% Bush's fault). There is very little sense of civic duty or responsibility like there was when I was a kid. All I can say is that if you lie down on the rails and let the train run you over, you have no right to complain about it later - paraphrasing Thoreau. I hope some day people become active again - and I'm not talking about a one-off (Obama election) or the Tea Party. ",1

I strongly believe you are adamant about this, not because you are overly political, if you were, you wouldn't need to ask us.  But you are a teenager who was told to do [X] otherwise [Y] will happen, and no one will tell you what you can and can't do.

I noticed you didn't state he said to register THEN vote.  I don't think I have gone to the ballot box once where I checked every selection/issue yet.  Just because you registered to vote, does not mean you must vote.

Also, I don't know if it is connected in California, but something you DO need to do, as a male anyway, is register for ""selective services"" aka the Draft.  I hated doing it, but whatever.

Third:
I doubt you are doing this out of principal.  Sure, you are deferring to it NOW out of principal as a defense because of the many posters here.  But I am pretty sure it's a result of my ""Firstly:"".  That being said, I wouldn't want someone with your myopic vision voting anyway, either with me or against me.  Not enough critical thinking.

The teacher should have instead offered bonus credit for registering to vote, as the option embodies the dynamic of voting or not voting in my opinion.  In the idealistic sense, the teacher is really looking out for your best interests, because the best way to get the government to pay attention to you is to actually have the power to change them.  And before the assholes jump out and state ""voting doesn't matter"".  I am from Florida, and unfortunately, I assure you, it does.

""Voting doesn't matter"" is the war cry of those who want to be armchair political pundits without having to actually go out and vote.  A lot of them don't realize that voting doesn't guarantee you your way, that simple understanding escapes so many who are disenfranchised by voting 3rd party (which I am for, but it need to be organized better, there are some [I] in congress).  And enfranchising minorities, even the young, gets that minority heard.

Do you think the 2012 elections will ignore the younger demographic?  (one of the demographics that were key to Obama).

Better yet, if I were you, in all the teenage angst, what I would do is go out and register, tell the teacher you would not, take the failure if possible, then write the story down as your introduction letter to a college application.

Hell, let's spend MORE money to fix it! The Democratic solution is always to raise taxes or figure out some other magical way of explaining (or lying if necessary) how it's going to financially balance out. Proof: Right now they want to do a second stimulus of hundreds of billions of dollars that we don't have, and call it something else so it is more palatable to the taxpayers, who already overwhelming oppose the idea from all sides, which is going to magically save or create jobs when there has been little evidence of the previous stimulus doing so on any meaningful level at all. ... and at the same time they say they want to fix this.
