"I get your perspective, but IMHO it comes from an erroneous view that the purpose of life is to have a charmed life without struggle.  This is a common view, as well as the idea that life is all about doing as many ""cool things"" as possible like traveling, skydiving, writing a novel or what have you.

Struggle builds character, and making sacrifices for the other is the best possible way to show love to someone.

I believe the purpose of life is to love and be loved, and not in the cheesy romantic sense only.  This POV creates meaning.  People are sad, depressed and so on not because they don't have good things in life, but because they lack meaning and purpose.

That is why the West is so much more depressed than much of the world.

So, to me, being alive is inherently beautiful and good, no matter how terrible the circumstances.  This is no way meant to discount the gravity of anyone's suffering, my own or others'.

Edit: I agree people should use their brains regarding procreation, although I am not against having kids.  I would love it if all children were born into ideal circumstances for their being raised.  What that entails is another discussion. 

However, if all humans could easily overcome strong innate biological urges with reason, the world would be quite a 
different place!",1

Another bad example is a subway sandwich being literally translated as a subway sandwich (what?). Stuff like that. Some jokes just can't be carried through the translation. There was a halloween episode with Marge being a witch upon which Bart says ""Great, now I am also a son of witch.""

"I think the problem is the two main party's don't desire or prepare for coalitions and when they finally got into one they just ignored the 'third' party, which is why it was a mess - the conservative coalition acted as if it was the their party was the majority and that the lib-dems were part of their own party... and not that this was supposed to be a compromise - which is surely what a coalition is.

The entire point of having seats in parliament is those people who don't get a majority still have their voice heard. But a seat majority overrides that, since [generally] a party will vote as one. Which is why a coalition isn't a bad thing - it means no party holds a full majority and it means ALL the party's -big and small- votes matter. It's far more democratic.

So as 'terrible' as the coalition was - it was still more Representative of peoples votes than before. Which if you ask me is more important.

We shouldn't be chastising the voters or the system or even the coalition as a possibility itself. We should chastising the shitty party's who did nothing to work together like they were supposed to.

The seat in parliament system is DESIGNED so that coalitions happen and are a perfectly valid option - any politician who whinges about it simply isn't doing their job. ",1

"Here in Canada they don't call it a tax, but above 100K or so there is a 3% ""fee"".   But it's not a tax, it's a fee.  The part that hurts tho, is if you have RRSP (something like a 401K) Where it's not taxed until you take the money out of the fund.  The plan being you invest it when your income is high, and then pull it out when your income is lower, and you are at a lower tax rate.   

But anything in the estate that is an RRSP is taxed all at once, at the high income rate because it all comes out at once.

Still, there will be some money there, even without insurance.  ",1

Meaning that, you can't find love/a soulmate/whatever you want to call it, by looking for dates and looking for sex. Make lots of friends and develop those relationships and some day one of them will become clear to you as the person who's going to spend the rest of their life with you.

I'm not saying any of this was right - it wasn't, and there were probably some more legitimate avenues to get some of the things I needed or wanted through charity or borrowing etc etc. But when I was poor, I really didn't feel bad about stealing. Now, I make decent money, and I would feel fucking ridiculous if I stole something. There is just no reason for me to because I can afford basic stuff like renting a movie or buying an album on iTunes, so I'd feel terrible about stealing it. It's just much easier to take a moral high ground when I can get what I want/need (within reason - still middle class) than when renting a movie would overdraw my checking account. ",3

"Yes, sure story time. So my girl friend and I have a lot of sex. Basically every time my roommate leaves he has to be sure he leaves for half hour intervals. I live in Bromley where this past semester we've had 4 fire alarms that I've been present for. 3 of which were nearly back to back. In the 1st of the 3 my girl friend and I were together and I was just putting on a condom when ""ringgggggg"" so we both quickly get dressed and walk down the stairs... It's a tall building. Needless to say we were not happy. A few days pass and basically the exact same thing happens. At this point it's now a joke between us that our sex is so steamy that it sets off the fire alarm. So finally the 3rd time. We had just gotten in the shower together and had started to mess around when ""ringggggg"" and she says ""shit"" and reaches for a towel. I stopped her and said wait here. I ran into my room naked and grabbed two sets of ear plugs. I came back in and we had some of the wildest sex I've ever had. The shower was not large enough to contain it. Best of all whike the alarm was still ringing and everyone else was outside we could really let loose and be loud and crazy. 

The end :P",3

"I'm in the belief that if you truly know yourself, you'd never be alone.  Feeling alone just shows that there is a dependence on the environment to make a person happy.

Take this time to find an interest, whether if it's a happy way to pass the time, or a way to ignite your day.  Whatever it is, if it makes you happy, keep it in your pocket until the next but of loneliness.

"Oh, trust me, there's worse than this. How about this:

You know someone, but you have zero interest in them. Suddenly, they tell you they like you... in a more special way. A few weeks go by, and you realize that you've been blind and this person is really worth it. However, a few weeks after that the other person cools their feelings and you spend 1 year ""Liking someone who doesn't like you back, and thinking the situation will change when it won't."". I was perfectly fine not seeing her in ""that way"", but she just had to confuse me and make me suffer later on. Thankfully, a few months ago I got out of this fucked up situation, though I had to cut all communication with a good person.

Word of advice: Don't be someone's doormat. No matter how great they are, there are many other people like them waiting for you. Don't waste 1 year trying to make someone like you. Yes, it may work in 1 in a 1000 relationships, but in 99% of these cases it is most likely that you'll end up waiting months to get hurt and hurt again. I know people don't think like this when they experience this situation, but it's much better to suffer for a few days at the start instead of being tortured for months.",1

"Was a manager of a retail store at the local mall. It was a typical Saturday afternoon, I was folding some shirts and gossiping with my best friend who also happened to work there with me when suddenly the most attractive guy that I have ever seen in my life comes in to look at some pants that were on display in the front. I start freaking out and getting butterflies while my friend begs me to go talk to him. I walk over and awkwardly ask if he is finding his sizes okay and he says, ""Yeah, just browsing."" and makes a beeline for the exit almost immediately. I walk back to my friend defeated and tell her jokingly, ""The love of my life just walked out that door."" and go back to folding, thinking nothing of it. A few minutes later he comes back in and introduces himself, says he had to at least know my name, that he is only in town for the weekend with some friends for some event, and we exchange numbers. Long story short I ended up marrying the guy and the friend I was working with that day was in our wedding. Our love at first sight story!

"Using a throwaway because my main can be linked, and it's something  I want to keep private for the time being.

I am/was addicted to xanax for a period of 4-5 months, I have been detoxing/going through withdrawal for it for nearly 3-4 weeks now, my family doesn't know and most of my friends neither. My friends mainly don't know because I'm just generally afraid they'll see me as lesser, weak and unstable. Or if they do know that I got problems, I barely turn to them on the shittiest days (the ones where I literally want to die)

How did it begin? I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, anxiety and a mild case of depression. I am not certain I have all of this but I do experience panic attacks, depression etc, but that's not that important.

Why I'm telling this is that me getting hooked on xanax was due to it being prescribed to me. I had a few months of just going to a psychologist, my anxiety etc was pretty mild then and I dropped it by not seeing it as a huge problem or obstacle in my life. Last year it got to the point of panic attacks multiple times in a week which lead to more anxiety and depression and even some periods of suicidal thoughts.

My friends told me to go see a legit psychiatrist who well..after some time of talking to me diagnosed me with what I'm ""diagnosed"" with right now and prescribed with me with some SRI's (don't remember which ones exactly), those didn't do shit and then I guess she figured it was due to anxiety and prescribed with xanax off the bat, the strongest benzodiazepine there is. For 2-3 months or so I took it with the doses I was told, but at some point (I listen to a lot of rap and they glorify xanax abuse), I decided I should try it with alcohol. So I did, and let me tell you holy shit it felt amazing. I had not tried any other drug than weed and shrooms before that and I generally felt really relaxed and okay. That was the point where constant abuse of the drug started happening, something which eventually lead to me getting addicted to it.  Why did I start abusing it? I was in a shitty place mentally - I was insecure about everything. My looks, my personality, my disorders (I still am and hate myself) and it was a nice way to escape it, and while it doesn't have the effect of opiates etc, it worked for me.

At that point I was getting into partying a lot more. A big circle of my friends consisted of DJs and just people who party a lot (still are, but I'm trying to distance myself from them, even if it means losing a big portion of my friends). I started hanging out with them and well at some point the routine went as follows: daily xanax doses, if I had a shit day I'd drink alcohol also. On the weekends? I partied with them and got wasted and high. I probably had a period where I wasn't even sober for an entire week.

I manipulated with doses so I didn't create any sort of suspicion although I OD'd a couple of times. A few weeks ago since I saw that this is a hole I can't and won't want to climb any more deeper in, I decided to call it quits.

I went to a new psychiatrist, explained my situation and got new benzos to help me with withdrawal (hospital-based detox wasn't an option, my family can't know). Was told that since my doses weren't that high that I should be able to deal with it.

The physical part is well, I guess gone. The start was horrible - shakes, nausea, the pain was horrible and I wanted to die (no seizures luckily) but I'm seeing signs of the emotional one starting. Suicidal thoughts are resurfacing, my anxiety is coming back and I'm scared, I won't off myself, but I'm scared of falling back into something else or just generally fucking myself over. I've been lucky, I haven't lost a lot. I've lost friends, especially one who was the sweetest and most amazing person in the world for me, but she couldn't handle it anymore. My academics have obviously gone to shit, but thats the least of my worries right now. I hope I'll manage, but I just want to say - this shit is nothing to fuck with. Mental illness is treated like shit in most places, you'll probably just get prescribed a drug and left alone, and that's where things like this start.



Whether it be oxy, xanax or regular SRI's, please talk to people if you think you might start or are already abusing them. Go to your psychiatrist first of all, but talk to your friends and family, just don't let this shit happen to you. I'm pretty sure I will never escape this and my perception of myself has changed forever, I'll always see myself as an addict, something which you don't want to see yourself as, because of the stigma mainly and well, just thinking that you're that weak as a person that you can and are an addict. (even if it is not true that addicts are weak, I still see myself as weak due to this)",9

"Oh boy not me, but another guy at my work recently left in what I would call... close to what I'm reading here...

So I work at a pretty decent financial firm in Boston. Around the time that reviews and promotions are happening (my company is big on filling higher positions from within), one guy who works at my company, lets call him 'Steve', starts leaning on his supervisor (a real hard ass from what I've been told) for a promotion that he's  been gunning for, for apparently about 8 years. So this year, Steve has had it, and he isn't being subtle about wanting that promotion. Steve's supervisor looks at him, and plainly states that Steve is simply not a good enough, nor intelligent enough worker to be considered for the position.

Well, later in that day, Steve's boss is sitting in a small meeting with some board members on the 28th floor. What does Steve do? Why, he walks into the meeting, and without saying a word, he punches this guy square in the face, taking him right out of his chair. From there I think he must have realized what he had just done, and he proceeds to flee the property. 

Sad thing is, I think Steve is still in jail... You don't fuck with people with money like those guys have I guess. Still thought it was a killer way to say 'i quit'.

Update: There seems to be a little debate over this. To add more information, the boss was a jerk, and apparently really difficult to work with if he didn't like you, so good on Steve for leaving. At the same time, word got around, and apparently, Steve was, in fact, a terrible worker, and apparently he was jailed for this assault and how he handled it over the next few days (apparently things devolved into things involving drugs and him fleeing from the police). I can't really remember how drugs were involved but I remember them being a part of the story. Mostly it was just him fleeing police I guess.",27

"That movie scarred me for years. My husband picked out the movie and I sat down to watch it having no idea what it was about. At that time we were trying unsuccessfully to have a baby that I dearly wanted and I was starting to think it would never happen. That opening sequence was like my own personal worst nightmare--that we would be unable to have a baby, that we wouldn't ever pursue our dreams, and then that one of us would die and the other would be left alone (I'm crying even typing this...good grief.)

I was so not prepared and I sat there for a while trying to hold it together, but it was really hard because I had this awful wailing cry building up inside of me and it was so hard to try to hold it in. Finally I said I didn't want to watch any more and left the room.

My husband finished watching and for years afterward always talked about how good the movie was and how I should have stayed and watched it. I couldn't even hear that movie *mentioned* without being on the verge of those awful tears again. Just thinking about it or even hearing the title of the movie mentioned made me feel so sad. It was so upsetting I never could even explain to my husband why it had bothered me so much because I knew I'd end up sobbing uncontrollably that really horrible kind of crying you never want to let out.

It's only now, years later, that we've had a baby that I feel like I could ever watch that movie. Until I had the baby (I mean right up until she was safely delivered), there was no way I was ever going to watch that movie. Still haven't seen it, though.

She held out long enough for confirmation that the other three survived, that Owen was gone and then she died.

This means warm blooded animals, with the extra energy needed to regulate temperature, don't fare as well. It also means that anilmals are better off minimising the time they spend tracking prey, which explains the highly venomous snakes.

Worldwide, desert (low energy ecosystem) snakes tend to be very venomous- like rattlesnakes.

Once we passed him he sped up and stayed right behind us. We were going nearly 100 mph. My dad saw an abandoned rest stop and decided to pull over and let him pass. Then the drunk guy decided to stop too, so we took off real quick. He continued tailing us for a long time until he spun off the  road into the medium. We thought that was the end of it but he got back on the road and caught up with us. Finally we got to the winding canyon before the Hoover damn. It was a two way with a fair amount of traffic but my dad managed to pass quite a few people to get some distance between us. Getting to the damn wee saw a cop and pulled over to tell him the whole story, but the entire time we were stopped we didn't see the drunk driver's car come out of the winding canyons. We figured he must have crashed.

Your Sim can also go around the party and talk/joke to everyone. Try to stick to interactions that you know will succeed, because if an interaction fails, the score will fall.

"Ex boyfriend of mine. He was the singer and guitarist of a band. Very talented guitar player, and he could carry a tune, though he was not virtuoso by any means. He was gigging at a local bar, and I was there too, of course. In between sets, we were joking about not having girls in bands. All very lighthearted, no harm done. 

Later in the night, the manager asked me to go up and sing something, so I did. Now, I've been singing my whole life, so I'm pretty good. Also, perhaps more importantly, I'm young, blonde and fairly good-looking, and the crowd is probably 80% male and they're all wasted at this point. So I appeal to the audience. I go up and sing ""House of the Rising Sun,"" and by the time I'm done, everybody's cheering loudly. My boyfriend leans in right before I go sit down and says, ""See? This is why we can't have girls in the band,"" completely serious.

Let us consider the 2D case first. Meaning you want to prove, that you don't live on a line. Since I can look left and right and don't see the earth going up into the sky, I can assume that I'm either at a local maximum (positive curvature) or the earth is flat (zero curvature). However, let I have limited sight, let's say of range R. At all points I have been, the curvature in a radius R around my position was either positive or zero (i.e. I've never been on the ""inside""). Further it makes sense to assume some continuity along the surface. However, I'm not really sure how to proceed from this...

"Met a beautiful girl, she didn't like me, but we just kept  magically bumping into each other. One day, I went to go surf, took a cab out to the surf spot, surf spot was no good walked back and bumped into her, walking out of town. Fate. She decided to give it a try. A couple months later i spent a week with her in Vancouver, was totally smitten. Would have become a Canadian citizen, and she ended up marrying the guy she was dating  locally. Apparently, I'm a starter-wife",1
"It shouldn't matter if a guy is buying something for himself, because it's up to him what he does in private. And if someone is judging a guy because of it they shouldn't be working there. 

Basically in my opinion there isn't a taboo for a guy to go buy toys for himself (although I was nervous as hell when I went and bought my first toys). You'll find most adult shops like that, unless they are weirdly ultra-conservative and work there. It's unlikely but then again I'm a Christian that owns that type of shop, so I guess it could happen.",1

"Ok so I was actually broken into once (actually twice..) and I only knew at the time because of an accidental booby trap. My husband and I worked at sonic and one of their metal menu sign parts were knocked out and we found it and were allowed to keep it but we just put it on the ground to be put somewhere at another time. Well we put it in front of our front door and our room door is right by that door. Anyways, we fell asleep and I woke up to a ""clang"" and I got really scared because I remembered the sign was there. I woke my husband up and he put it off as the dog outside hitting the mailbox (which was bullshit because it was clearly a noise from the inside). I kept pestering him and suddenly I hear our massive amounts (like 20+) of door-hung suspenders clickclack against our door which was literally the most alarming sound to ever hear. I was frozen and the door kept inching open and clicking and finally I woke my husband up again (I was frozen for a long while, the door was halfway open by then). It turns out it was the outside dog (stray we were trying to find the home to) inside the house and my husband bolts out of bed and grabs the only thing we had.. A metal BB gun, sadly.. And he finds the back door WIDE open and I remember having locked it when I went to the bathroom that night. We got a proper gun after that. 


**TL;DR- a bent out of hell metal sign, suspenders hanging on the door, wandering dog**",1

"Clickbait headlines are actually falling out of fashion. Google and Facebook are improving their algorithms to de-value articles with clickbait headlines. Thankfully most decent news organizations also have self imposed policies of refraining from using clickbait headlines. After all, you can still write a good, informative headline that entices the reader to click but isn't clickbait-y.",2

"Its easy to just label politicians as greedy, but not 100% accurate.  Politicians are human, just like the rest of us.  They may get into politics for the right reasons, but once they're in, the goal is to do their job well.  Unfortunately, the majority of a politician's job is to raise money for their next election.  So they do what the rest of us do at our jobs to get by; they find the path of least resistance and simply follow it.  Its easier to find one or two big donors, do their bidding, and have fully funded campaigns for life than it is to do actual good work, then sell that experience to your constituents every 4 years, especially when your opponent has essentially infinite funds because they took the easy path.",14
