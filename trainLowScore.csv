"Oh yeah that explains it. You know in the jailbreak community at one point 95% of paid tweak downloads were pirated? 95%+ of people won't pay for the most indie, doing it for the love of it type thing you could possibly imagine. Not all media is made by giants, but all of it is pirated at pretty much similar rates. 

And yeah, the media industry is a total dick. But pirates started it. Media's first move was ""don't copy that floppy"" and ""you wouldn't download a car"" and when that didn't work they went on to suing people and scare tactics, as well as pushing for really fucking bad legislation. Which they'd have virtually no interest in pushing if it weren't for 95% of people using their shit not paying for it. You have to understand it's an extreme reaction to an extreme situation.

And yeah, you pirating to ""not give them money"" is not going to help. If magically piracy stopped tomorrow, they'd be elated to not have to pay billions of dollars to try to protect their copyrights. You pirating to stick it to them is what is making them do what you don't want them to do.

""I don't know any, so it can't be true!!"" You probably don't know any men who get women to sleep with them just the same, yet you think one half of the puzzle makes the whole picture. You have this idea that men who chase women bow to peer pressure, but its much more likely that a guy who is afraid to put himself out there is the one who succumbs to peer pressure than one who is bold enough to risk rejection on a constant basis. You also have no ability to separate yourself from the argument and have made the arrogant mistake of inferring that I am talking about you personally, when the reality is that I am not. Not everybody finds the same things attractive, but there is a pattern, and that pattern does not support the idea that women prefer interesting men over those who can protect/provide for them and their offspring.

"Because the types of foods that come with a ketogenic diet are foods very high in fat, and saturated fat.  
Fat is fine, within the AMDRs. Saturated fat (yes I know, certain saturated fats, specifically medium chain ones aren't as bad for you) can be troublesome.  
A diet high in saturated fat can increase your risk of stroke/heart attack. My gripe with it, is you're removing carbs (fruits, grains), and then expect to get your fiber from where, solely vegetables? I guess if it's planned properly, with legumes, beans, and nuts, those are good sources, but all I hear is eggs, bacon, red meat, pastries, etc. which (barring eggs), generally aren't healthy for you.  
Another issue is the sustainability. We eat food for pleasure, as well as health. By severely reducing your intake of carbs, that limits the foods you can eat, on a ketogenic diet.  
The reason why most dietitians wouldn't recommend it (here in Canada), is because it doesn't follow Canada's Food Guide. That said, if you insist upon following it, dietitians should be able to help you with designing one that could potentially be healthy. There's nothing wrong with carbs, and in fact, to reap some of the best benefits of fibre, you need to eat foods high in carbs (whole grain wheat bread, oats, fruits &amp; some vegetables like carrots).  
So while yes, fats *and* protein have a higher satiety factor (fill you up quicker, compared to carbs, with the same amt. of energy), it's a very hard diet to follow, and if you ever introduce carbs into your diet again, you'll likely see a trend back towards your previous weight (or at the very least, a spike in your weight immediately, due to increased glycogen stores, and water with them).  
Plus ketones smell, they make your breath smell, and I'd imagine you might have constipation issues eating all that fat and protein with little fiber. Essentially, just eat healthy foods, no single macronutrient is *bad* for you. we went through a low fat phase, now it's low carb, I wouldn't be surprised if protein is next.",-3

In summary that CO2 and earths orbit are basically the only factors of any significance to effect the climate. When in fact there is only one major factor, which everyone seems to ignore; the sun.

It is clear the suns solar activity is the main cause of climate change and always will and has been and such articles are clearly disproved by papers such as this one:

http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/795/1/46/pdf

An article with a summary:

http://www.sciencealert.com/a-mini-ice-age-is-coming-in-the-next-15-years

There seems to be a wealth of scientific information that clearly demonstrates that CO2 is not a major factor (and in fact probably more beneficial (plant growth) than negative) and rises in CO2 are caused/followed by temperature rises (Ice core records) and CO2 simply acts a dampener allowing heat to reside for longer. A simple summary:

http://www.climaterealists.org.nz/node/601

It seems to me the science is very weak at best and its more of a political stance/agenda than anything science based as the scientists in this article mention:

Doesn't that promote excellence? It makes people strive to become elite. That's how the real world works, where the best get most of the money; universities are made to prepare you for it. The best students academically get scholarships, the best artists/musicians get scholarships, the best researchers get funding, the best athletes get scholarships.

&gt;It isn't doing much to promote it to 'newbies' for the purpose of basic fitness and team skills.

At most universities, you have access to the sports facilities when you're a student, and you can sign up for recreational sports or fitness classes. Isn't that enough resources to get someone started? Elite athletes all started without funding at one time, so why can't a ""newb"" do the same? It doesn't make sense - you want to give money to people who didn't work for it.",-2

"I want a man (a very specific man) to know what it was like when I risked my job to be in his hotel room. I want him to know what it was like to decide that I was going to give myself to him in the sweetest, most intimate way. When I was tangled up in his arms anticipating what he was going to do next...

&amp; I want him to know what it felt like when he tossed me aside like a sack of potatoes &amp; said ""nevermind, I can't do this."", &amp; proceeded to watch TV like nothing happened. (to be fair, we have a lot of history &amp; have been planning this hotel rendezvous for months) I thought he was joking. When I realized he was serious I thought I was in a nightmare. I pinched myself I found out that yes this is reality &amp; no he wasn't joking. He just rejected me, totally naked, legs spread apart, with his dick pressed against my pussy. I asked why &amp; he shrugged.

I began to cry. I've never felt so used &amp; disgusting. I trusted him, &amp; he threw that in the trash. I just wanted to leave &amp; go home but by then I had too much to drink, &amp; could not drive. I shut myself in the hotel bathroom &amp; cried. I could not believe he did that to me. I came out of the bathroom &amp; he said that I was nothing but a mistake. He said he wished he would not have taken me to his room. He said I was dumb for trusting him in the first place.

It felt like my heart was just put in a blender. This wonderful passionate vulnerability that I gave to this man was betrayed. I was sobbing uncontrollably. Instead of trying to console me, he told my if I didn't shut up he was going to drop me off at the walmart parking lot. So now, I was not only heart broken, I was terrified. I had no choice but to lay next to this pathetic excuse for a man until morning. 

I want him to know how deeply this has affected me for the last few months, since it happened. I want him to cry himself to sleep like I have. I want him to lay on the floor at work &amp; cry like I have. I want him to feel worthless &amp; gross just like he made me feel. I want him to wonder every day why he wasn't good enough. &amp; most importantly I want him to feel what I felt so that he never treats another woman like that again. There was no reason for my tears that night. We spent the day together &amp; it was wonderful, &amp; I couldn't have been happier up to that terrible moment. That moment replays in my mind every fucking day &amp; I just wish it would stop. I can't live with it anymore. ",-4

"So there is actually no real link to claim it's physically addictive. I understand you sourced a neuropharmacologist, but quoting someone else even though they're a professional in the field is considered the lowest strength of evidence when looking at the evidence based pyramid used in all research. There are many many ways to misinterpret data and even cause human error in data collecting. I think it can be addictive in the same sense that some are addicted to video games, or any sport/recreational activity. If you love playing football and it makes you feel good then you would be pretty upset or even depressed if you tore your ACL and had to sit out the rest of the season. It all depends on the mindset of the person and their reason for using the substance. If someone who loves football uses it as a way to get away from their family or stressors in life and they play so often as to neglect their family then one may claim that is a negative addiction even though people don't typically consider playing sports to be negative. It all depends on the mindset and reason for use. As far as physical addiction of weed, there is absolutely none. People don't break out in sweats or tremors. There isn't anyone who is in a correct state of mind that would choose weed over living. Data from mice can only be extrapolated to the human level but it can not be considered equal",-4

Darlin', you don't have to feel sorry for me, my life is fucking amazing. I've done and accomplished more before the age of thirty than most people have by the age of 60. My life is completely in my control, and part of the reason it's bullshit-free and easy-going is I don't get seriously involved with slutty girls. If other guys did that, they'd have a pretty care-free life too (and would get a hell of a lot more done). 

Right now I'm writing this from a gorgeous tropical island in the Gulf of Thailand. Next week I'm going to Japan before heading over to Siem Reap, Cambodia. I have a gorgeous girlfriend who has only been with two men in her entire life and goes out of her way to make my life comfortable by cooking for me, massaging my shoulders when I get injured at boxing, and spending quality time with me on mutual interests. She has a wonderful personality and she's someone I enjoy being around on multiple fronts. She also meets my requirements - the ones you seem to think are my ONLY ones. 

So, you shouldn't feel sorry for me, you should feel sorry for all those girls out there who are going to get used up by all the guys they're fucking and get stuck as a last option in their late twenties, while those who didn't turn to fucking every swinging dick that comes (because ""you go girl - you do you!"") get wifed by successful men, caring, stable men.

Tbf to them, this was during a time that, for reasons I won't bother getting into, a lot of partying takes place for a couple of weeks. Russetid, if any Norwegians should happen to read this.

"Does this not prove the point that guns are a problem then? 

If DC has the lowest gun ownership, and highest gun crime, does it not stand to reason that guns are a danger to society, no matter what laws are in place?

Furthermore, part of the issue here are the illegal guns being used sold and traded, without being part of a registry. It would make sense that high gun ownership may have lower gun deaths (relatively), if that state is properly enforcing laws, or has laws other states do not. I would bet, that if you compared all the data you supplied, you'd find a correlation for the premise that less guns = less deaths, or strict gun laws = less gun violence, etc.

"Economist here. We consider ourselves forensic scientists of a sort, considering we investigate things that fuck over the whole world at a time.    

Had a project once that involved modeling (cost-benefit) the economic ramifications of a man-made river in Spain. This river was supposed to bring water from the central areas down to very arid and touristy locations south of Valencia. 

Here's the fun part. We estimated the costs to be XX,XXX,XXX,XXX Euros (withheld, not sure if still secret...) with annual operating costs between 8%-8.5% of the total as well. Lets just say that the Spanish government came back and told us ""there is no way we can get the EU to fund this fucking shit with numbers like that, fix it or we will deport you and your fucking family"" (my family came with me for a year stint). This wasn't the only threat made. 

Cutting this story short, the numbers were booked, pretty badly too and if I recall we did that on purpose in the hopes that Spain would get caught red-handed and bitch-slapped by the EU. They didn't really... :(
Spain received hundreds of millions of Euros to build this river, neglecting most of the cost estimates because the EU wouldn't fund a river with such high operating costs, and the actual net benefit from the river would be less than 1/3 of what Spain reported. 

The river wasn't ever built. Coastal Spain built desalinization plants instead, equally disastrous. One of the many reasons Spain is a terrible place. ",-13

"There's a fundamental problem with this.  Everything boils down to being able to pass as the opposite sex.  What if you can't?  What if people knew you before the change?  Is a person supposed to move far away to avoid detection?  If a someone finds out that you are not the sex you are attempting to appear as, the operation is for naught, it all comes crashing down.  God forbid a transsexual has a coworker find out about it and tell people. How would that work for someone like Bruce Jenner?  If I were to see him on the street and call him Bruce, what would happen?  Is everyone in the world supposed to play along with the delusion?  Is that the end game, to force everyone who knows the truth to conform?  That isn't healthy.

I don't believe the only treatment is transition.  I don't believe a sex change should be recommended at all for the reasons above.  Any time a person has a problem with their brain chemistry, they are prescribed medication to correct it.  It does not make sense to tell a person to get a sex change that may or may not fool people.  No one tells a a delusional who thinks they are Napoleon to dress and act like Napoleon, no matter if his brain chemistry is identical to the real deal or not.  If reality drives a person to suicidal actions, then they should be hospitalized until they can deal with reality.

EDIT:  And another massive problem with this: if a trans person is supposed to pass as the opposite sex, what about a sexual partner?  What incentive would there be for a passing trans person to tell someone they are with who doesn't know, the truth?  Is it okay to do that to people?",-5

"&gt; they're literally just there to make sure no one has a panic attack, why is that a bad thing?

Because inevitably, the use of triggers becomes mutated to range in meaning from ""this will make me have a panic attack"" to ""this topic is bad, I don't like it, therefore don't discuss it"". To be precise, the latter leads to censorship and avoidance of ""troublesome"" topics. The vagueness of a word like ""troublesome"", left entirely to the demands of an individual, is what leads to the criticism of the use of trigger warnings. 

There is also research that suggests that exposure to triggers rather than avoidance is better in the long run for overcoming the response. [Here](http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/hazards-ahead-problem-trigger-warnings-according-research-81946) is an article with more info. 

Of course this doesn't mean that trigger warnings should be abolished, but they should retain a grave use rather than simply preemptively tagging everything with a TW/CW. Also, this does emphasize a certain role on the individual to seek out materials that they might find discomforting and/or panic-inducing and avoid them if they so wish. A parent can check out questionable details of a film on iMDb before showing it to their child, for example. It is not on the movie to describe every single sexual, violent, graphic, etc. encounter or dialogue that occurs in the movie.",-5

Yoda trained Luke well enough in a few weeks/ months in order to fight Darth Vader and manage to get a few hits in and not die.

So Yoda managed to train someone to survive against one of the strongest beings in the universe in a few weeks.

Yoda never resented Anakin after Obi-Wan took him as his learner. Anaking often got in trouble for his risky war tactics, but was also commended at the same time because they got the job done.

On top of all this, Palpatine was manipulating the force to confuse the Jedi, as well as all the political shit.

And lastly, Yoda went to Degobah to train in order to keep his consciousness alive from the living force to the cosmic force.",-1

It is not that the government **protect** the monopoly, it is the government **allows** the monopoly. The key difference is anyone CAN open up a competing brand, it is that market forces prevent it from happening.

In order to compete, you would have to figure out how to get fast, reliable, cheap internet to every house in a gigantic area. This is so crazy expensive, and so crazy risky (because people already have the product you are trying to sell them, you can't be sure they will be willing to switch). Mix that with the fact that margins are so low, that two companies will not survive without increasing prices DRASTICALLY. That is why the government relaxes the anti-trust laws when it comes to companies like that.

Important note: Again, I have not studied Comcast. I described the *type* of government permitted monopoly that I *think* Comcast is. so please correct any mistakes. ",-8

If a candidate running for office said he has an invisible friend who doesnt believe in gay marriage... we would cast him out of the campaign. What makes religion different? 

I honestly think being crazy is a right but I feel like allowing crazy to control things is wrong. The problem is where society draws the line for crazy. I just feel we are unfairly excluding religious people from that category and its having a major effect on the community.

"Actually there are many many accents, some sounding very similar to each other. If you think that 90% of the population speaks nonregional standard American English, that's because of the media. Similar to Americans thinking everyone in England speaks RP. The media usually only portrays Southern/Texas, NY/NJ and occasionally Boston. Portrayal of other accents is always butchered or exaggerated (Hairspray and Fargo). 

The one thing you can say about Britain is that it has more diversity over a smaller area... which still doesn't equate to more.

"My question is: Why is being transgender/transsexual not qualify someone as crazy? Sex is a biological classification and depends on biological markers (presence of male or female organs, chromosomes, etc.). So one's sex is a fact, a reality. How is someone denying reality not classified as crazy? Let's say if someone firmly believed they were a bird, or a cat, we would totally think they are crazy. Or for example if someone let's say doesn't have kids, but firmly believe he has 2 kids and speaks of them as if they existed (or hear voices, or sees people, or any equivalent scenario), it would be the same judgment made: They believes something that is against reality and therefore they are crazy.

"&gt;Weed made me want to do nothing.
&gt; It made me

It's a substance. It doesn't do anything. You are responsible for what you do. Phrasing it passively like that doesn't change anything. It didn't ""make"" you do anything. You did everything on your own accord. It just changed your perception of things. It made being bored fun. The weed didn't do anything, YOU DID. 

Do you only do things you want to do now? Do you wake up for work/class when you don't want to? Weed can manipulate your desires, but it hardly controls your actions. 

Like I've said all along, if you can't handle smoking weed and being productive, that's good on you for not smoking. But that's a reflection of your personality and not of the drug. You smoked for 2 years. I know people that have smoked for 30 years, make six figures a year in a technical profession, and love their life more than anything. 

It's you. Not the weed.

Is there any reason you couldn't have changed your habits while still smoking? There is not. Because I've seen this happen many times. It's just not the route you chose.

If you drive drunk and kill somebody, does Anheuser-Busch or the bar that served you get charged in the case? No. You do. Because it's your actions. 

Now, it is possible that you actually couldn't do anything because you were smoking. But that's not because weed is a magic destroyer of all abilities, but because you were incapable of willing yourself to do something you didn't want to do. Blaming it on the weed stigmatizes it, when there's plenty of successful stoners in the world. 

I classify it kinda like video games. A great way to waste time, some redeeming qualities, but not the healthiest way to spend all of your time. The difference between weed and video games, though, is it's difficult to multi-task through video games, but you can do anything while you're high.

It's working for you. And that's great. But you're perpetuating a negative stigma because you're unwilling to concede that the problem was you, yourself and not the big, bad evil destroyer of productivity and dreams marijuana.",-5

"See this is the craziest shit, but it's true.

I didn't grow up in the best neighborhood or with the best people around me but I'm upper middle class now.

I remember hanging out in front my best friend's restaurant when I was little. We would always have two kids, Priestly and Pablo that would come by and bully us. They stole my best friends Yu Gi Oh deck and almost got away with it. Well one day they came in all friendly-like and tried talking to us like we were friendly (we weren't). Anyways, they asked us to join them as they made their way into the 7-11 next door. We had nothing better to do, it was a lazy afternoon so why the hell not? We went with them, I noticed they were wearing hoodies and it was pretty damn hot out.

Didn't take long to put 2+2 together and we weren't even in the store yet. I remember going in and just knowing they were going to steal from the store. My friend also had a hoodie on and they all quickly bustled into the candy aisle and starting stuffing candy into their pockets like nobody's business. Anyways the store clerk realizes this right away and starts making his way over to confirm. I am freaking out, my friend doesn't want a part of this but they stuff his pockets full of candy anyways. He's trying to stop them but the candy is falling all over the ground. The clerk starts yelling and we all bail. I didn't steal anything but I wasn't going down for this shit. That was probably my first exposure ever to stealing. Honestly, it scared the hell out of me but a small part of me felt exhilarated, too. We ran probably a few blocks down the road but the clerk never left the store. Eventually we all stopped, sat down, and ate the candy. 

I mean, that was my first exposure to stealing in my life. Afterwards, I felt a combination of thrill and guilt. But you bet your ass I ate that fucking candy. 

When I first torrented, it wasn't like that at all. It was just...over. No running, no fear for your life. Hell you could literally TELL people that you did it on the street and people wouldn't stare at you weird, pull out their cellphones and call 911.

It's also *really* difficult to find one that doesn't have a lot of baggage (at least the kind that bothers me) and is also willing to accept my baggage.  I mean, I'd have to swim in the really shallow end of the gene pool and/or accept a really messed up relationship where she gets to treat me like dirt. I'd honestly rather just pay for it.",-3

You say that stock investing is risky but you are allocating a significant portion of your portfolio on the basis of a macro prediction that is not necessarily guaranteed to be true and further, you won't necessarily benefit even if you are right.",-1
