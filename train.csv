All that aside, I hate this show more than any other show on television and it's almost so deep I can't even fully explain how much I cannot fucking stand that drivel. The characters aren't people, their not even stereotypes of nerds. That would require them to exhibit any sort of anything resembling human behavior and they sure as fucking fuck can't muster that. Jim Parsons is what bitter assholes accuse NPH of being, as in only tolerated because he's gay. He's not funny, he's not talented in comedy whatsoever, he's not even charming, and the worst offense? After watching A Normal Heart, I think Jim Parsons is a damn fine actor, which means his character is a *choice*. Holy shit dude really? You looked at that script and said, ""this is the direction I'll take this character!"" Jim Parsons has very early onset Alzheimer's, it's the only explanation. I'm not going to bother with the rest because it's just a descent into hackery from there. Every plot can be mapped completely out from the opening episode. Penny will end up with glasses, and the nerdy chick will end up with what's his fuck. The rest will pine and end up in relationships in spite of the fact that they're all dim witted sociopaths who display the emotional depth of a fucking grapefruit. They sure as fuck won't grow, develop, or, again, display human characteristics as one has come to expect in a show that, at it's logical core, is about humans.

"Some service members qualify for disability payments if they were injured during the term of their service. You have to serve 20 years and be honorably discharged to get a pension.

Some service members could qualify for welfare, but welfare was reformed significantly in the 1990s, and now a 60 month limit exists.

Even if they DO qualify for some sort of financial assistance, many veterans have mental health problems which lead them to make poor financial choices (not budgeting properly for rent, food, etc./spending their limited funds on alcohol/illegal drugs).",1

Just this weekend we went to Costco to get our 10 yr old daughter her first set of glasses. A set of high quality lens &amp; frames, discounted by our basic medical plan, cost a grand total of $25.

"You haven't tried the right drink, you don't have to drink straight liqueur.  There are hundreds of different beers and thousands of mixed drinks. I just started learning the ropes of mixed drinks and beer. A bit of advice would be to loose the ""All alcoholic beverages taste like piss"" attitude. A bias I admittedly had till recently. There is a drink I had that was a mixture of a spiced rum and coke. Tasted just like Soda, I could drink it all day. Ill admit that beer is not a taste for everyone. I personally only drink it at parties because I am not the biggest fan of the bitterness. But if taste is that big of a concern for you, mixed drinks are the way to go I think. Search up some recipes, some of them look fucking amazing. 

Edit: One I plan on trying is called a ""White Russian"", A coffee tasting vodka type drink with cream. Also a variant called a ""Dirty Russian"" that uses chocolate milk instead of cream. ",1

"Tales from the Borderlands is a pure Singleplayer game.

The usual Borderlands Franchise (Borderlands, Borderlands 2, BL Pre-Sequel) are the Multiplayer games that are most fun with friends.

Tales from the Borerlands is an interactive story game by TellTale Games (The guys that also did [The Walking Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEHuHKvNvLk)). 
It consists out of many dialogue, choices, cutscenes, quick time events and small puzzles.

So if you want to play a fun Multiplayer Shooter, go for the main Borderlands Franchise (with Borderlands 2 being the best one in my opinion; you can play all of those alone without big difficulties as well).

But if you are okay with a Story based game that takes place in the Borderlands universe, then go for Tales from the Borderlands.


Personally, I'd recommend to just play all of them. They're all great games. (Haven't played Borderlands 1 yet though)

On modern planes (say, A320) the PACKS (air conditioning) are automatically switched off during the engine startup, on other older designs (say B737 or MD80) you have to manually switch them off, there is even a gauge that measures the pressure of the bleed air, it has to be above a certain value (and it will not be if the packs are running).   
Ultra modern planes like the B787 don't have pneumatic systems at all and they use electric power to start the engines.
Almost every aircraft has the capability to use external power, external bleed air (rarely used) and external air conditioning.",29

"I'd honestly like to see job descriptions which included the job duties, the work environment, and a brutally realistic example of a normal day. Not just because such things might scare people off, but there are certain types of jobs which don't appeal to most people, but *really* appeal to a small subset of people, who would probably do really well at it and be prepared to happily do that job for years.

(My own example: I love work environments which are 100% desk work, freezing cold, and where I'm not likely to interact with another human being for the whole time I'm there. No job ad, however, would ever describe a job this way, because it would scare off the majority of the applicants - those applicants who would have been unhappy doing that job anyway and would have left as soon as they could, resulting in high turnover and training costs.)

Solution: put out a secondary job ad, even an anonymized one through a recruiter, with the nastiest aspects of the job front and center. Anyone who *does* apply for the job through that ad should probably be given priority, as they're far more likely to be psychologically suited for it.",1

I got a mail from gmail saying someone is trying to gain access. I changed it but I saved the intruder's IP. I didn't know whose IP address it was but I was sure of one thing. Only four people knew about that email address and three of them wouldn't do anything like that. Still I asked them(him included) their IP addresses. He changed his IP minutely and that made me realize that he could be the only one trying to access it. Then I falsely said to him that my brother knew some people who were into cyber crime and that they would easily track the person who is trying all this and he fell into it.

Sorry if you think the MSM are all stooges or whatever, but there are enough amazing, independent journalists at the NY Times, NPR, the Washington Post, et cetera et cetera, they wouldn't just go along with it. First they'd quit, then they'd be *very* vocal about it.

Vocal enough that you'd have to be pretty dense not to notice them. They'd be screaming out what happened in every outlet Hypothetical Rich Candidate *didn't* buy. If he turned around and bought those outlets, they'd get money from Hypothetical Rich Candidate's enemies and they'd start a new one. People would find out, and a lot of people would be *very* upset.

The portion or so of America who *are* that dense -- you know, the stereotypical soda-slurping reality-TV fans the rest of the world likes to think make up 100% of America -- sure, they would vote for Hypothetical Rich Candidate. But there'd be enough outrage among people who pay attention that Hypothetical Rich Candidate's loathsome actions would be common knowledge among the rest of us.

Does that mean Hypothetical Rich Candidate wouldn't get elected? Nope. There are a lot of soda-slurpers out there. We're basically in this situation already with Trump. Loathsomeness on that scale might work, but even if it did, it would be easily noticed.

"A thirteen-year-old should still have plenty of time to make mistakes and learn from them - Ra knows that I did - but before *too* much time has passed, there are a few fundamental areas of personal development on which it would be good to focus. I've shared these points in the past, but hopefully someone will find them useful now.

------

1. **Learn how - not what - to think.** Examine arguments, data, and evidence, and learn to make rational decisions. Don't get emotionally invested in a given conclusion before you've had time to consider whether or not it's the right one. When you need to think fast or quickly choose a course of action, pick the option that's most likely to have the greatest benefit for everyone involved.

2. **Basic etiquette.** Everyone has different ideas about how they'd like to be treated, but there are certain social rules that most people follow. Practice good table manners, wear appropriate clothing, answer questions with direct answers, speak in proper English (not slang), and be polite to everyone around you. Cut the profanity and vulgarity from your vocabulary, while you're at it. There are better ways to say things, and it will make those rare occasions when you *do* swear, curse, or cuss that much more potent.

3. **Cooking**. A homemade meal will almost always be less expensive and more nutritious than anything you can get on the go, and if you're shrewd about the way that you make things, a few simple ingredients can stretch for a lot longer than you might think. Invest in a good selection of spices, but don't go overboard. When you have the extra time and money, experiment with more complex dishes that you can use to impress friends, family, and romantic partners.

4. **Cleaning.** Get into the habit of looking at cleaning like *upkeep* rather than a project that you undertake before you're having company. Make sure everything has a specific place where it belongs, that your various surfaces are always clear, and that you don't accumulate a lot of unnecessary junk.

5. **Managing your money.** Your first job is going to make you feel like you're rich beyond your wildest dreams, even if you're only earning minimum wage. Resist the urge to spend it all at once, because good financial habits will make your life a *lot* easier when you have to start paying for rent and food. Keep track of how much you have and what your expenses are, and learn to keep a buffer between those values. If that means putting off an unnecessary purchase for a little while, so be it.

6. **Repairs and maintenance for your house and car.** Things break. It happens. Knowing how to fix these problems (and how to prevent them in the first place) will not only save you a lot of time, hassle, and money, it will also help ensure that you aren't caught off-guard in an emergency. Obtain a decent set of tools, and keep them in an easily accessible location.

7. **Hold on to your health!** Your body is going to start decaying in another decade or so. You won't be able to eat an entire pizza in one sitting without thoroughly regretting it later, and ice cream will leave you so flatulent that you'll have to learn entirely new ways of concealing farts. Start eating right and exercising *now*, and you'll be able to have a lot more fun on those occasions when you decide to go wild.

8. **No, you are not in love (but that's okay).** Your brain is positively saturated with hormones, to the point where you can ""fall in love"" at the drop of a hat. Worse still, you can stay invested with enough fervor to make you think that it's something really meaningful and lasting. That ability to get swept off your feet will never go away... but it *will* be tempered by deeper and more adamant emotions. You may think, right now, that you're in love with whoever that special someone is... but when you look back in as little as ten years, you're going to smile with amusement at how mistaken you were. Don't plan your life around that person. You're going to break up in the first semester of college, if not sooner.

9. **The Internet is forever.** Everything - ***everything*** - that you write, post, or do online can come back to bite you. There are ***no exceptions***. Something as simple as a misspelling in a Facebook post can (and will) have effects that you never would have expected. Always present yourself on the Internet as though you were onstage for the entire world. Put your best foot forward.

10. **The Internet is** ***still*** **forever.** Okay, so, you messed up. Maybe you sent a naked picture to the wrong person. Maybe you wrote something really stupid online. Whatever you did, it doesn't matter: It's out there now, and it's not going away. Learn how to own up to that, show how you've grown as a person, and *do not* make the same mistake again.

11. **How to find and keep a fulfilling career.** This is something at which you'll be working for most of your adult life. The best way to get a head start at it, though, is to look at your hobbies and interests and find a way of contributing to their respective fields. If you enjoy video games, learn to make 3D graphics or write code. If you like music, teach yourself how to use audio editing programs and recording equipment. Not every skill will serve you in a given career, but every skill *will* contribute to your overall repertoire, making it that much more likely that you'll find success in something you enjoy. When the time comes to apply for that first *really exciting* job, find a way to differentiate yourself that's both unique and compelling, but not irritating or obnoxious. Above all, never stop learning.

------

Now, obviously, there will be folks who disagree with some of these points. That's completely understandable, and experiences will certainly vary. For the most part, though, people who can swear up a storm at work or who are still together with their high school sweethearts are the *exceptions*, and it's much wiser to assume that you'll be saddled with the standard lot in life.

After all, the world doesn't *owe* you anything, and the best opportunities will always be the ones you learn to make for yourself.

"Used to be a freight handler and a temp worker tipped a concrete lined cabinet over on me.  Saw it coming at the last second and managed not to let it hit me in the head or chest.  The top edge of landed on my right thigh.  The weight of the cabinet pinned me, and a few of the guys in the warehouse tried to lift it off me.  They managed to lift it a few inches and when I tried to pull my leg out they dropped it.  I was pinned for about 15 minutes until the rescue squad got to me.

They got me to the hospital.  I screamed obscenities and passed out when moved me onto the table for x-rays.  When the x-rays came back they freaked out and rushed me into surgery.  The damage was a comminuted fracture of my femur, a dislocated knee, and a large section of muscle in my thigh had been severed ( I think they called it an internal laceration?).  Spent 9 days in the hospital after surgery, couldn't walk for weeks.  Then I moved to crutches for months.  Was told I would walk with limp and need a cane for the rest of my life.  Was 24 at the time said ""fuck that"" and knuckled up on physical therapy.  Roughly an hour and a half every other day, and then working on my own when ever I could.  I don't need to use a cane and my limp is not very noticeable.

Wound up with a steel rod that is anchored in my hip and runs the length of my femur and is anchored in my knee.  I still have a pronounced indention in my thigh where the muscle was separated.  After years of overcompensating I am beginning to have problems with my ""good"" leg.  Bone spurs, plantar fasciitis, and my ACL is going to go at any time.

"In a sense!  Many of the same structures involved in speech (i.e. the lips, tongue, palate, larynx) are also involved in swallowing.  Since speech-language pathologists already have extensive knowledge of these structures, at some point speech pathologists started to delve into the realm of swallowing and its disorders.  Of course, the parts of the brain that are active for speech/language vs swallowing are different, but nevertheless, the two systems have a lot in common. If someone comes to me with a speech disturbance (i.e., slurred speech after a brain injury), I will automatically do a swallow screen.  If the person is having trouble moving their lips, tongue, etc in a precise manner to create speech sounds, it is likely that they are also having trouble coordinating the intricate set of movements that comprise the swallow.",2

&gt; Ignore the Kid

&gt;The reason this works is fascinating: ""During a tantrum, your child is literally out of his mind. His emotions take over -- overriding the frontal cortex of the brain, the area that makes decisions and judgments,"" says Jay Hoecker, MD, a Rochester, Minnesota, pediatrician. ""That's why reasoning doesn't help -- the reasoning part of his brain isn't working."" Says Alan Kazdin, PhD, author of The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child, ""Once you're in a situation where someone's drowning, you can't teach them to swim -- and it's the same with tantrums. There's nothing to do in the moment that will make things better. In fact, almost anything you try will make it worse. Once he chills out, then you can talk.""

And #2 is

&gt;Give Your Child Some Space

&gt;""Sometimes a kid just needs to get his anger out. So let him!"" says Linda Pearson, a nurse practitioner and author of The Discipline Miracle. (Just make sure there's nothing in tantrum's way that could hurt him.) ""I'm a big believer in this approach because it helps children learn how to vent in a nondestructive way. They're able to get their feelings out, pull themselves together, and regain self-control -- without engaging in a yelling match or battle of wills with you."" This trick can work on its own or in tandem with the whole ignoring bit.
