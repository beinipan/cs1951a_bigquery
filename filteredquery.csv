95% said they were pro first term abortion if the mother had a baby born of rape or a baby with known genetic defects.

"But that's the problem, of cause and effect. Is racism what keeps black people in the lower socio-economic class, or does black people being in the lower socio-economic class drive racism? Aside from bringing up examples of other racial groups that tend to do very well here (arguing against a ""white supremacy"" feeling, though not discounting a ""racism against blacks specifically"" problem) let's look at a common racist belief.

Belief: Black people are all criminals

Effects of belief: People will be more afraid of black people on the street, treat them as hostile, police will be more likely to pull them over/stop them (causing increased statistics of black crime).

Statistics behind belief: Black people are arrested at a much higher rate than other races (this perpetuates the belief). Part of that is certainly caused by profiling based on the belief itself, part is likely caused by the correlation between socio-economic status and crime rates. 

The problem is, it's a self re-enforcing stereotype. Which came first is not relevant. Black people are poorer overall, poor people commit more crime, black people are perceived (correctly) to commit more crime, police start to profile (consciously or not) which drives up crime statistics (catching more people doing the same crime than other races). Perception of high crime restricts black people from improving socio-economic status, and the cycle repeats itself.

So, what's the fix? There are a lot of potential fixes, depending on where you want to cut out the cycle. One viable fix (being discussed here) is improving socio-economic outlook. That will naturally drive down crime, which will drive down perception, police profiling, etc. Another is trying to combat the perception itself first, but that seems like it would be a lot more difficult to do.

These are two separate issues, but considering how over 80% of Libertarians voted republican in the last two elections, and they saw no irony between their votes and their 'anti-big-government' stance, it really is not surprising to read a *boy scout libertarian* who is misusing catch-phrases. 

Anyway, regardless of the mixing of messages, let's use one example to refute the premise.

*Every* time? Bernie Sanders voted against the Iraq War which was a massive expansion of government. So no, not *every* time, and the same example refutes the claim of him being against 'greater peace'.

Let's not mince words, the phrase 'small government' means privatization of public services. One of the primary Bush/Cheney tactics of winning libertarians to their side was to further privatize the armed forces, which is by far the biggest branch of 'big government', however the military is not profitable for private corporations unless there is war and/or the subsequent rebuilding of foreign countries. 

Did you listen to all those republicans at the last debate promising to spend more money on big government (through expanded military spending) and then whine and complain about how Obama had reduced it to such a pathetically small size? That's who libertarians are going to vote for?

On over all raw viewer numbers it would have beat CBS's normal programming on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. I promise you that if the DWS had told CBS that they had to air the debate on a weekday or they didn't get a debate, CBS would give them any day of the week they wanted. 

Lets go forward to the week of December 14-20th on ABC. The democratic debates was ABC's over all topped viewed show that week. Again, Even assuming the same viewership numbers they could have gotten any day of that week.

I do not have access to last weeks numbers for NBC but considering they normally have the worst viewer numbers of these three networks and the last debate was viewed by 2 million more people then the people then the previous two, its pretty safe bet to assume it was NBC's best viewed program of the week. So again the network would have given the DNC any day that DWS wanted.

Truthfully, there is a reason why networks air their crappier shows on Fridays, Saturdays, and sometimes Sundays(NFL Season). Its because those days are the days that the least amount of people watch their channels. So the numbers would almost certainly be higher if it was on a weekday.",2

&gt;First of all, I said I don't really want to discuss this as it isn't relevant (I proposed a different plan),

More belief. I believe more people would spend more money with more disposable income. OMG IM AN ECONOMIST TOO!!

Yes. With more disposable income people would spend it more. **Some**on charity. 

Could you imagine a system that works like this? That starving family just HOPES enough people give to the RIGHT charity to feed them. Hahaha what a terrible, terrible idea. 

&gt;Charity is crowded out by taxes, and nearly all economists agree with this.

Nearly all. Haha Schiff you mean?

&gt;For a socialized school to be greedy and take more money than necessary? I feel like this shouldn't need an explanation, as it is obvious.

So a capitalist school would never take more than needed? Is that what you're saying?

If the school was socialized, it wouldn't be charging now would it?

"What is really weird; this all started over a poacher, who beats his kids and starts wild fires to cover up his poaching.

AND they didn't want to get involved with Bundy. Lol.

What Occurred -

&gt; The circumstances of both fires are worth examining. **The first occurred in 2001.** (the Father &amp; Son) According to prosecutors, several members of the Hammond family set this fire “less than three hours after Steven Hammond illegally shot several deer on BLM land,” a claim they corroborate by citing testimony from D.H., Dwight’s grandson and Steven’s nephew. The fire, moreover, “consumed 139 acres of public land and destroyed all evidence of the game violations.”

&gt; Additionally, the government claims that three men were camped nearby when the Hammonds’ started these fires, and that Steven and Dwight knew about these campers when they decided to start the fires anyway.

&gt; **Steven lit the second fire in 2006** (the Son) — he says that he did so as a preemptive burn in order to prevent an unrelated wild fire from spreading to the Hammond Ranch. At the time, however, the federal Bureau of Land Management had **imposed a “burn ban”** to protect firefighters who were busying trying to stop the wild fire. **A second fire, such as the one set by Steven, could have potentially spread and endangered the firefighters.**

The Verdict -

&gt; **So Dwight (the Father) was convicted of setting an illegal fire that burned federal land and Steven (the son) was convicted of setting two such fires.** One of these fires was allegedly set to cover up evidence of a different crime; it could have endangered the lives of several nearby campers; and it did indeed endanger one of the younger members of the Hammond clan. The other fire was set despite a federal order intended to protect the lives of firefighters.

Why the return to prison??? -

&gt; **They were found guilty by a jury of illegally burning federal government property.** They chose not to appeal that conviction. **The law requires a minimum 5 year sentence for that crime.** They convinced the federal trial judge that it was unconstitutional to impose that minimum in this case. **The government appealed (which it would virtually always do when a minimum sentence is found unconstitutional). The court of appeals said the minimum sentence was constitutional and ordered it imposed.**

Using this a quick reference to the 'PRO' Bundy group; getting a lot of 'pro gun' rights IM's atm.

Notation - The land in question (the land that Bundy's group has annexed), used to belong to a Native American community.

Notation 2 - The BLM was discounting access/prices to that land at 93 % percent; literally pennies on the dollar.

Notation 3 - Anyone or everyone, please use this information to destroy the false narrative about the Hammonds or Bundy being 'victims' of the system.

edit 1 - On a side note. Several smaller articles have the Hammond's starting fires in 1999 as well.

"This is just the statement on their website, which explains all the candidates' positions on SS. Hillary has a page there as well, along with all the republican candidiates that have policies about it...AARP is still trying to remain neutral though 

Hillary's position per the website:

&gt; “For 80 years, Social Security has been America at its best. Social Security reflects our shared belief that every American should be able to retire with dignity after decades of hard work. That no American should face poverty because he or she is disabled, or when a loved one dies. That we all have an obligation to each other.

&gt; Social Security isn’t just a program—it’s a promise. As president, Hillary will:

&gt; Defend Social Security against Republican attacks. Republicans are using scare tactics about the future and effectiveness of Social Security to push through policies that would jeopardize it. The real threat is Republican attempts to undermine the bedrock of the system. Hillary believes that Social Security must remain what it has always been: a rock-solid benefit that seniors can always count on—not subject to the budget whims of Congress or to the fluctuations of the stock market. She fought Republican efforts to undermine Social Security when she was a senator and throughout her career, and she will fight them as president. As president, she would:

&gt; Fight any attempts to gamble seniors’ retirement security on the stock market through privatization.
Oppose reducing annual cost-of-living adjustments.
Oppose Republican efforts to raise the retirement age—an unfair idea that will particularly hurt the seniors who have worked the hardest throughout their lives.
Oppose closing the long-term shortfall on the backs of the middle class, whether through benefit cuts or tax increases.
Expand Social Security for those who need it most and who are treated unfairly by the current system—including women who are widows and those who took significant time out of the paid workforce to take care of their children, aging parents, or ailing family members. Social Security works well, but it should work better. Hillary will fight to expand Social Security for those who need it most and who are treated unfairly today. For instance:

&gt; The poverty rate for widowed women 65 or older is nearly 90 percent higher than for other seniors—in part because when a spouse dies, families can face a steep benefit cut. For a two-earner couple, those benefit cuts can be as much as 50 percent. Hillary believes that we have to change that by reducing how much Social Security benefits drop when a spouse dies, so that the loss of a spouse doesn’t mean financial hardship or falling into poverty.
&gt; Millions of women—and men—take time out of the paid workforce to raise a child, take care of an aging parent or look after an ailing family member. Caregiving is hard work that benefits our entire economy. However, when Americans take time off to take care of a relative, that can reduce their Social Security benefits at retirement, since those benefits are calculated based on their top thirty-five years of earnings. No one should face meager Social Security checks because they took on the vital role of caregiver for part of their career. Americans should receive credit toward their Social Security benefits when they are out of the paid workforce because they are acting as caregivers.
&gt; Preserve Social Security for decades to come by asking the wealthiest to contribute more. Social Security must continue to guarantee dignity in retirement for future generations.

""The House plans to vote for the Senate-passed de-funding legislation on January 6 after Congress returns from its Christmas break.

The vote would come days before Obama’s expected State of the Union address and Obama has 10 days to sign or veto the bill, which he’s already threatened to do.

In comments about the omnibus bill and the reconciliation bill, Speaker Ryan made it clear that the omnibus, contrary to multiple news reports, does have limited on Planned Parnethood funding and other pro-life riders that stop abortion funding.

“First of all, we did put the riders on Planned Parenthood to prevent them from having any money going toward abortion – like we have in the past – and we maintained all of our Hyde Amendment protections for pro-life,” Ryan said.

Ryan said the House had no chance of getting a bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood to Obama’s desk if it put the de-funding language in the omninus as opposed to the reconciliation bill.""",1

It swept the entire discussion aside by evoking the right to privacy to say there couldn't be a discussion in the first place.

"First of all, that's a quote from an article written two days after the midterm election in 2010.  So I'm not sure how you can say some of these events were passed too late in 2010 for their effects to be felt for the midterm.  They were clearly knowable enough to be incorporated into an article about Obama's accomplishments.

And yes, you can quibble over whether Obamacare is ""universal healthcare"" or whether Republicans would have passed the stimulus or bailed out the automakers (judging by the Congressional votes on those, I think you're wrong, but whatever).  But now we've moved from your original statement -- Obama did ""absolutely nothing for two years"" into the territory of ""well, he could have done more.""

Quite frankly, your last paragraph above -- ""Oh, he had majorities in Congress; he could have just fast-tracked stuff!"" displays an astounding level of ignorance about how Congress works, and what the make-up of Congress looked like in 2009 and 2010.  The ARRA passed the House a month into his presidency.  How is that not fast enough for you?  Or maybe you mean fast-track financial reform?  Obama proposed what became Dodd-Frank in 2009.  He worked a year to get it through Congress intact (and the final bill largely tracked his initial proposals) and it wound up barely passing the Senate; a 20-vote swing in the House would have killed it.  

That's reality.  And that's why I'm skeptical of Bernie, who has outstanding proposals and ideas that are going to die a painful death in Congress because people like you are going to vote for the President, maybe vote for whichever Democrat is on your ballot for the House and the Senate in 2016, and then pout and stamp your feet when -- SURPRISE! -- a 240 year-old system designed to represent a diverse country doesn't instantly drop everything and blow up a giant sector of our economy just because somebody has an idea on how to do things differently.

"I can speak for Detroit - it's not a wealth or no-wealth, business or no-business issue. 

Detroit has nothing left, and has been corrupt and on the decline for a couple of decades. The city is in a great deal of debt, and they don't bring anything in with taxes. Many residential areas in and around the city, the older ones where low/middle class people would live, are asbestos-ridden and require a great deal of money to remove and replace. 

Industry died out some time ago. Jobs are largely gone. As a result, anyone who's standard of living relied on employment moved somewhere else. There's very little left in the way of a skilled labor pool. What is left is lots and lots of under-educated people. 

And ultimately, education is the problem. The city has terrible schools, filled with children who either don't have parents, or don't have parents who care, undervalued, paying off a ton of debt, stretching teachers to striking point - there's no hope for the kids stuck in these. 

Detroit needs money, lots of money, for decades to come, to fix the problem. And that's assuming the corruption is gone. Otherwise, the big picture looks an awful lot like we are waiting for the suburban population to simply die out altogether. ",11

"A perfect economy is an impossible ideal. Thinking that we'll have a utopian financial system by letting it completely fail and have people live in squalor for decades is so far beyond daft that no words even exist to describe just how poorly thought out this idea of your is. Again, we tried that with Black Tuesday. It gave us the Great Depression and World War II.

If there's one thing the last 2500 years of recorded history has shown it's that economic ebbs and flows are an inevitability and we'll never be rid of them. Thinking we can invent regulations to forever cure us of failures is just not remotely realistic. The best thing we can as a species do is collectively build in safeguards to buoy the failures when they inevitably happen and prevent them from spiraling. That's what government is for. It's our society's ultimate insurance policy against those economic death spirals.

 What you're asking for is to throw that insurance policy out and take away 80 years of financial development and knowledge and plant us back in 1929. Do you also want us to go back to not having MRIs for medicine, driving Model T's, and using uranium to make children's toys glow?

"I guess it comes down to the content of the issues. 

Gun control is one topic, civil rights is another. 

I would argue it's much more obvious that people deserve to be treated with dignity as equals. And bigotry against gays is both abhorrent and until recently was politically convenient to ignore. I'm not sure gun control is as clear cut. 

What guns are the problem guns? What ammo is the problem? What options to people have for mental health care? What types of shootings hurt the most people? What is the root cause of gun violence? How is gun violence connected with the the need for drug dealers to enforce contracts? Etc... 

I'm not saying there isn't a right answer on guns, just that it's a nuanced issue, and I honestly don't know all the angles. But it's pretty clear that gay people are people and should be treated like people. ",2

"Enabled to some degree, I suppose, but probably not as much as you think, as the benefit a single farmer would get by being able to plant and harvest a crop on his own is extremely appealing even without the additional benefits RR and BT crops bring to the table, which is why this type of farming became popular decades before Monsanto even entered the seed business, and is utilized with GMO and non-GMO agriculture alike.  The real driving force behind monoculture in modern farming is mechanization.   Additionally, [it’s questionable if the potential problems of monoculture are of greater severity than the problems associated with other forms of farming. ]( http://weedcontrolfreaks.com/2013/08/monoculture/)

As for CCD, I probably can’t offer you too much there, it’s not as if they have taken surveys of scientific consensus as they have with something like Climate Change, but I do find it interesting that when we get farming experts, bee experts, environmental experts over on /r/askscience, they tend to lean towards the varroa mite being the leading cause of CCD, though many often couple the mite with the stress transport puts on colonies.  But beyond that, what I find more damming for the pesticide narrative is the lack of good and trustworthy studies.   The study that is most often passed around, by Chensheng Lu, often referred to as the “Harvard” study to give it added pedigree,  [used dosages of Neonics at far higher levels than one would find out in the field, 100 times higher, and for a duration several weeks longer than the bees would be exposed to in the real world]( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/post_8761_b_6323626.html).  Despite this, Lu claimed his doses were within real world levels, so that is what got reported in the media.  The guy basically drowned his bees in pesticides.  Lu also conducted a pesticide (I can't remember the exact pesticide but I don't think it was Neonics, it might be in the article above) bee study a few years earlier where, after several weeks of the bees not dying under normal dosage, he randomly increased the dose to make it appear as if there was a sudden unexpected die off.  Not trustworthy.  Additionally, we can look at locations that use Neonics, but do not have the Varroa mite, and examine if they suffered from CCD like we did in North America.  Australia is one such location, and they have a booming bee population.  But let's be real here, Neonics are pesticides.  Bees are not immune to them, they are just far more tolerable to bees than many other pesticides, but if they are exposed to enough of them there will be some affect or death, but what these studies have failed to address is if the amount found on crops is enough to cause CCD, and that doesn't seem terribly likely based on what information we have.

No... it isn't. Not in the way that is being portrayed in the article anyways. There is NO CHANCE hillary will be charged with a crime in relation to the email server. They are investigating the security of the server and that is it. It is called a security referral and happens when the government believes classified information exists outside of classified channels. The purpose of the investigation is to find unsecured classified information and secure it. Not really that interesting even, just a republican talking point that some people have fallen for.

Syria was not destabilized by the US. In fact, Obama purposefully held up destabilizing Syria the way we had destabilized Libya because he wanted to negotiate a deal with Iran (Iran and Assad are huge buddies, see the Iranian troops currently fighting in Syria for him). The Pentagon's Train and Equip program trained only 5 soldiers and the CIA's program was only moderately more effective. 

We need to keep our ally, Iraq, stable. It is not beneficial to us if the Iraqi oilfields fall to ISIS.

This does not mean that the ideal is equal distribution (as in communist regimes would be the ideal). Indeed, the capitalistic system that most people have adopted as the best tool of creating and sustaining wealth does allow for unequal distribution of wealth.

"I don't know whether the causal connection is to seeing people abusing welfare, precisely, but it's been known for a long time that the poorest regions are the most right-wing, but the poorest people are the least right-wing, all else equal.  That means that in a poor state the dividing line between ""comfortable people who vote mostly GOP"" and ""poor people who vote mostly Dem"" might be somewhat lower, but it is still the wealthy in that state who are most likely to vote GOP, and the poorest who are most likely to vote Dem.

In other words, this weird ecological-fallacy Red State Guy is emerging: he's slightly poorer than Blue State Guy, rants and raves about taxes, and takes everything he can get.  But in fact it's the other way around - both blues states and red states have poor and rich families, the poorer families are slightly more numerous and slightly needier in the red states, but their middle class neighbors are more likely to vote GOP, as well.

I think what we're seeing here is potentially the best-executed political long con in American history.  If you're Trump, and you want to be president, how do you do it?

1.  Despite being a vocal democrat in years past, you have no chance getting the Democratic nomination, especially with the heir apparent Hillary Clinton waiting in the wings for the last 8 years.  The republican party, however, is in utter disarray and is rife with single-issue, sound-bite voters who perceive themselves as disenfranchised from the system.  Prime pickings.

2.  For the primaries, you run as a Republican, and you blatantly say whatever the crowd du jour wants to hear.  It doesn't matter that your message is wildly inconsistent, because the media is horrible and is really only interested in spectacle, which you can provide in spades.  By the time something you said gets some traction, you've already moved on to some other sensational statement and so has your audience.  You're two steps ahead of the media and they have no idea how or why.  You've manipulated the media all your life.  This is child's play.

3.  Primary time.  The GOP establishment has no idea what to do with you now.  You've steamrolled over their anemic, status-quo candidates because you've spent the last year telling each fringe group of the fractured republican party exactly and only what they wanted to hear.  This is the final result of four decades of the Southern Strategy come home to roost, and you know it.  You've played it like  fiddle.

4.  You have the nomination.  Now what?  Well, now it's time to win the national election, and national elections aren't won or lost on the ends of the spectrum.  They're won and lost in the middle.  Your rabid right-wing supporters aren't going anywhere because, well, they're not going to get hip to the bait and switch quick enough.  Now it's time to pivot to the center on issues that won't alert the right.  You start taking about infrastructure spending (even republican states can't argue with better roads and blue-collar jobs), legalized marijuana (the youth left loves it and, framed as a libertarian issue, so does the far right), and a number of other things.  

Trump may indeed get elected, but I suspect the Trump presidency is nowhere near what is campaign has been thus far.  This guy is a centrist saying a bunch of very fringe things at the moment as a means to an end.  He's playing the media, the democrats, and the GOP against themselves masterfully.",11

&gt; Nobody goes to jail. This is the mantra of the financial-crisis era, one that saw virtually every major bank and financial company on Wall Street embroiled in obscene criminal scandals that impoverished millions and collectively destroyed hundreds of billions, in fact, trillions of dollars of the world's wealth — and nobody went to jail. Nobody, that is, except Bernie Madoff, a flamboyant and pathological celebrity con artist, whose victims happened to be other rich and famous people.

&gt; The rest of them, all of them, got off. Not a single executive who ran the companies that cooked up and cashed in on the phony financial boom — an industrywide scam that involved the mass sale of mismarked, fraudulent mortgage-backed securities — has ever been convicted. Their names by now are familiar to even the most casual Middle American news consumer: companies like AIG, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Most of these firms were directly involved in elaborate fraud and theft. Lehman Brothers hid billions in loans from its investors. Bank of America lied about billions in bonuses. Goldman Sachs failed to tell clients how it put together the born-to-lose toxic mortgage deals it was selling. What's more, many of these companies had corporate chieftains whose actions cost investors billions — from AIG derivatives chief Joe Cassano, who assured investors they would not lose even ""one dollar"" just months before his unit imploded, to the $263 million in compensation that former Lehman chief Dick ""The Gorilla"" Fuld conveniently failed to disclose. Yet not one of them has faced time behind bars.

In general, when a government stays put and does not infringe on the personal and financial lives of its people, one can almost bet that things will remain pretty stable.
However, sooner or later a Government becomes a Frankensteinian operation that must feed its Gargantuan creature called Bureaucracy.
**And the only way to feed that giant monster is with money, which then becomes the State’s obsession since it can never have enough.**
Soon the State’s relationship with the citizenry it was meant to serve becomes exactly like that of a two-bit Mafia don with its coerced victims: “I want my cut. Capisce?”
Eventually the State’s obsession with money trickles down to every stratum of society. As Newton’s third law of motion proved, for every action there is systematically an equal reaction accompanied by opposite reactions no one expected.

&gt;""It's not crazy, it's not socialism,"" he said.

&gt;During his reelection bid in 2012, Obama made the same assertion.

&gt;""I believe that in a society as wealthy as ours, we should have a commitment to our seniors and to the disabled. That's not a sign of weakness. That's not socialism,"" he said.

"&gt;Exactly

Exactly what?  I didn't say anything about her deleting her personal emails.

&gt;As if there is congressional oversight over cabinet level officials emails

Pretending like I said congress is ""overseeing her email"" is disingenuous at best.  Congress has oversight of the executive branch.  The official communications are supposed to be preserved as part of the agency records.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html?_r=2

&gt;Her expansive use of the private account was alarming to current and former National Archives and Records Administration officials and government watchdogs, who called it a serious breach.

&gt;“It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario — short of nuclear winter — where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business,” said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath who is a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.

&gt;Under federal law, however, letters and emails written and received by federal officials, such as the secretary of state, are considered government records and are supposed to be retained so that congressional committees, historians and members of the news media can find them. There are exceptions to the law for certain classified and sensitive materials.

&gt;**Regulations from the National Archives and Records Administration at the time required that any emails sent or received from personal accounts be preserved as part of the agency’s records.**

You might want to learn about the very basics of how the US government works.

&gt;Didn't the same law apply to him?


Yes?

&gt;And if there is oversight, how was Colin Powell able to delete all his emails?


The requirements are obviously not enforced properly.   You know, with Hillary avoiding them for years as well.  It's funny that you seem to be assuming I'm a republican or something, because you keep trying to make an issue out of Powell.

Republicans love what Trump is saying, not so much for everyone else so when these stories come out his popularity increases amongst people that were already going to vote Republican. 

This narrative that is being built will be put forward to independents and undecideds later this year and they will not be persuaded to vote for Trump.

People thought Goldwater was electable and would have national appeal because he appealed to the grass-roots and the Republican establishment hated him, particularly Eisenhower. He didn't persuade anyone and got trounced. The same will happen to Trump.",8

* Do we know everything about Bernie Sanders? He has great ideas most of us liberals would like to see become law. He also has a near flawless voting track-record. Does this mean he's the most innocent candidate? Of course not, it just means we don't have any proof that he is otherwise.

There's a term that gets thrown around quite frequently nowadays - '*the right side of history*'. I think it can be translated to politics as well - Bernie, for example, is standing on the right side of politics. A sugarcoated Commie at heart, he can run his campaign in peace, and when he presents his ideas, people  are free to say '*Wow! Now that is PROGRESSIVE!*' He's positively edgy. 
Trump, on the other hand, is a right-winger loudmouth. And since the right wing is on the bad side of politics as we speak, Trump is classified as a racist, a populist, and a bigot. Combine his politics with his public persona, and you get '*Literally Hitler.*' Trump is a professional jimmie-rustler - the go-to '*racistic*' old white man
that people can ironically sneer at and say '*Ugh... I'm SO much more of a better person than this guy!*"" He has unorthodox ideas, wrong for some people, good for others, but he's on the wrong side of politics - he's negatively edgy.

One entered America's collective mind as the nice old gentleman who'll send your kid to college for free, and the other did as the smug millionaire with the shitty hair, the guy who'll deport every Mexican and Muslim straight into the ovens.   
  
I think that whether or not Trump is racist is irrelevant, because he doesn't bring 'racism' to the table when he speaks about his agenda. He's no Commander Rockwell, even if people would love him to be. For one, he's often misquoted - he's not trying to genocide every Mexican person that sets their foot on U.S. mainland soil. He doesn't think that every last illegal immigrant that comes from Mexico is a rapist - but a certain percentage of them are, and because of that, all of them will have to 'suffer'. When Trump tells this to the average American citizen, he's basically saying, '*Your life is worth more to me than that of a foreigners'.*' And the average American citizen hasn't heard anything like 
that from a Republican candidate lately.  
  
When you wrote that Trump appeals to racists, you were stereotyping - which is quite alright. Without stereotyping, pushing a political goal isn't possible. If you can't differentiate between your team and someone else's team, why should the prospective members of your team trust you?   
  
And that's where a part of Trump's appeal lies - he's the first GOP candidate in a long time who's willing to draw a line and say '*This is us, and that is them.*' Or at least promise to do so, 
once he gets elected.

"Conservative here. Sorry, this is going to sound a little ramble-ey, I'm wicked sick. You point to imperfections in markets, and your points are completely fair. But, in each case, you're pointing at monopolistically competitive markets (or even oligopoly, if you were to look at things such as airlines or cell providers). I believe that the role of government in the economy is to push markets to as close as perfect competition as they can get, and play policeman when firms try to bend the rules. Large companies can't manipulate governments or resources if there are two dozen other companies that will call them out on it and take their share of the market if they were to break the law. In my opinion, the 2008 crisis draws a lot of similarities with the housing and lending climate of the 1920's. In a perfect market, predatory loaning would be bad business because other firms would offer better deals to the customers. Of course, this assumes informed consumers, something which isn't easy to ensure. Trust busting is a great tool that needs to be utilized more often. Rule number one of economics is that many people working towards their own self interest produces the result that is beneficial to most. With something like private prisons, only 6% of state prisoners and 16% of federal prisoners are in a privately owned prisons. They don't decide which prisoners they get, but far more often than not get low level prisoners, prisoners the government decides aren't worth the same amount of money to protect. That's why mostly drug offenders end up in private prisons. I think we're starting to see that public prisons are more efficient than private prisons from some studies, and I think that's because ""prison"" isn't really a market. I wouldn't exactly say I would trust companies more than the government, I just recognize that they're working in their own self interest, and the more companies that are working in their own self interest in the same market, the more likely we are to get the socially optimal result. The government, on the other hand, has no real equals, and it's incredibly easy for them to increase the power they have. ",0

One side especialy is heavily fighting over the minority, in particular the black vote by feeding fear and anger and branding political opposition as racist.
The topic is extensive so I will try to boil it down. The media campaigns and narratives about blacks being shot by police e.g. The last prominent cases do not hold up to scrutiny when branding the police as racist. Roughly 55% of those shot in total by police are white. Haven't heard a news story on this yet. Have you? Roughly 70 police officers are shot per year in the U.S. Cannot recall the last news story. The police are accused of being white supremacists, but more whites are shot proportionaly than asians. Does that make them asian supremacists? If not why the selective logic?
The issue is one of the corporate industrisl prison/ law system and gun control as well as poverty. Is it perhaps branded the way it is to divert attention? Is it to gather votes? Is it perhaps a backdoor to increase gun control? Perhaps all three?


The topic is a boondoggle. It distracts from economical questions of wealth distribution.
There are affirmative action laws in place which favor blacks. 
When college/ unis are so expensive of course only the wealthy can send their children.
All of it has everything to do with money.
To find racism as the problem only reveals the above mentioned agenda in the absence of any evidence to support the claim.
Racial tension in america may well be at an all time high. Blacks are being systematicaly told america is full of racism. I am not in the least bit surprised to see blacks riot after yet another news story about a shooting pops up.

* Obama's decision to come out in favor of the legalization of gay marriage played a role in the Supreme Court's decision that made legalization of gay marriage the law of the land. Let me explain; when a federal statute, in this case, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), is challenged, it is the Solicitor General's job to defend it. However, Obama's administration REFUSED to defend DOMA, which resulted in a weak attempt by House Republicans to assemble a defense, ultimately contributing to the downfall of the law.

He's accomplished so much, and yes, he could have always done more, but I think in a lot of aspects he tried, but was perhaps stymied by political realities.

"Idk, I don't see how your argument is fact based. People that actually study economics as a profession disagree, and part of the reason cost of living has gone up is because the our standard of living in the us is incredibly luxurious. I think a lot of these problems you're stating could be significantly alleviated by merely increasing the minimum wage. Factory jobs didn't used to be glamorized at all, they were just the go to for unskilled workers the way that the food industry is today, and if fast food workers were comparably compensated we wouldn't need factory jobs. 

Also, there's the fact that a contentious person isn't solely interested in the well being of the US. The trade deal stands to raise the working conditions of factory workers in other countries, like preventing child labor, increasing life expectancy, and makes war less likely. Lately I've seen a strange contradiction in the liberal mindset. The contention is that ""it's selfish for the top 1% to accumulate all the wealth in the country and keep it from distributing to the lower classes,"" a sentiment I agree with, but it's odd that those same people simultaneously argue that ""we need to worry about the problems in our own country and let other countries fend for themselves"". To me, these two ideas don't really reconcile. The top 1% is to the rest of the country as the US is to the rest of the developing world.

What you're saying is reductive. Like you just heard Bernie sanders and Elizabeth warren say it, and it sounds good so you buy it. I say this as a left leaning voter who thinks that sanders is a pretty good candidate. My one big concern is that I don't think he has a grasp on foreign policy, and I think his talent for reducing all arguments to nice, digestible, ideological platitudes is exciting liberals who have share the ideology but don't know what they're talking about, and don't care to actually develop a nuanced view on the incredible complexities of most political issues. 

Honestly, to me it seems like the left has dumbed itself down to compete with the fact that the dumber the right's presentation of ideas gets the more passionate its base is. You can say that free trade destroyed out economy and decimated our middle class, but an actually informed view on this from any side would recognize that there are both good and bad effects from free trade in general, and that there are people more qualified than you and I studying this, and the majority of those people disagree with you. At the very least, I'm almost certain that what you said is closer to a talking point than an informed opinion. I am very open to your response, but I would be more swayed by actual information as opposed to sweeping ideological statements.

If you yell 'fire' when there is no fire or no reason to think there is a fire, and someone dies, you can be held responsible for the death. In the same way, if you use your firearms and it causes harm you can suffer the legal consequences. Laws already exist to punish people who use firearms illegally. What you are actually arguing is that laws should be put in place to preempt the breaking of the law by use of a firearm. The problem, though, is that this action directly conflicts with individual rights and liberties as the west has inherited from the enlightenment and as the US Constitution guarantees. The analogy would be if like if keyboards were made illegal so people couldn't type out a death threat online. This is calling innocent people guilty of potential future crimes.

* $15 federal minimum wage - this can't be anything but pandering.  Makes sense in big cities, is complete nonsense in rural parts of the country.
* Claims that large corporations pay only 4% in average net income tax (requires deceptive butchering of math - divide global income by US taxes for this figure)
* Wants to implement impossible taxes (such as stock trading taxes that would destroy ETF's and balanced mutual funds) that betray he either doesn't understand markets or is purposefully assuming his audience doesn't either.

Even his Medicare system, which is feasible (other countries have done it) - he always avoids discussing how he would actually implement it given a Republican congress.  It's an unattainable goal.

"There are usually problems when you combine Presidentialism with extreme multi-party democracy. You *may* end up with a crooked system sometimes dubbed ""Coalition Presidentialism"". It has one deep flaw: corruption.

In a two-party system, there's only one way to make the other party come together with the president's party, which is compromise. Opposition members taking ""bribes"" is something fairly rare (the way the 13th Amendment passed the house, as portrayed by *Lincoln* is an example). Now, imagine you've got an extremely diverse party system. Actually, this exists and is called Brazil. I'm Brazilian so I can show this example to you.

27 parties are represented in the Brazilian House of Representatives. Partly because they're elected through a proportional system, accountability is something that never exists (frankly, I get angry when I see Americans preferring this kind of mess than the district system. Even gerrymandered districts are better than this). There are two ""main"" parties, PT (centre-left - used to be left-wing when founded) and PSDB (centre/centre-right - used to be centre-left when founded). There's a Big Tent party that has the largest representation in Congress (PMDB, which never got to the presidency through direct elections) and a few clearly ideological parties. Sometimes they're non-aligned (such as the socialists from PSOL), sometimes they're aligned to other parties (such as the communists/socialists from PCdoB, which work as a radical wing of PT, or the conservatives from DEM). However, there are many other parties. Parties with non-existent platforms. How can a government be formed when you have tens of small parties? You have to distribute jobs. As Ministers (same as secretary in the US). As Directors of state-owned companies. That leads to terrible people on powerful positions (see the current Petrobras scandal). Sometimes, they give out money as bribes (PT was convicted for such thing, in a scandal named *Mensalão*).

A Presidential democracy can't properly work with more than four or five parties. You start having extreme distortions if it happens. Yes, more parties would be healthy for America. But not an extreme multi-party system. It creates incentives for inherently corrupt parties.",4

Unlike privileged white males, we don't have the luxury to throw a hissy fit.  If Hillary is the Jeb of the Democrats, well that's plenty good for me.

But it goes further than that IMO.  My primary concerns are cultural and racial issues. I think people and color and cultural liberals in the Democratic Party need to make an alliance with those who are in agreement with them. In particular, that means showing backward thinking working class whites (who badly need their white privilege to survive) the door and joining forces with educated whites, big business, and Wall Street.  
Bernie Sanders and his supporters puts economic populism first. They would find more common ground with Trump supporting white racists than with upper class cultural liberals and people of color.

"This makes no sense. You honestly think Hillary wants to funnel government money into the pockets of corporations?? Who, Republican or Democrat, would support such nonsense? Where are you getting this info from? You are mischaracterizing Hillary's stance completely. First of all Hillary is not proposing ""the government"" pay these costs. ""The government"" would pay those costs in a single payer system, which is not what she is advocating at this point in time.

There is no disagreement from anyone that we spend far too much on healthcare in the US. There are different strategies to address that. Single payer is one but it is not the only one. Hillary is not advocating for status quo and she is not advocating for increasing health spending - she is focused on driving costs down through cost controls (such as having the government set prices for drugs and not letting drug companies charge whatever they want, increase the availability of generic drugs and close loopholes allowing drug companies to extend their patents, etc) and limiting out of pocket costs for consumers. Bernie is focused on single payer, believing that the savings in administrative costs and bargaining power of having everyone on Medicare is going to drive down healthcare spending. Single payer will certainly decrease healthcare spending, but in every analysis I've read, it will not decrease spending a whole lot, at least not as much as enforcing cost controls.

&gt; In 2009, Forbes ranked health insurance as the 35th most profitable industry, with an anemic 2.2 percent return on revenue. To understand why the U.S. health-care system is so expensive, you need to travel higher up the Forbes list. The pharmaceutical industry was in third place, with a 19.9 percent return, and the medical products and equipment industry was right behind it, with a 16.3 percent return. Meanwhile, doctors are more likely than members of any other profession to have incomes in the top 1 percent.

Banning something because it looks scary and makes you feel better is one of the dumbest things and useless things to do if we want to combat gun violence.

You know what will put a dent in gun violence? Fix our education system, do something about income inequality, address mental health in a real way. Do all of this and aill actually see decrease in gun violence. 

The thing that bothers me about how people view gun violence is there are things that cause just as much death as guns (cars, alcohol)
And things that cause orders of magnitude more death (tobacco).

We know 50k people a year will die from alcohol. We know hundreds of thousands will die from tobacco. Even with all this regulation in place people will die yet we allow these to be bought and sold because all freedom comes with risk and se have decided the freedom is worth that risk. 

When people look at gun violence they just camt accept it and dont look at it through the same lens. Ive read hundreds of comments of people calling for outright bans. Hell there are entire subs dedicated to it. 

And I own pistol grip shotgun and a traditional stock shotgun. The difderence is negligible and for me is more about comfort. 

The lethality has far more to do with the user as a trained user of a standard stocked weapon of going to be far more accurate and quick to get on target and reload than a novice will be with pistol stock version. The same trained user with a pistol grip will see negligible difference in results.

":) OK. 

So your Point is ""you are wrong"" ""I am right"" ""becouse things""

the only Point you make: 

&gt;The rich becoming richer does not mean they are ""sucking"" money off the rich. It simply means they are making more money. 

Is at best an exercise on streching the meaning of words. (and you even mix up the words trying to do that. What you actualy wanted to say is:

&gt;The rich becoming richer does not mean they are ""sucking"" money off the **poor**. It simply means they are making more money. 

To clarify then, my original Point is exectly this:

""The People makeing more money end up having to pay less taxes in % then those who earn less money."" 

this is exectly the oposite to what should happen in a fair scociaty, and what common term ""contributung your share"" means.

A relativly well know example is warren buffet paying less then her secretary.

Nor did he deregulate the derivative market. That was done by Phil Gramm (see above), Bush's Banking Director, even against the advice of his own Party and Democrats. He specifically inserted language which prohibited oversight or regulation of the newly created derivitive instruments, the only financial instruments to have none.

"&gt; You're (intentionally, I'd suspect) misrepresenting the data.

I clearly explained how the linkage works in my post. I'm not misrepresenting it. 

&gt;The data you have linked does not suggest that there is a link between the two subreddits. The commenters from either group could be mutually exclusive.

It shows clusters. This statistically links groups of similar posting trends together. The primary link is Atheism and SFP, but the cluster extends to the other subs. 

&gt;I am a huge Sanders supporter and diehard anti-theist, but I wouldn't touch r/MensRights or r/KotakuInAction with a fucking 10 foot pole.

I think you may have misinterpreted the data a bit. 

For example, if the parameters were modified, I could easily create a link. Say I create a new account, and create a subreddit called /r/BernieSandersLovesFriedChicken. I use that account to only post of SFP and BSLFC. Then, I create a third account and only post on /r/BSLFC and /r/Beastality, I would create a unique cluster with /r/SFP, /r/BSLFC, and /r/Beastality.

The parameters in the query ensure that a few accounts won't bias the results. This data isn't saying that most subscribers for /r/SandersforPresident are also subscribers of /r/KotakuInAction. It shows that there is a unique clique of some redditors that cluster together by their comments on these subs. 

Also, keep in mind that the data is six months old. SFP was much smaller at that time. Now, with more subscribers, I would guess it has some more unique ""cliques."" ",7

Furthermore, why do you think it's impossible for Hillary to regulate Wall Street while also receiving money from certain entities within it? Please explain that to me in detail. Why can't she? What will prevent her from doing it? Did it not cross your mind that maybe the reason that the big banks give her money is because they feel like Hillary will be able to regulate Wall Street in such a way that they feel will be well-reasoned and stabilizing rather than piecemeal and populist? 

The Big Banks want Hillary to look out for their interests. But that does not mean that they expect her to coddle them, that does not mean that they expect Hillary to NOT REGULATE WALL STREET. That is not the expectation that these banks have. They know the regulation is coming, and they would just prefer it to come from a rational and intelligent individual that they have a good relationship with. Hillary has a relationship with some big banks, but that's not a bad thing. Working WITH rather than AGAINST is a good thing.

"&gt; The whole point of the Constitution is that it changes with the times.

The constitution didn't have to change to do away with slavery, women's suffrage, etc. In fact the justices had to appeal to exceptions from outside the constitution to ever rule such things constitutional to begin with. That is in fact the danger of allowing appeals to popularity decide what the exceptions should or shouldn't be. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't like originalism. I see it as nothing more than a poor attempt to re-invoke the same kind of exceptions to the constitution that slavery and women's suffrage was justified on. Just because these ideas were once socially acceptable enough that nobody complained too much about them did not make the exceptions justified. Just like public sentiment now shouldn't hold sway over the freedoms it provides. 

What the constitution is is the law of the law. Without it lawmakers can do whatever the hell they want without limitations. When you start demanding your exceptions be made without a constitutional amendment then it legitimizes those exceptions that allowed slavery. There is no longer ANY constraints on the constraints the state can put on you.

"The left often gets accused of lots of infighting, but everything I've seen that's a function of standards.  It's not good enough just to have your team win the Political Superbowl - it only counts if the person at the front is actually representing your ideals.

Think of the reverse scenario - someone like Governor Schwartzenegger running as a Republican and then following that up with a focus on social and climate issues.  He won over many right-wing voters with basically lip service knowing that they'd vote for a guy associated with war and guns.  Nobody really paid attention afterwards because their team won and that's what counts.

On the left there tends to be more resistance to that kind of thing, again at least from my experience.  And really, this isn't even so much about Hillarys over-all platform, it's that she had the gall to challenge Bernies primary message: that he wasn't enmeshed in the political financial system and that made him the perfect candidate to dismantle it.  She claimed that she was equally positioned on that front, which is an unequivocally false - over her career and her husbands career, they have been enmeshed in that system.  As you say, they have relationships and influence in (and therefore the ability to be influenced by) that system.  Sanders does not.

So where this is coming from is the Clintons made the mistake of trying to compete with Sanders on his strongest messaging - his main differentiation from the establishment - and now they're being taken to task for it because there's no substance there.  Hillary's intentions don't matter when it comes to the actual point that Sanders is pushing - he's not tied in, full-stop, whereas the Clintons are tied in and are asking you to trust them.

Under her plan, a patient could visit a doctor three times without it counting towards their annual deductible and families ineligible for Medicare could receive up to a $5,000 tax credit for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. She would also impose a $250 monthly cap on prescription drugs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions. Additionally, her plan would legalize prescription drug imports from Canada""

Seems to be the main concrete thing she's said, other than generic ""we need to get costs down"" kind of thing. And she also ran on basically the ACA in 2008, for whatever that counts for.

See, you can do it to both sides. 

&gt;I recognize this. I also recognize that some opinions aren't based in fact.

Neither side of the abortion debate is this type of opinion, and the issue is that you incorrectly recognize the abortion debate as a debate in which one side is supported by facts and the other isn't.

&gt;Haha, okay, that's why you equate abortions to killing poor people.

I'm not equating abortions to killing poor people. I'm saying that, by arguing that fetuses should be aborted to prevent people from growing up in poverty, you apparently misunderstand the pro-life argument.

Good thing you know better, because it would be pretty unreasonable to infer a threat from that.

Again: being pro-life is an opinion, and is thus neither inherently factually correct nor inherently factually incorrect. 

&gt;It is little more than a vegetable at that stage. It cannot reason, it cannot think, it cannot survive independently from its host.

So your criteria for when a human entity deserves the right to life involves it (a) being more than just 'a vegetable', (b) the capacity to reason/think, and (c) the ability to survive independently from its host.

But, let's not forget we are talking about the American electorate, who repeatedly votes against tax increases. A candidate who openly supports tax increases on the middle class will have tons of trouble in a general election.  Just take my very blue state of Minnesota as an example. Our governor ran on a platform of raising taxes for the highest earners to support more services and to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. He won and taxes were increased (and what a fight it was!). He narrowly won reelection, but the Dems lost many state house/senate seats and lost its majority in the state house. Again, this is Minnesota, one of the most progressive states in the country. My point is, even tax increases just for the wealthy have been tough sells. I don't think the electorate has much appetite for broad tax increases (even if you say it is just a little bit each pay check). ",2

For what it's worth, the people I know who work the hardest to get us good Democratic candidates (putting in a lot of work during the primaries) never consider sitting out the general, even if they don't particularly like some of the candidates who are up for election (though there's often at least someone worth voting for in the general).",3

However, because it is less than 80% complete, the ATF doesn't require it to have a registered serial number. It takes very little skill to complete this receiver, often comes with detailed instructions on how to do so, and it can go on to become an unregistered assault rifle known as a ""ghost gun"".

The intent of the product is obvious; it is made to circumvent registration laws. We should be requiring manufacturers to serialize what are obviously receivers, even when incomplete, before they are sold.

"&gt;Non-competes exist solely to protect a company's investment in training an employee, so that employee can't take their expertise to the competition the second they get a better job offer. NDAs cover sensitive information.

And the state clearly has an interest in protecting its investment in a political class, having given access to its resources to a political representative. So there is the same motive and the same mechanism as those agreements.

&gt;including a ""not profiting"" clause

This is clearly more broad than anyone is suggesting. 'not profiting' and 'not engaging in explicitly outlined political activities for profit' are two different things. Who outlines what those activities are I wonder? Is it just *me*? Do I come up with those and make them law right here on the internet? No, clearly, lawmakers, our elected representatives, the suggestion here is that *they* ought to craft the architecture of this variety of agreement.

And of course the logistics of implementing an agreement like this would be difficult, that is why we have a large and well trained group of legal professionals in this country. Do you think it is always easy to prove when an NDA has been broken? People are arguing that Clinton broke one as secretary of state, do they just drop the whole process because it is difficult to prove? No, because our political class has vast economic interests, and if it is profitable for the state to take a former politician to court to settle a disagreement over an agreement, then they will do exactly that.

"This is just a little anecdotal observation, but when I attended the Bernie rally at the University of Denver back in June 2015, I sat in the bleachers and looked out at the crowd of between 3k and 5.5k individuals (depending on the source), taking inventory of the different types of people present. There were certainly a lot of young folks in attendance (not just students, but young families too), but I was surprised to see that between 1/2 and 2/3 of the audience looked to be aged 30 or older. To my left was an older married couple (two women from Westminster that worked in human services and loved to chat), to my right was an elderly (and exceptionally pro-union) man and his rowdy wife (she didn't talk much, but shouted in support throughout Bernie's speech). 

I'm not sure if my experience was abnormal or if I subconsciously just saw what I wanted to see or something, but the Bernie rally in Denver appear to be chock full of older folks. ",4

I'm actually of an opinion that the minimum wage is a poor solution to a real problem. Barring a better solution, it's better than nothing. I'm no economist, so I don't know how this would work out and I'd be curious what professional economists would say about it, but I'd like to see the minimum wage complimented by another system based on a companies profit. Why not require companies to distribute a certain percentage of their profit back to their workers? If a company doesn't make much money in a certain year, or loses money, they could just pay minimum wage. If they made a ton of money, they could redistribute say 10% back to their employees every quarter or something. 

Sounds good to me, but like I said I'm no economist. ",-1
"Obviously Executive Orders orders can't violate any explicit provisions of the Constitution, nor override the prerogatives of Congress or the Judiciary, nor violate laws enacted by Congress, but beyond that I don't see anywhere in the Constitution where there is a general limitation on what the President may order be done. 

Not saying that ruling by decree is a good thing, but I don't see any obvious statement contained in the Constitution that prohibits the president that generally bars them from doing so if they see good purpose.

However I also understand that the restraint on this is and was intended always to be that the Congress can simply write a law that contravenes or prohibits whatever the President has ordered and unless it interferes with an explicit prerogative of the president, Congress's will would always prevail against any executive order.",1

&gt;My point is, a month ago Bernard was behind 9 in Iowa, while he is 26 points behind now in SC. The two situations are nothing a like, and then we haven't even started about demographics. 

That's all well and good but that's not the point *I* was making to which you originally responded. Bottom line is that Bernie closed the gap in Iowa and once momentum builds and he begins targeting ads the same will happen there, too most likely.

"&gt; Bernie Sanders was fighting for women's reproductive rights for for much longer than Hillary Clinton even took a public stance on the matter.

This claim is patently ridiculous. If there was any actual truth to it, it would be based on an unfair comparison that it is easier to know how long Bernie has favored abortion rights because his voting record is longer. Just because we can't have possibly known Hillary's record on reproductive healthcare decades ago does not mean that somehow she didn't favor it or that Bernie, on that particular issue, is somehow better.

What we do know is that BOTH candidates have 100% ratings from NARAL Pro-Choice America. This is a good thing.

By the way, this is not meant to be anti-Bernie at all. In fact, in a similar way, I think Bernie is shit on unfairly about gun control when in reality, he's not exactly an NRA puppet. But we should compare the candidates on fair merits. When it comes to reproductive rights, there's no way to ""call out"" Hillary. Just leave it at that.",10

"Ta-Nehisi Coates is doing it again.

Its an incredibly weak argument. And Coates clearly doesn't have the humility to accept criticism from anybody, even other black people.

You see, no one really understands the issue of reparations on such a deep level as Ta-Nehisi Coates. So this second article is devoted for elaborating how we all just don't get it, and he goes through each criticism with more bluster.

He's just doubling-down on his own ego. I don't think he is shilling for Hillary. But he is definitely shilling for himself, and he thinks no one is qualified to critique him or his points.

He started off by saying something along the lines of 

'And that TRAITOR, Edward Snowden, is still out there. He revealed our surveillance secrets to the world and harmed our national security. He showed that we were spying on Canada and Germany. He showed that we were spying on our friends.' 

Then he went on to talk about how you need to spy on your allies to make sure they are really your allies and you know what they will and won't support. He likened it to being an attorney who already knows the answers to his questions in a courtroom because of depositions. Then he complained about how Obama was appalled by these revelations and stopped the spying (doubtful) and that was a terrible thing. 

Now I can kind of see this point of view and the ideas are at least coherent if that's what you think, but then in the very next breath he starts talking about how Obama only wants to spy on Israel to make sure they didn't  mess with the Iranian deal ***and how that's a bad thing***.

"The USA spends nearly $10,000 per person per year on healthcare.

How does Sanders plan on dropping that to $5,000 per person per year?

Or is it more likely his tax plan is a lie?

And keep in mind, he cannot just double all taxes in his plan, that would have the highest rate at over %100 and over $250,000 at 74%.

That would kill small businesses and those that could afford to leave and hide their earnings overseas still would.

Sanders hasn't said how he would reduce costs because he won't and can't.

Expect a much larger number than that 2.2% tax he claims it will be on most people.

Either employers will pay a lot more (and cut jobs) or the middle class and barely making it will be squeezed into complete poverty.

A quick google search shows that pretty much everyone has doubts about Sanders numbers, and for good reason.  He is pushing numbers that make him look good and not the reality of the situation.",-1

However, contrast that tone and style of that hypothetical ad with Bernie's ad.  We don't even have the foreboding music when talking about Hillary. 

&gt;That aside, you're being manipulated, and you're loving it.

Well, must have been manipulated since 2010 when I heard his speech against extending the Bush tax cuts, then found out he opposed the Iraq war back in 2003, despite the heavy nationalistic drum beating that Hillary fell prey to.

I guess so you won't think I'm being manipulated, I have to vote for Hillary, a candidate who put forth ads [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yr7odFUARg).  Truth is, I don't like her policy stances at all and I think her political decisions are far too reactionary in response to public opinion rather than based on sincere belief or logical reasoning.  I have viewed her as a right of center politician (the same way Bill signed into law a slew of conservative policies as president while maintaining the position ""liberal"") and don't think her current positions represent her actual political beliefs and goals.

As for me, I was just graduating high school in 2003 and was against Iraq from the get go because even though I supported the invasion into Afghanistan, I thought there were too many with Afghanistan similarities that would lead to a repeat of Vietnam and was not convinced by the evidence of an eminent threat posed by Iraq, even though I respected Collin Powell greatly, I was doing JROTC and my Dad is retired Navy, enlisted.  

Turns out I was correct on both Afghanistan and Iraq.  I've since had eight years of post high school education and am now a practicing attorney with an extremely comfortable salary.  I was raised in a working class home, I worked my ass off holding a job while doing undergrad and law school to get where I'm at, and despite being successful, I think the ""system"" does not give the middle class a fair shake.  So I'm not voting for Sanders because he's going to ""give me free stuff.""  

I have identified with the far left for over a decade.  I was distrustful of Obama in '08, I knew he wasn't going to be the radical change a lot of people where hoping for, therefore I haven't been bitter about his presidency the way a lot of progressives have been.  I have the same reservations with with Sanders.  Is he going to get a lot of these things he promises done?  Of course not, but his recorded statements throughout the years has remained consistent and aligns with my political values.  So therefore I find him to be a better candidate for me than Hillary is.  The idea of a representative democracy is to vote for candidates who you think would best represent you and your beliefs.  Hillary does not do that for me.

The ultimate goal of Bernie's campaign, I believe, is to energize and draw progressive people out to vote to hopefully nominate other progressive candidates both locally and in congress.  However, the difficulty lies in seats coming from gerrymandered districts.

So there you have it, I'm simply being manipulated and do not have a legitimately nuanced position on why I would support Bernie over Hillary.",1

"&gt;""The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama,"" Cruz said. ""But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.""

But the ""mostly true"" claim is based on only the second part of Cruz's claim.

What Cruz does not factor in is:

*Just in time (JIT) manufacturing began in the 1960s and 1970s in Japan and spread to the U.S. in the 1980s. JIT manufacturing cut the need for producing large inventories and cut waste, both of which impact on jobs.

*Robotics began replacing blue collar workers in the mid 1970s and any manufacturing that returns to the U.S. is likely highly robotic requiring fewer employees than before.

*Microsoft Office was launched in 1990, resulting in many white collar jobs being merged or eliminated.

*In 2008 the volume of prime spenders (age 40+) dropped due to the trend that baby boomers over the previous 30 years had less kids than their parents, thus the population only grew due to the number of immigrants. Business many years before saw the declining market coming and went global bringing the jobs with them. 

*Yes, the affluent did well under Obama because the quantitative easing helped the top 50% of retail sales, that American Express' 2008 Survey on Wealth and Affluence claimed was due to the affluent spending, to keep it from dragging the economy down when the other 50% of retail sales plunged due to the financial crisis of 2008 and consumers way over their head in debt. So in order to drive the economy and keep our jobs, Obama needed keep the affluent spending. The affluent, you know the very same customers of Goldman Sachs where Cruz's wife works and where he got a loan. So I guess Obama efforts helped to keep his wife employed.",1

"This system exists on the state level in Washington. Objections on the basis of scope and object are made on the floor and can, if passed, be heard by the court: 

""Title / Subject and Scope and Object
Typically, staff drafting a bill also write the title of a bill under the mem-
ber’s direction. As stated in the “Titles/Single Subject Rule” of the Wash-
ington State Constitution (Article II, Section 19) unlike the US Congress, 
the state Legislature can only address one issue per bill, which must be 
clearly defined in the title of the bill. Objections based on the single sub-
ject rule and within the title rule are typically heard in the courts rather 
than in the Legislature. Therefore, if a bill with multiple subjects passes 
the Legislature without objection, it will become law; however, the consti-
tutionality of the law is still subject to challenge by the courts.
The state constitution also has a requirement stating, “No amendment to 
any bill shall be allowed which shall change the scope and object of the bill” 
(Article II, Section 38). Members wanting to challenge amendments on 
scope and object grounds generally do so during a floor session. When 
such a challenge has been presented, the presiding officer makes the 
decision.""

"I'm not Jewish, so take what I say with a grain of salt...

If the President wants to use Muslims as a scapegoat for America's problems, by banning them from the country and suggesting they be relegated to camps, that is fascist as hell and mirrors similar thinking that took place in Nazi Germany towards the Jews. Trump is using symbolism and ridiculous messaging (Freedom Girls singing ""deal from strength or get crushed every time,"" for example) to convince uneducated (and some educated) Americans that Muslims are the reason ""America isn't as great as it should be."" Firsty, there's the comparison to Nazi Germany. Secondly, let's say the Donald is elected and somehow gets America to act to ban Muslims and possible relocate them. Then America still remains in the same position it is now, because the real cause of America's problems aren't related to Muslims.

"You're suggesting a siege, which I don't see as the preferable solution here.  There are 4 possible outcomes to a siege: the surrounding force gives up, the surrounding force attacks, the besieged surrenders, or the besieged attacks. 

Outcome 1: Government gives up now. I've already outlined why that would be bad in another post, but it would be setting a dangerous precedent regarding property rights and negotiating with extremists - basically letting them win.

Outcome 2: Government attack - law enforcement have the ability to prepare and strategize their plan, will be well supplied and alert. Will have access to lethal and non lethal force to bring an end to the confrontation as soon as possible. Casualties are likely, fatalities are possible.

Outcome 3: Militia eventually surrender. Depending on how well supplied these militia men are, it could take months. Waco lasted more than 50 days. During that time, to maintain the siege, law enforcement officers must be stationed around the buildings 24/7.  If at any time the besieged decide to attack, law enforcement on site are at the disadvantage of being surprised and unprepared. Hundreds of thousands or millions of tax dollars are wasted, depending on how long they hold out before surrendering.  Casualties are likely, fatalities are possible.

Outcome 4: Besiege attack. Militia men watch law enforcement, determine when they are at their weakest and attack. Planning and element of surprise give the militia the advantage. Casualties are likely, fatalities are possible.

So out of 4 possible options, the one that puts the law enforcement officers in the least amount of danger for the least amount of time (other than the government just giving up and going home) is to initiate a planned raid using lethal and non-lethal force to end the standoff immediately.

You can't guarantee that no one dies by allowing the standoff to continue. The longer it goes on the more likely it will end violently. And if they did walk out eventually, they wouldn't look like fools, they would find a way to claim victory somehow.  Then they would defend themselves in court saying that the government unlawfully imprisoned them by denying them access to food and water during the siege and the charges will be dropped. ",1

&gt;They did decide, in [Heller](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html), paragraph 2a. They explicitly reject the 2A interpretation of an official militia rigidly controlled by Congress.

But that's not the definition of well regulated **as it is being proposed now** so its a false equivalence - ""well regulated"" in Heller still held that it **could** be regulated, just not on the terms of that case. So once again, this is for a judge to decide- not you. 

&gt;Don't go on a ""But Heller was crap"" tirade because you just set the criteria as a judge deciding, and they did, and not to your favor.

I won't, because it presupposes that you have won this argument. The judge decided, yes. But also not in your favor. They never said it couldn't be regulated at all, just the conditions of that case.

See, that is how court precedents work, and how subsequent decisions are based. Nothing is ever final, so when you say;

&gt;and they **did**, and not to your favor

You're just plain wrong, mostly because you don't understand how court cases work apparently.

But don't go on a tirade about how ""well Heller was crap"" because it didn't shut the door on regulating guns entirely. Which **is** what the judge decided then, and will be used as precedent now.

"When the question is does this tax raise mean I have to settle for 4 beach houses instead of 5, or you'll have to reduce the size of your private plane fleet by 1-2, or perhaps reductions in your house staff, then you are not paying your fair share. 

Fair share should not be based on how much you contribute, but how much you have left relative to the rest of the population. Pretending like $20,000 in taxes for someone making $100,000 is anything like paying $200,000 for someone making $1,000,000 is preposterous. The relative spending power and financial safety puts the person paying more taxes in a much better position without question. 

Does this mean the current American Royalty needs to accept their position threatened? Absolutely! We allow people to reap benefits for peanuts. The self-made man is a farce. No one did it all on their own.

"&gt; WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Obama administration confirmed for the first time Friday that Hillary Clinton's unsecured home server contained closely guarded government secrets, censoring 22 emails with material requiring one of the highest levels of classification. The revelation comes just three days before the Iowa presidential nominating caucuses in which Clinton is a candidate.

&gt; But The Associated Press has learned seven email chains are being withheld in full from the Friday release because they contain information deemed to be ""top secret."" The 37 pages include messages recently described by a key intelligence official as concerning so-called ""special access programs"" - a highly restricted subset of classified material that could point to confidential sources or clandestine programs like drone strikes or government eavesdropping.

So, if Hilliary is unable handle classified material in a responsible way, how can she be qualified to be President?  This goes to the heart of the matter.",396

Donors were pitted against each other to see who could raise more and be in the good graces of the man who, at the time, was described by many in Bush World as the inevitable nominee.

And now that he won't win the nomination isn't not like his donors will just close up shop and go home, they're waiting to contribute to the next campaign, and the next one after that. 

&gt;POLITICO talked to nearly two dozen major donors, and most say they are waiting for what one veteran Republican and former Bush 43 administration appointee described as the ""family hall pass"" to jump to another campaign after the New Hampshire primary.

Unless you have a people-powered campaign, like those of Ben Carson and Bernie Sanders, you're completely reliant on appealing to the benign benefactors for funding, so the campaigns which are able to be successful are required to pass through a set of filters that determine the inevitable shape of the race.

We allegedly have 3 independent branches of government but if the only way we can have any influence on the all-important Court (an agency which history has shown to have too few safeguards and that I'm coming to the conclusion should not involve life appointments) is to indirectly influence it by Presidential choice, then there is no way to simultaneously affect the President and the Court.

The typical turn out for primaries is as low as 20%. He's rallying people who have never been involved in the political process. It's really difficult to speculate on who's going to win based on previous elections and polling.  Let's just imagine if 20% of those polled showed up to vote Hillary (typical turnout) and 100% of those polled show up to vote for Bernie (who has a loyal committed base). That turn out would result in Bernie winning by a landslide.

"no problem ",3
Tu quoque.,1
"Sure.

You claim;

* Premise 1) ""A fascist president could never take power in America, McArdle argues, because, among other things, “America has neither the weak institutions nor the revolutionary organizations necessary for a Trump Reich to fester.” But that’s not quite true. FDR may not have been Hitler or Mussolini. But the difference was one of degree, not of kind."".

This is utter nonsense. Social welfare projects don't automatically equate to fascism. There are dozens of European countries that have been using various implementations of democratic socialism to try and improve social functions. Doing so does not automatically make a country fascist. This seems to be a difficult topic for you folks on the right to grasp, but in reality specific words have specific meanings. 

Heres the definition from Miram-Webster;

Definition 1) a political philosophy, movement, or regime (as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition

Definition 2) a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control.

* Premise 2) ""FDR spied on political dissidents in the name of national security. In May 1940, he warned of a “fifth column” in America (a military term for civilian rebels), and claimed refugees might be enemy agents."" 

So has every other single President since, that doesn't make it right. Additionally since Trump hasn't yet been made President, this cannot be said to actually constitute a ""parallel"" between the two. 

* Premise 3) ""All of this was before FDR rounded up almost 122,000 Japanese-Americans and forced them into internment camps."" 

Most modern liberals at least agree that this was unconstitutional, are you suggesting that because FDR did it during WWII, it should be acceptable for us to again round up a group of people based on race and isolate them today? I hope not. It was wrong then when we were at war with the Japanese, it's likely to be even more wrong now. 

* Premise 4) ""FDR was also hostile towards refugees. When Jews sought to escape from Nazi Germany, FDR barred the gates. The State Department cut refugee immigration by 75 percent by imposing burdensome regulations.""

I've heard this claim before, most historians agree it was a huge mistake, as do most people, so are you intending to suggest that its moral now in the case of Trump because FDR did it during WWII, or are you intending to suggest that we should cut immigration by 75% during non-war time? So your objective to make it look beneficial is based on what criteria again? Is that what you're even arguing for?

* Premise 5) ""The New Deal’s Not So Different from Fascism""

This only further proves that not only do you not know what the term ""fascism"" means, but that you think its okay to associate any social welfare project with the concept of fascism for your own purposes. 

* Premise 6) ""Like Trump, FDR had little respect for the separation of powers. When he tried to pass a 99.5 percent marginal tax rate on income above $100,000, Congress rebuffed him.""

Trump has never suggested such a tax rate, and has not as of yet provided a definitive tax plan; likewise FDR never suggested a tax rate of 99.5 percent. You are making up history. The highest marginal tax rates were put in place under Eisenhower. 

Your writing ignores virtually all historical context of the second world war, it ignores the definition of ""fascism"", and it has almost no regard for facts. Not a single item in your blog article is sourced, and yet you think its perfectly okay to compare the author of the New Deal to a ""fascist"" and then erroneously conflate him with Trump.

Just for the record, I was a professional ghostwriter for two years, though I don't particularly give a shit to waste the time or effort writing seriously on reddit. The majority of the time I give someone a sincere response on this website, they ignore everything I've said; and bitch about something completely unrelated to what I attempted to address.

That being said, your writing is so utterly unclear and devoid of factual reference, that the argument you're trying to make in your post cannot even be discerned. Should I hate FDR style Democrats for being ""fascists"" or hate Trump for your imagined connection between him and FDR's policies? Were the New Deal policies ""fascist"" even though they weren't autocratic? Does this make Sanders the same as Trump since he has a large assortment of planned social programs? What point of view are you even arguing from?

But at the end of the day, it seems true that most people can't define any of them accurately, even those who use the terms and think they know what they actually mean (/r/conservative springs to mind). I mean, even I've read the definitions between them a half dozen times in the past few months and I still can't recall their definitions (but I also don't have a strong political background, so, my memory isn't good for that type of information to stick).",4

"&gt; It's wrong if it introduces non-negligible conflicts of interest into the regulatory system. Which regulatory capture does. 

 Prove it.

&gt; It's easier not to enforce regulations against friends and former coworkers and to let possibly unethical or illegal behavior slide because ""that's just how industry works."" I mean, imagine if we had people objectively come in and rated those subprime backed securities that the ratings agencies with due diligence.

 That's not regulatory capture. Those securities were rated by S&amp;P and Moody's, not by any regulatory board. And the biggest reason they are not rated by a regulatory board is because there is not enough talent to do so, there is not enough regulatory capture. There are not enough talented people to determine risk now, that is the major problem. Do you think banks like losing money when things go wrong? Of course not, they welcome fair and educated regulation but there isn't any. There are several books on the topic, I challenge you to read up on it.

&gt; The fact is that efficiency and ease of operation do not equate to best possible outcome for the American public,

 I don't accept that as fact and neither should you. That's ridiculous, of course that's what we should be striving for.. and frankly we are already leagues ahead of the rest of the world in this department.

&gt; So no, I certainly do not want the finance industry to succeed unchecked.

 They are not unchecked, they are amongst the most highly regulated industries. There are armies of regulators and compliance officers. When it comes to regulation, it's not quantity that matters, it's quality. And that's what ""Wall Street"" has been saying, but politicians and Joe Sixpack think they're smarter.

 And if you don't want them to succeed, it just shows ignorance (no offense).

&gt; Because their interests and the interests of the government should not and do not coincide.

 Think about how ridiculous that statement is. How on earth do you come to that conclusion? You clearly don't understand our financial industry or any financial industry. Think about how they make money, why wouldn't they want more business, more jobs, money flowing, etc... ",-1

"It's not as helpful as the average person may think though. Say that the $40k deduction can be carried forward, the parents haven't already taken it for themselves, and that the student got a $40k/year job right out of college. Let's say they can use $25k of their tuition deduction in the first year since they already have other deductions. So that $25k worth of deductions will save around $3300 in the first year. The remaining 15k will obviously save less than that the second year. It's like getting a 15-20% rebate on tuition.

It's a step in the right direction though, true. If we are talking about potential deductions, I'd rather just have all interest/principal payments on student loans be deductible above the line (whereas currently it's just interest and its stupidly limited to a small dollar amount). That way you don't have to carry anything, parents wouldn't have a shot at it, and it would affect those of us currently paying off student loans. Also, as you got higher paying jobs allowing you to pay more down, your deduction would be worth more since you might be in a higher tax bracket at that point.",2

"&gt;Elected officials are not then actually representative of their constituents

Your individual choice to vote changes whether or not elected officials are representative of their constituents? You are one powerful motherfucker.

&gt;It could just as easily have been 93457 to 93456.

A mere handful of elections at the local level have come down to a single vote over the past 100+ years. Do you normally base your decisions on events that have only happened at small scale a handful of times over the past 100+ years?

Do you really believe any given election could ""just as easily"" have come down to a single vote rather than more than a single vote?

&gt;The point is that the only way to truly know what candidate any given electorate supports is for everyone to vote.

The same candidate is going to win whether you vote or you don't vote (except in that handful of cases at the local level). If the same candidate would have won whether you personally chose to vote or you didn't, how does your choice change whether or not the election reflects who the electorate supports?

&gt;It's the end result of everyone adopting your mindset.

So your assertion is that democracy can only work if the people are under the mass delusion that it makes a difference if they vote? I agree with that statement.

&gt;Do you want to see a good example of what happens when people don't vote? Look at the current members in office for the federal government. When a larger percent of the population turns up to vote, a democrat is elected president. Elections from non-presidential years have a much lower turnout and republicans have dominated those recently because they maintain better turnout for those elections.

No one doubts that if huge numbers of people choose not to vote, the outcome can be different. That's totally obvious. The point is that your personal contribution is irrelevant, and that's also the case for every single other individual. Unless there is delusion on a massive scale tricking people into thinking that it matters if they personally vote, democracy cannot function.",1

[FactCheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/06/where-does-clinton-foundation-money-go/)

Charity Navigator:

&gt;**We have determined that this charity’s atypical business model can not be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity.** 


&gt;We spoke by phone with Sandra Minuitti at Charity Navigator, and she told us Charity Navigator decided not to rate the Clinton Foundation because the foundation spun off some entities (chiefly the Health Access Initiative) and then later brought some, like the Clinton Global Initiative, back into the fold. Charity Navigator looks at a charity’s performance over time, she said, and those spin-offs could result in a skewed picture using its analysis model. If the foundation maintains its current structure for several years, she said, Charity Navigator will be able to rate it again.
The decision to withhold a rating had nothing to do with concerns about the Clinton Foundation’s charitable work. ",18
"Nobody, and I mean, nobody was ushered into the White House with more enthusiasm than Barack Obama... and look how well all that worked? The republicans still did everything they could to block his agenda.

"&gt; But you have to admit that it's better today than it used to be thanks to smart regulation. 

Perhaps, but many things are better today than they once were. That's called progress. We understand more about good hygiene, germs and sterilization etc. than we once did, simply because of natural progress. It wasn't regulation that gave us automatic hand dryers and sinks in restrooms, for example, just progress. If government went away it doesn't mean these things would.

&gt;I agree that the market should be given a chance to work on it's own, but what that means to me is different than your typical Libertarian.

Not really. People don't always have time to go into details and nuances, so they just shout out the basics: free markets! etc. The pendulum swinging from liberty to big govt and back has happened repeatedly. It's nothing new.

&gt;But the complexities of the real world often get in the way when it comes to creating a fair and balanced game for all players.

Well that's a key problem right there. The problem we have now is govt trying to manipulate the game has manipulated it for the wealthy, because (surprise) they most influence (big) government.

&gt;IMHO Libertarians make the mistake of blaming failures of the market on government rules, while exalting successes as the result of the free market.

Maybe you're not debating the right libertarians. Ones I know (like myself) try to back up claims with specifics. Quick example of a govt intervention approach: you may have heard of a company called Solyndra. Obama was big on solar energy and gave this rich(!) guy like a  half billion dollars to make solar panels in a classic govt, non-free market, approach. That company is already bankrupt. In a free market that bad company would never have been so well funded in the first place, but govt inefficiency and waste etc made it possible, and who knows what competing entrepreneurs were squashed out of the game, missed the resources etc in the meantime.

Now I'll give an example of free market success: Elon Musk. He had to lobby the govt for the right to even make rockets (prior govt contractors had a monopoly) and recently returned a launched rocket back to earth for re-use in a historic event.  

I mean, this stuff is night and day obvious.

&gt;But the free market is not immune to corruption and waste.

I agree. As I said it should be complemented with smart regulation. I think we agree there.

&gt;because they have obtained monopolistic power

Libertarians are not for monopolies, fraud, unfair business practices etc. Again, small effective government can combat this.

&gt;I have a personal preference for knowledge that's considered credible.

So do I. I'm just telling you the source isn't always the only clue to that. Don't get me wrong. It can be, of course. It depends what we're talking about. For example, if we're discussing math, then certainly, bring on the credentials. Institutions home to Fields Medal recipients should certainly be given deference, for example. But if we're talking economics, that's an imprecise science/field as is politics which deals with human behavior. 

&gt;There's a lot of information on the internet, you have to have some metric to identify what is and isn't worth your time.

True. That's why you ask for citations and/or proof to back up claims so you can do your own research and form your own conclusions.",1
"&gt; And that's the attitude that most in power have. It's why things don't get done

You seem to have to go to extreme in everything.  Do you think for a second if Bernie is elected, that the system of healthcare in America will change?  Do you honestly believe that?

I do agree that we have to be careful about who we send and where.  But even when the Democrats had a huge majority in the House and 59 votes in the Senate, they had to bribe their way to get the ACA passed.   Even then they used procedural moves to get it done.

Wanting things to change and expecting them to change are different, and living your life in the eyes of how it should be versus how it really is, isn't very productive at all is it?

"Iowa isn't irrelevant, though. It set McCain up for victory in 2008. Had Romney eked out a win, it would've also probably given him the momentum to win New Hampshire and McCain would've ultimately lost the entire race. Four years later, while Romney still 'lost', it was essentially a statistical tie - and the loss ultimately killed the Paul campaign, who was really banking on gaining momentum out of a win there (Santorum finished 1st, with 24.56%, Romney second with 24.53% and Paul third with 21.43%). 

I agree that if Trump only loses by .3%, as Romney did in 2012, it'll be less an issue. But if he loses by a larger margin, and it's conclusive (Santorum wasn't even named the winner of Iowa until days after - after Romney had initially been declared), all bets are off. 

The thing is, Trump has to prove he can win - as all outsider campaigns have to prove at a certain point. If he loses Iowa, NH becomes infinitely more important for his campaign and that's where someone like Rubio, who's polling rather well there compared to Iowa, can swoop in and win.

Here is the basic fact. Flint, Detroit, and other post-industrial cities can't afford to maintain their infrastructure because the tax base is a fraction of what it once was. It is not ""corporate"" governance.

Further, municipalities are not sovereign entities under the constitution, and can be altered by the state legislature. The state of Michigan had to do something about the fact that Flint was bankrupt, and the water crisis is the result of failed and short - sighted leadership, pure and simple.

As always, everywhere, it is the poor that suffer.

The fact that this is even possible in America, today, is just insane. BOTH parties allowed the conditions for the middle class industrial economy to die. The Democrats push ever more regulation while the Republicans are traitors who allow whole communities to suffer when they induce corporations to leave for Mexico or China.

Michigan could have evolved to something like Germany is today, a thriving high tech manufactring powerhouse, but it didn't, due to the shortsightedness of our politics.

"The whole article is about state-level polls and how they're not predictive. And yet you want to take it as a given that Sanders will certainly win both Iowa (where he's not even leading at present) and New Hampshire, and use that as your primary argument that he's got a very good chance nationally. But when I say ""hey, national polls have Hillary up 20,"" suddenly polls aren't predictive. If polls aren't predictive, why do you think Sanders will win New Hampshire? Personally, I think he *does* have a good shot in that state, but then again, I think polls are meaningful.",1

"So I'm not going to blame myself for my money being used to save my job and my 401k when it shouldn't have been jeopardized in the first place.  If we're going back in time then let's go back a bit further and stop it from happening.

I was working at a factory around 08-09, and I saw more than a few guys cash out $40k + because they didn't know what was going to happen.  One guy had a wife with MS (and this was still before the ACA, and we had good insurance).  The official company line was just don't look at your 401k right now.  It will get better.  

This was a food service business that primarily made vegetable oil, a commodity, and proved to be very robust against the recession.  People still ate at McDonald's, Wendy's, KFC, and other places during then.  We didn't have layoffs, but my 18-20 year old ass with not much of a 401k got to watch these guys panic as they just lost, and lost, and lost more.

Oilseed workers didn't have an ounce of control in the pension that they and the company contributed to.  FUCK YOU if you planned on cashing that 401k out to retire those years.",4

"&gt;That you guys dont have it has nothing to do with republicans congress childishly blocking the progress

No. It doesn't. When the ACA passed, Democrats controlled both houses of Congress and the Presidency. They attempted to include a public option, essentially a single-payer option that people could choose if they wanted it, and they could not get enough Democrats to support it. The law only passed after the public option was removed. The private insurance lobby is too strong and controls both parties. 

&gt;Whats the main difference between the US and canada, how it wouldn't work there, but does if you cross the border.

The difference is purely political. I'm sure it would work fine here as it does in Canada. That doesn't mean it can become a law in our current political climate and system. Half of the people in this country think that healthcare in Canada is terrible and that people regularly die waiting for care. Additionally, the private health insurance companies are a very influential lobby in Congress and a single-payer system would crush their profits. It won't happen. ",1
"Hm. Well I think that as a whole, most people probably want what is best for everyone. From Trump to Cruz to Hillary to Bernie, I think they have no true malice in their goals. 

The methods to get to their goal of giving everyone happiness may differ. 

Granted: Bernie is the man. However: 

If you have politician X, who has a corporate mindset and is, for some reason malicious (maybe they are a power-hungry psychopath, as politics attracts those types), then would you rather have person X also be desperate for money and thus beholden to big, corporate fat-cats? or would you rather that person X *is* a corporate fat-cat who doesn't have desperation because they aren't beholden to the other cats? 

This is what the debate comes down to. I think it is easier to relate to one person, even if they are a fat-cat, than to relate to a desperate-for-money person, as you then cannot relate to how all the corporations feel (these entities that want to pay low wages and destroy the environment).

"&gt; She is trying to exploit the public’s unfamiliarity with the distinction between classified documents and classified INFORMATION – the former are obviously classified because they are marked as such; the latter, because of its nature, is well known to national security officials to be classified – regardless of whether it is marked as such or even written down at all.

So name one person who has been prosecuted over unmarked classified information?

Jounralists have tried and found NOTHING, maybe Team JEB! and his lawyer pals can dig something up.

My source

 
 &gt;First, experts say, there’s no legal difference whether Clinton and her aides passed sensitive information using her private server or the official “state.gov” account that many now argue should have been used. Neither system is authorized for transmitting classified information. Second, prosecution of such violations is extremely rare. Lax security procedures are taken seriously, but they’re generally seen as administrative matters. Potential criminal violations arise when officials knowingly disseminate documents marked as classified to unauthorized officials or on unclassified systems, or otherwise misuse classified materials. That happened in two cases involving former CIA directors that are cited as parallels for the Clinton e-mail issue, but are quite different. .... Neither case fits the fact pattern with the Clinton e-mails.

"Exactly. 

The facts are if Sanders loses by narrow margin the energized voters he reached will most likely stay home on election night. I really think the Democratic Party is in worse shape than the GOP with Trump.

Republicans can get their base and the energized Trump supporters to show up. Democrats will suffer losses in voter turnout and some Sanders supporters might jump ship for the anti-establishment guy (dumb but what can you do..)",0

"Easy question, easy answer.  He has divided the nation, even more so than Bush before him.

This isn't rocket science.  This is what Presidents who were former Senators do.  They divide people because their best trait is arguing in the Senate.  It's their job to argue and vote for their side, not make deals.

If you vote Cruz you'll alienate the left and if you vote Sanders you'll alienate the right.  Putting a nationalist in like Trump is the only way to unite the nation, not with a conservative or a liberal career Senator.",0

The entitlement generations of the last few decades, including my own millennial generation, is so caught up in the true greed of socialism that it ignores the immorality of forcing others to pay for your expenses, the anti-American nature of big government, and not to mention the economy killing and debt loading nature of plans like those of Sanders.

Sanders likes to talk about the European socialist nations?  Has he taken a look that direction recently?  One by one, the socialist nations of Europe are either collapsing or reforming into more moderate versions of themselves year over year because the model of socialism is simply not sustainable.",-3

People who think it's impossible to get what you want in Washington so they give up before they even try. Hillary Clinton wants the same things as Bernie Sanders theoretically if money really has no influence. She wants versions of the same thing Sanders wants. The difference is she is starting her negotiations from a place of weakness saying we can't get $15 we can't get universal health care, we can't get free public tuition.

Forget that we are talking about Bernie Sanders. Forget that we are talking about 21st century politics. We're talking about history and fate. Freedom begins with insight into possibility and intelligent beings relate to possibility through supposition. So let's suppose. Suppose that we believe in fate because there is evidence it exists, but that the evidence exists only because we believe in it. Suppose we've mistaken the cause (the belief in fate) for the effect (the prison of fate) and thereby trapped ourselves.

This isn't gravity or DNA, this is human activity and human history. Suppose the remedy to fate (as an affliction) is as simple as parting with superstitious belief in fate, that the superstition turns out to be just a guise through which we had been inflicting an unhappy necessity upon ourselves?

A band of twelve or so Loyal Freedom-Loving Patriots joins him, they get some media exposure, and then realize they're freezing their asses off, they have to ask their internet patriot brothers for snacks, and then...nothing. The press goes home. The feds don't show. The local cops don't give a shit. No one's got them penned in, no one's tailing them as they leave their commandeered compound to get more snacks at the Circle K down the road. And then one by one Ammon's patriot compadres tell him about their mundane concerns back home that they need to attend to, and they all drive off.

""Hey, Ammon...soooo...Britney's got a home-schooling convention to go to tomorrow, and no one's there to watch Remington, Winchester, Colt, and Luger.""

Ammon's left standing in front of an empty federal building totally alone with no one watching. Complete anti-climax.

It’s not that gun control is bad, it’s that generally any reasonable/thought-out solution is utterly squashed and perverted by conservatives into being an attack on the 2nd amendment. Why is this a problem? Because it’s another boon for the GOP which is otherwise struggling to garner enthusiasm and mobilize support for their candidates. They have an ace in the hole however, and that’s the gun issue and telling people that democrats are out to seize/take their guns. This issue was just handed to the GOP on a platter, and they will now be able to run and focus attention on it to whip up the base even more, reap donations, and mobilize additional support. All of this means they can focus less on articulating solutions for the economy, foreign policy, or other issues. It's a gimmie copout. All the GOP has to do is say “SEE WHAT DEY DOING?

This detention limit can be triggered when a country simply refuses to accept repatriation of its national, irrespective of the individual’s criminal history.

"&gt; #DNC pressed to remove Wasserman Schultz amid Clinton favoritism charges#
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; By Ben Wolfgang
&gt; 
&gt; The Washingtion Times  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Amid charges that she is blatantly tipping the presidential primary scales in favor of Hillary Clinton, Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is coming under fresh fire from progressives who want her removed from her post immediately.
&gt; 
&gt; The progressive advocacy group RootsAction said Tuesday that a 4-day-old petition calling for Ms. Wasserman Schultz’s ouster had received 23,000 signatures. Ms. Wasserman Schultz’s detractors argue that she has wounded the Democratic Party’s credibility by essentially rigging the presidential primary process in favor of Mrs. Clinton.
&gt; 
&gt; “The head of one of the two big political parties in the United States is trying to manipulate the presidential election process by limiting direct debate and tilting the national party apparatus in favor of one candidate. This is unacceptable,” RootsAction.org co-founder Norman Solomon said in a statement.
&gt; 
&gt; For months, the DNC — and Ms. Wasserman Schultz in particular — has faced charges that it wants to make the primary process as smooth as possible for Mrs. Clinton while limiting opportunities for other candidates such as Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, a liberal favorite.
&gt; 
&gt; RootsAction and other critics say specifically that Ms. Wasserman Schultz has used the party’s primary debate schedule to reduce media exposure for Mr. Sanders and the party’s other presidential candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.
&gt; 
&gt; The DNC is holding six official debates this primary season. Several of those have been held over weekends, when TV viewership typically is lower. The next debate is scheduled for Jan. 17, a Sunday.
&gt; 
&gt; “The results, thus far, have been bad from the perspective of Wasserman Schultz’s own party, including domination of the media’s extensive election coverage by the other big party. Another result has been reduced exposure for the Democratic candidate polling strongest against Republican rivals, Bernie Sanders,” RootsAction co-founder Jeff Cohen said.
&gt; 
&gt; Critics say another example of favoritism toward the Clinton campaign is the fact that the DNC last month temporarily cut off the Sanders camp’s access to crucial voter files kept by the party.
&gt; 
&gt; The ordeal began when a Sanders staffer accessed private data belonging to the Clinton campaign. Although Mr. Sanders acknowledged his campaign’s error, he, along with supporters and critics of the DNC, argued that it was a massive overreaction to suspend his access to the party’s voter file.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Sanders’ access to the voter file was restored after he filed a lawsuit.

If all those other states simply don't yet know Sanders as well, why does she not lead in those states by 50 points among white people as well?",0

No, it wouldn't exist because it never went into the pocket of the million workers who got paid from all the wealth created.

Remember, both sides of the equation are unequal.

 * Value = What people are willing to pay for your product

 * Value - Cost of base materials to build your product = Wealth Created

 * Wealth Created - Wages of everyone you have to pay to make the product = Profit

So everyone wages, everywhere, is paid out in wealth that is created by whatever product is being made.

I own my own labor.  I can sell it to someone at a mutually agreed upon amount.  No-one is forcing me to undersell myself.  Me working for a dude who made a billion dollars last year doesn't mean fuck all.  If he's paying me fair market wages, he hasn't stolen a thing from me just because of how much he made last year.

He's not wrong. It's common knowledge that the US was founded on Juedo-Christian principles.

"It could mean that Clinton may over perform. But when taking into account a variety of variables, signs point more towards Bernie over performing. 

1) Bernie does better with Independents, Republicans, former politically apathetics, and young people. Polls often don't take these groups into account or weigh them as highly as other demographics. This may mean that his poll numbers are more likely a bit higher than they are lower, although Clinton's are probably more accurate as she represents the establishment which can be more easily polled. 

2) Bernie supporters have a lot more enthusiasm (though maybe not the volunteer experience) than Clinton supporters. In caucus states, you need to have a lot of excitement and dedication to turn out for your candidate. Iowa, being the first state and a caucus state, may see Bernie supporters turn out in higher percentages than Hillary supporters. 

And now, obviously this doesn't mean much as it's just anecdotal, but from my experience as a college organizer, past stereotypes about young voters are being decimated.

"There were never more than 4million slaves in the US even at the height of slavery, Jews controlled the entire Triangle Trade and owned a huge number of the slaves in America. Many whites also came to America as indentured servants.

&gt; People of color in the United States do not have the accumulated family wealth that white families have due to systematic discrimination and involuntary servitude over hundreds of years.

Those were tribal times where every race stayed with their ethnic tribe. Whites didn't wait around for some other race to provide them opportunities, they made their own opportunities. Why were whites obligated to do things for other races that they should have been doing for themselves?

&gt; Allowing the free market to reign supreme is therefore racist in practice.

As opposed to socialism/communism where everyone (except for the communist Jews that run things under that system) suffers from a system that is not economically viable. Socialism failed every place it was tried whether it's the USSR, China under Mao, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba under Castro, South Africa under Nelson Mandela's communist ANC, Zimbabwe under Robert ""I don't want to see white faces even though my country has no skilled labor and cannot function without whites"" Mugabe, or Venezuela under Chavez, etc. ALL MASSIVE FAILURES. Maybe socialism is the reason your country of origin is so messed up that you can't make progress there.

Every time there's been a communist revolution in any country, it's always a similar process: Socialist leftists promising racial and economic equality win elections, intelligent and skilled people fight it and are killed by simpletons who do not realize the value they add to the country; simply viewing them as the Bourgeoisie class that has to go for there to be equality. This is how communists socially engineer the new society by killing off the people who built and maintained the old society. The new society always turns out a disaster with a terrible economy, low wages, high inflation and the country loses all their intellectual capital and has a serious shortage of high skilled labor because all the top architects, engineers, construction workers and managers, etc. are always the first people killed in the revolution.",2

This sub and /r/sandersforpresident both were outraged that the 71% could impose their support against the will of the others.

"Not exactly. If Glass-Steagall had stayed in place, the crash simply wouldn't have happened the way it did, if at all. 

Why, you ask? Well, it's because the repeal of Glass-Steagall allowed individual banks to work as both investment banks *and* savings banks. When they got severely overleveraged on the investment side, it took the savings side down with it, because it was the same bank on both sides. 

Prior to the repeal of Glass-Steagall, no savings banks would have collapsed, because none of them would have possessed the toxic sub-prime securities in the first place. 

Would there have been a sub-prime crisis? Maybe, but probably not, because the investment dollars simply wouldn't have been available to create a bubble like the one in '06. Would the sub-prime crisis have caused a ripple effect of deleveraging across the economy? No, because the savings banks would have been insulated from the crash to a much greater degree.

Nevermind Bundy is an overt racist!

Your hero

&gt; I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro,” he said. Mr. Bundy recalled driving past a public-housing project in North Las Vegas, “and in front of that government house the door was usually open and the older people and the kids — and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch — they didn’t have nothing to do. They didn’t have nothing for their kids to do. They didn’t have nothing for their young girls to do.

&gt; And because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do?” he asked. “They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I’ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.”",2

“In order to change an existing paradigm you do not struggle to try and change the problematic model. You create a new model and make the old one obsolete.” - R. Buckminster Fuller

Bernie Sanders is the only man on the political landscape with the will to do just this. I have seen nothing from any other candidate, Democrat or GOP, that inspires me.",2
"Ok, well I didn't want to get into this, but whatever.

First and foremost, this was introduced by a conservative member of the House. So, that, in and of itself, would indicate it isn't necessarily a progressive platform. Also, [many states](https://ballotpedia.org/Single-subject_rule) have single-subject laws as part of their constitutions. Some historically conservative, some historically liberal. This would add to the assessment that single-subject laws are in a plethora of different political landscapes, some of which are staunchly conservative.

Second, this:

&gt; ANY bill can be viewed as progressive, centrist, conservative, anarchist, etc. even though it can help and hinder all parties dependent on the time.

Is just an inaccurate statement. Could a bill pushing for getting rid of the EPA be considered progressive? I don't think so. On the flip side, could Bernie's legislation around taxing speculation be considered conservative? Nope. Just two (extreme) examples that fly in the face of your assumption that ""ANY"" bill can progressive, conservative, etc. This is nit picky, but you made the statement.

Third, your sources are terrible. The quote you referenced ""Trust, honesty, open communication"" cannot even be correctly sourced because it links to a defunct webpage. And that defunct page was a blog. And the other source is simply a quote. Using the source you provided, the pillars of progressiveness are: Freedom, Opportunity, Responsibility, and Cooperation. I don't see fairness listed. 

Fourth, do you really think progressives have a monopoly on ""fairness?"" Fairness is such a broad term it is ridiculous to point to that as a platform of particular party. Ask a Democrat and fairness might mean taxing the 1% at higher rates. Ask a Republican and fairness could mean not raising taxes and taking ""their"" money for others. Fairness is a subjective term, not owned by one party. Fairness is in the eye of the beholder. 

&gt; open discourse

Once again, this is a broad term that can't necessarily be pointed back progressives or conservatives. For example, [here](http://thefederalist.com/2014/03/19/why-liberals-attempt-to-silence-honest-debate/) is a post from a highly conservative posting (I chose a super biased for a reason) that laments the Democrats for being the ones holding back open discourse. Once  again, like fairness, open discourse is in the eye of the beholder.

Essentially, I am arguing that the single-subject bill is neither progressive or conservative. If you polled conservatives you would like a litany of reasons why a bill like this would fall in line with conservative principals. The same could be said for progressives if they were polled.

This is simply an intelligent bill. This is simply a bill that helps Americans. One that makes sense for both parties when it serves them best, and will hinder them at times as well. That is why it is not solely a progressive idea.

"&gt;His parents were immigrants fleeing Castro in the 60s, his father was a bartender and his mother was a housekeeper.

A paid housekeeper in Cuba before Castro? Must have been the only one. You do realize that Castro broke Cuba's 400 year old history of being a criminal haven and a port for trading slaves and the reason America refused refugees is that most were former slave owners. The whole reason for our initial spat with Cuba was because Castro destroyed an exclusive playground for America's elite. 99% of those first waves are only poor because Castro took their hotels and brothels and the reason they came here was because Castro was executing slave owners.  The Cuba Revolution was *supposed* to be Democratic, but Kennedy decided to be an ass and left Castro with no other choice but to turn to Russia for aid. The circumstances behind the Cuban Revolution and the general demographic of those first waves of refugees really makes the public family stories of these candidates questionable. I would not be surprised to find that both Cruz and Rubio had family in the Cuban hotel business or in control of the portage (both positions had political significance in pre Castro Cuba). Legacy to the GOP is two things: It is either family legacy or legacy of action, specifically action that ends with a firm greasing of the palms of the powers that be. Either way excepting Trump, there are no GOP upstarts. If you are backed by the GOP it is because you have been put through a fine filter and passed their meddle.  Being rich isn't enough. It is how you got rich as well as how much of it you are willing to grease with (and who you are willing to grease). Trumps the GOP's man. Out of all the contenders he has got the plan that gives the best win for their donors and 1%er buddies. The only reason they don't like him is because he is not established in the ways they want (He hasn't got legacy). This means they cannot control him. Legacy isn't just about family history. It is also about how you are established now. All of the GOP have it in the right places. Trump doesn't. The GOP is seriously stupid, though. If their top goal is to regain the White House then they need to be supporting Trump.

&gt;Source?

What? You can't see the inevitable? [Ahh, Well, here is one source.](http://www.futuretimeline.net/) Today, the average auto factory uses 1/5th the workers it did in 1960. Robots do 100% of the heavy lifting and fine work in these factories. Fast Food automation technology only needs to be installed, it has already been perfected. Excepting the final punch work, a house can by built from the ground up using automation. Automation is currently being perfected for industrial construction. 3d printing will be ubiquitous inside of ten years. This little invention alone will eliminate literally thousands of industries as even complex machines become available to the average user at the touch of a button. And you would be surprised at the vast armies of people little industries like toe nail clipper and paperclip producers collectively employ.  5 workers for one job is actually a conservative estimate. I believe the real estimate is closer to 9 workers for every job that exists (for an 88% unemployment rate).


Welcome to the future.

&gt;This is a bad thing? Domestic consumers have access to a cornucopia of goods at prices that were once unimaginable.

Except that is not true. Auto prices haven't dramatically dropped in the last two years at all. Neither have steel tools or consumer goods for that matter. Now if you are looking to buy a warship or a skyscraper your costs likely went down a bit, but there has been no end consumer benefit to the steel price fall. In fact just the opposite. See, a large part of my business was once middle manning steel, whether pure or scrap. I could pull in a near thousand a month using relatively little labor just shuttling scrap around town and selling it to various scrapyards and dye shops. This had both the benefit of keeping people employed (there were at least 20 local outfits doing the same thing as I, some on a much bigger scale), and keeping scrap off of the streets and out of landfills. Today, I'm out of the steel business (that is 12 grand a year out of my pocket). All my scrappers are out of business, too. That's a good 500 jobs lost, and many of them had families to support. A lot of the local dye shops are gone (another couple hundred jobs lost). Landfills are booming, though. They are now getting tons of perfectly good steel to plant into the ground so it can do absolutely nothing at all (as opposed to being recycled into something useful). You know that old car battery? Just toss it. Drop it in the trash. Doing that will save you money as opposed to taking it in and recycling it. This is just locally. One Town. Now multiply this across every city and state in the country. Tell me again how this is good for the economy? Detroit is a ghost city because of shenanigans like this pulling industry away. Both Pittsburgh and Philly have been reduced to poverty stricken shit holes because of it.

Good for the economy, my ass. What I wrote above is the legacy of unrestricted free trade. It kills the economy, one business at a time. ",1

"&gt; All you have done is dodge the question and go off on tangents that had nothing to do with my query.

First off, I answered your question twice. At first with a ""no"" since I didn't care to find one, and then again with a ""yes"" when I realized that the US is a country that didn't have minimum wage for a majority of its history.

Second, your question was irrelevant to the post that I made, hence why I dismissed it. It is at best an appeal to popularity.

&gt; I am pretty sure you would be correct that statism runs country to principles of libertarianism. The problem is you don't give any examples of this ""Statism"" country and nor do you have an example libertarian nation. I have no idea what this ""Statism"" nation is. Is it the US or China, or even both.?

Any state is ran according to the principles of statism, so that would be all states.

&gt; What governments are you talking about?

All of them.

&gt; Considering there isn't any libertarian style governments how do you know a libertarian wouldn't be just a violent as any present day governments?

Have we not been here already? I thought we've been here. I'm advocating for statelessness. If you're advocating for a state, then [the burden of proof is on you to answer for the violence of the state](https://mises.org/library/wouldnt-warlords-take-over). Namely you'd have to answer for violence directly attributable to the state itself. Although we cannot say that a libertarian society would be nonviolent, basic reason leads us to understand that the institutionalization of violence leads to more violence, not less.

&gt; What does this even mean?

It means that ideas are implemented not based upon reason but upon popularity and the whims of rulers. If you have a good idea, you'll never need to initiate force against others in order to implement it. Governments are based upon the initiation of force. It's *the* distinguishing factor between normal people and people calling themselves government.

&gt; Governments or nations depend on citizens participation

Exactly, like I said, it's an appeal to popularity, not an appeal to good ideas.

&gt; if we don't vote or attend meetings or get involved in local politics of course our government will passing laws not in our interests but those with more influenced and there is no proof that a libertarian style government will not be more gullible than the one we have now.

Libertarian government is an oxymoron, and this is a false dichotomy. I'm not advocating for a libertarian government but voluntaryism.",1

Whenever the national Democrats decide to run on a platform of gun control, all the purple states vote Red.  People don't want the government touching our guns.

And, as for this list, yes, I went and listened to it to hear for myself, given the source of this article, and yes, she did say all these points.

My 3 main issues is how she brings up one, the ""gun show loophole,"" which doesn't really exist.  I got to several gun shows a year.  I am a Democrat.  I've had to do fill out proper background check forms (NICS) at every single show.  Second, the whole no-fly list should be included in 2nd amendment bans.  I am sorry, but we still don't even know the criteria the government uses other than the ""Trust us, they are suspected terrorists"" as being the reasoning for people ending up on the list.  So, here we have a list that has no oversight, that the government can add anyone they want to, and ultimately restrict their 2nd amendment rights...  That seems just great Hillary. That doesn't have potential for being misused. /s Third, the whole line she gave that she thinks we should be able to sue gun manufactures for gun violence.  Yup, you heard that right, she literally wants to blame the gun companies themselves.  Know what this means?  This is the equivalent of a beating someone with a bat, and that individual being able to sue the bat manufacturer.  Buy ammunition from a supplier in Walmart?  Ya, that person used your ammunition?  Time to sue you!

This is basically saying the Colorado theater shooting massacre, because the guy chose to use one brand of gun over another, means the gun manufacturer should be open to litigation...

Hillary, I am a Democrat living in Arizona.  Democrats love our guns here.  We are a purple state.  I 100% guarantee that Arizona will vote Republican if Hillary keeps on this anti-gun pursuit.",3

"&gt; In one exchange between Clinton and her chief of staff Cheryl Mills in April 2012, Mills forwards an email with the subject line “Photo gone viral!” that includes the now-iconic image of Clinton with dark sunglasses on, looking at her BlackBerry. 

&gt; Clinton responds to Mills with, “Why now? That was on my way to Libya?” Mills then writes back, “You look cute.”

OMG!!! This is it everyone... they have now proven everything; Whitewater, BENHGAZI, emailgate, DNCgate, servergate, donationgate, gategate, the 7th circle of hellgate! ALL of it!!!

&gt; Another back-and-forth, this time between Clinton and top aide Jake Sullivan, has Clinton discussing who deserves credit for using the term “pivot” to Asia.

&gt; Sullivan forwards an article in May 2012 that included the line “Ever since President Obama announced a 'pivot' to Asia and Secretary Clinton declared this to be 'America's Pacific Century' Washington's Asia policy has been firing on all cylinders.” 

&gt; While Sullivan proclaims the article a “terrific piece and well worth the trip to India to produce,” Clinton fixates on the “pivot” line. “Remind—didn’t we, not the WH, first use the ‘pivot’?” Clinton writes to Sullivan. He responds, “Yes, but happy to give it to them at this point. Can discuss.”

Another key piece of DAMNING evidence right here... this will surely help make the case for corruption and selling secret classified information to India!

&gt; Two other emails highlight the extent to which Clinton as secretary of state continued her involvement with the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation — at least from a distance. A Sept. 15, 2011 email shows State sent 10 of Clinton’s senior staffers to the 2011 annual CGI event, where world leaders and CEOs mingle to discuss global problems while also striking business deals. 

10 whole staffers!!! From a distance!!! Clinton black ops snipers right there, all trained as deadly agents of destruction.

&gt; In another Jan. 17, 2013 email, Clinton asks her assistant to print out recommendations on CGI and Clinton Foundation leadership, sent from her friend Jan Piercy, executive vice president of ShoreBank International. “Regarding the Clinton Foundation leadership: I feel -- as do MANY -- passionate and impatient to see leadership that could unite CGI and the Foundation in more strategic, thoughtful engagement of both philanthropic contribution and investment resources,” she writes. “So, who?” Her suggestions are redacted.

Having a greater impact in philanthropic contribution's!!! That she devil!!!

In all seriousness;

&gt; The agency released roughly 5,500 more pages of emails from the private email account that Clinton exclusively used during her four years at Foggy Bottom, with an additional 275 messages now upgraded to classified, bringing the **total number of retroactively classified emails that moved through Clinton’s unsecured server to 1,274.**

This isn't new stuff here folks. This is her personal emails, normal everyday stuff. r/conspiracy can bite my shinny metal a**.

On a side note (OSN) - EMAILGATE is back baby! Let's do this thing.

"&gt; Wages and productivity are unrelated.

Only if we make it that way.  Economists can follow productivity gains, and politicians can then raise the minimum wage accordingly, and that is a completely sustainable system.    

&gt; The workers aren't more productive, the tools they use are.

And the investors with capital to invest in those tools got the capital through labor of the workers largely trained by the government via public education and publicly funded colleges.  And those investors are protected by the government through publicly funded police, and without said police, those investors would have terrible things happen to them.  And those investors are able to conduct business via a publicly-funded infrastructure, the vast majority of which is paid for by other people than themselves.  

Do you see how the economy is interconnected, and it's not all about the investor?  And that the investor owes more to everyone else than we owe them?  Without the rest of society, the investor is meat for bears.  We can have an economy where investors make a profit, and everyone else makes a rise in their standard of living.  *That's the whole point of economic research, is to raise society's standard of living*.  

&gt; If minimum wage rose with inflation since its founding it would be $4.20 today.

In other words, if we wanted people in poverty even further than today, and take up more welfare costs, we'd go with that.  I don't think that plan is intelligent.

To be honest, I do not respect your opinion at all, because you want to keep people in poverty.  I just explained why said poverty is avoidable, and is sustainable to avoid.  ",1

I listen to a lot of NPR and shows like Dianne Reame and political analyst (for whatever their opinion is worth) and it's a pretty common opinion. Can't really cite that for you. The biggest question though, is why would you need an analyst to tell you that? Is it really that hard to imagine that if presented with two choices, one they have heard of and one they haven't, the person will pick the name they recognize? And is it also that hard to understand that a debate aired on national tv is a good opportunity for someone that doesn't have the last name Bush or Clinton to get their name in the minds of voters? 

You are proof that what I think would be common sense isn't so common and writing this got me curious so I did a very basic Google search and the first thing I found was a Princeton study that looked to find how important name recognition was in voting and how effective debates were at improving name recognition. Imagine that! 

Their conclusion was that in the absence of information voters pick the name they recognize and that debates do help develop name recognition. Again, this seems like common sense and a pointless study to me, but you are evidence that I have no idea what common sense is.

-Universal healthcare including implementation of his new tax plan which will increase taxes on the very wealthy

-Cutting defense spending

-Ending farm subsidies

-Tougher gun laws and universal background checks

-More accountability for police officers (saw this one today)

-Expanding social security

-Wants to break up the for-profit prisons system

-Advance LGBT rights in America

-Campaign finance reform

-Setting a federal minimum wage of $15

What president in history achieved even just a part of that list (especially those big hitters)? Gay rights are a huge topic and we have come pretty far in the past few years with Obama. There is plenty left to go.

But what ranks as most important on that list? What will Bernie focus on? How long will that initiative take?

Her career in the private sector and her venerable charity, as well as her time as FLOTUS, as senator representing New York, and as Secretary of State under President Obama has given her an impressive and varied resume that is unmatched.

As a minority I am also impressed by her history of civil rights and women's rights, backed up by the endorsements of prominent civil rights legends like Rep.

She acknowledges her past mistakes on LGTBQ rights and will be an advocate moving forward as we look to protect the hard won gains we have made as a country.

It's important to remember that it was the Clintons who rolled out NAFTA back in the 90s: their campaigns were funded by the 1% corporate class who were interested in expanding their pool of labor available far beyond the boarders of the United States.  These policies have driven down the barging power of the average middle class American who needs to sell his or her skills and time for an income.  It's a basic ""Porters 5 Forces"" business strategy - executive management can run a more successful business if they diminish the power of their suppliers &amp; the average American middle class person is a supplier of his/her skills and labor to their corporate employers.

Trump and Sanders both get this and both of them have a different approach to addressing the economic pain points resulting from the reduced bargaining power of the American middle class worker.",3

1 - So far,  they're just trespassing and generally making themselves out to be a bunch of stooges for public land privatization (a political movement adored by big cattle, big timber, would be water monopolists, and big mineral mining companies).  

2 - calling people that even a small percentage of Americans identify with ""terrorists"" will reduce the villanizing effect of the term,  undermining the military industrial complex's justification for sweet endless profitable war. (if it's just 10 percent,  that's still ~~60~~ 30 million)  

3 -  they aren't really terrorists,  they're rebels. To be terrorists they need to commit an unlawful act of war against a civilian population (or by the more contemporary definition an act of war not recognized as lawful by whoever is calling them terrorists). So far, they are occupying an unoccupied government building in protest, in direct violation of (a few minor) laws of their country. ...not exactly 9/11.   As of now there is no indication that they intend to commit any terroristic act, they have made no material threats, and they have not brandished their arms. 

Let's hope they don't *become* terrorist rebels. 


4 -  it might be better not to shoot a bunch of idiots who haven't really done anything that bad yet,  except getting way out of line with their relatively peaceful demonstration..... Unless we're just going to start shooting people for minor infractions just to make an example of them. 

5 -  if we just bombed them,  it would create hundreds or even thousands of actual domestic terrorists overnight..... The vanilla ISIS scenario. ",-1

Yah they said the same thing about McCain and Romney.  Didn't work. 

The biggest reason that Trump won't win is that no Republican can win.  The Democrats have such a huge advantage in the big population states (New York, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc.) that when you give all of the blue states to the Democrats and all of the red states to the Republicans, Republicans end up with around 205 electoral votes and the Democrats end up with around 250.  This makes it a lot easier for the Democrat to put together a winning map.  Republicans need to win all of the swing states.  Democrats can win without Ohio.  Democrats can win without Florida.  It would be very tough, but Democrats could win without both of them.  

The biggest reason McCain and Romney couldn't win has nothing to do with their elections specifically.  They just weren't extraordinary enough to overcome the math.  Trump is more dynamic than those guys, but his disapproval ratings are so absurdly high, especially among the Hispanic vote the Republicans need to win 40% of to win the election, that he won't be able to overcome the math either.

"I've always thought it was ridiculous to tie healthcare to employment and require that it be an employee benefit. Most people know how it started, that during World War II we had wage controls on how much an employee's salary could be, so employers started offering health insurance as an added benefit because it circumvented these rules. Years later, the IRS created a tax rule that didn't count health benefits toward income and it's created strange incentives to stick with a system that works against both employers and their employees. 

From this policy paper:

&gt;Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that
comes with finally separating health insurance from employment. That freedom
would not only help the American people live happier, healthier and more fulfilling
lives, but it would also promote innovation and entrepreneurship in every sector of
the economy. People would be able to start new businesses, stay home with their
children or leave jobs they don’t like knowing that they would still have health care
coverage for themselves and their families. Employers could be free to focus on
running their business rather than spending countless hours figuring out how to
provide health insurance to their employees.

Looking at the math in his proposal, a worker making $50,000 a year will not only save ~$5600 a year on average but his employer will save $9500. Not to mention it provides healthcare to over 20 million Americans who have no coverage while removing copays and deductibles. This is really going to ~~change~~ save people's lives.",121

"For those who want to know what the betting odds are for the presidential candidates, as of today 1/27/16, here are the current odds. 

This is from a legal betting site called Bovada.  You can look at the odds without betting.

The way it works is a negative means the person is favored a positive means that they are not.
Right now the book on the Democratic Iowa primary is:
 Clinton -225 Sanders +150. 
That means you need to put up $225 to win $100 for Clinton (favored). If you put up $100 and Sanders wins, you get $150. 

The book on the New Hampshire Democratic primary is:
Sanders -400 Clinton +300
This means that you have to put up $400 for Sanders to win $100 (favored). If you put up $100 for Clinton, and she wins, you win $300. 
I have looked at the betting sites in past elections, and they are pretty good predictors of viability.

"Both Roberts and Stiglitz comments came before the full text of TPP was released, additionally you have to keep in mind that stuff like the ISDS provisions in particular enter more the realm of business and trade law than pure economics. 

What this means is that while for an economist the whole ISDS thing might seem suspect, for an international trade lawyer the ISDS clause is yawn inducing because it's nothing new, and we've had it since the 60's. Interestingly enough, the ISDS clause in TPP is a thing of its own, as it makes it harder to be abused by a litigating party than ever before and forces several conciliatory procedures before any such litigation can be introduced.

They do make an interesting case on how the harmonization of regulation across the parties is being done. What we're seeing is that the ""American way"" of regulation is being extended to other countries, and such is the case with TPP specially when it deals with Intellectual Property... this is a core issue in the current negotiations for TTIP, since unlike any other trade deal before, the europeans standards are seen on an equal leverage as the US standards in the regulation of certain legal constructs, therefor what comes out of it should be quite interesting.   

So ultimately, even if they hadn't seen the actual text of the treaty and they're not entirely correct (or perhaps overtly alarming) regarding the ISDS clause, they do bring valid points that should be discussed, such as the international standardization of the ""American way"". However, as you can imagine, since what that means is that US-like law is being extended to other countries, it also means that current US law won't change much from what you already have.",1

I'm sorry but have you seen the frontpage of /r/politics recently? It's literally all pro Bernie or anti Hillary.

Why are you sorry? The front page of /r/politics is definitely slanted heavily towards Bernie as he's generated a lot of enthusiasm here, which I don't mind in theory as long as the posts are productive (which definitely isn't always the case as a lot of junk or reposts get kneejerk upvoted) or, as you stated, the anti-Hillary posts which, unfortunately, get lots of upvotes since they tend to appeal to Bernie fans AND Republicans. Even though I'm not a fan of Hillary, there is definitely a lot of chaff that could be culled there (bad post-wise).

"&gt; When you subsidize tuition, the market gets to keep raising the prices because there is no loss in demand for ridiculously high prices, government just keeps forking up the difference and the institution gets to keep raising the price.

Actually, if we look back at the tuition and subsidization of college [over the last 25 years](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jarmstrong#!/vizhome/SHEFInteractiveStateData/WaveCharts), what we see among public schools of higher education is that the average cost per FTE student cyclically rises and falls and only slowly increasing over time (11.5% over the last 25 years with respect to inflation). The greater trend we see is that the students' share of the cost per FTE has gone up over time by 110% largely due to subsidization having fallen by 25% per FTE. Less subsidization per FTE student means students pick up the slack.

&amp;nbsp;


That said, there's things that the College for All Act does to reduce the unnecessary portions of rising tuition rates by preventing Federal and State matching funds from being used for administrator salaries and non-academic buildings such as stadiums and student centers which is where a lot of increased tuition funds are going.

"Polls aren't correct. And anything anyone says (including us) is just educated guessing based on experiences.

Here's my feeling on the matter. I am an independent that has mostly voted Republican for President. I am supporting Bernie this election and have registered as a Democrat just so I can vote for him in the primary. This will be my first ever primary vote. I absolutely will not vote for Hillary. Unless she is running against Trump. Hillary is the lesser evil in this case. Any other Republican candidate gets my vote over Hillary.

So when I see polls like that (and it's pretty consistent across all polls) it feels to me like it is accurate. I admit that my own bias is playing into this but I also base this off of personal experience. HRC is a very polarizing person. The hardcore democrats will vote for whoever they nominate but she is viewed very poorly outside of that.

As far as Dean and Gowdy, all I've ever heard was an email address.  It's unclear what information was conveyed, I'd imagine Dean is probably not bound by national security agreements in that regard, Gowdy may well be, which would be hilarious.  

Operating a server and routinely handling emails (how many 60,000+ in her tenure, is routine) when possibly being allowed some latitude for occasional use is a different matter.  Aside from highly questionable security practices, there was SCIF level data handled which should never have been transacted at all.   When she's running at over 1000 classified documents, it's very serious, especially given the probable ease of compromise.

At best, it shows secretive tendencies, a tendency to think she's above and beyond rules that apply to other people, and exceptionally poor judgement.    At worst, it's highly criminal.  It could get very awkward very fast if she's facing 500+ counts of mishandling classified data, which she may well be.

Yeah, we don't think it was fraud because it doesn't meet the definition of ""fraud.""

&gt; If I trick my younger brothers into signing over all of their savings to me, it might not be illegal, but that doesn't mean it's not WRONG.

No, that's *definitely* fraud. You both *misrepresented* and *benefitted.* You defrauded your brothers because you lied to them for personal, unfair gain.

But here's the thing. Fraud is *both* of those. If one person did one, and another unrelated person did another, that's *not* fraud. Nobody's guilty of a crime or even unethical behavior. If your parents say ""look, you've got to get a college degree if you want to have a comfortable and successful life"" because they genuinely believe that, and that prompts you (and everyone else) to sign your life over to student loans and a college education, which *doesn't* actually lead to a successful life, *nobody has defrauded you.* The people who benefitted didn't lie to you, and the people who lied to you didn't benefit.

So if one person (or indeed, everyone) tells you ""housing prices can't help but rise"" and *another* person offers you ""hey, here's a way you can invest in home mortgages, which is a good idea because they're backed (""collateralized"") by a valuable asset, but all the risks of investment in property still apply, so be aware"" and you combine the two and decide ""hey, this is a low-risk, high-yield investment! I can't lose!"" then *nobody defrauded you.* You were at worst an idiot of some kind, and at best just extremely unlucky. And if you invested *someone else's* money (like, all of the pensions of the people who used to work for you) then *they* were just extremely unlucky, because you had done exactly what you had been hired to do, violated no fiduciary duty because your actions were in good faith, and they'll just have to deal with the loss of their pensions because investment is inherently risky, not a guaranteed path to wealth like a bunch of people who didn't really think about it said it was.",2

"No. Not at all. You're taking the typical Sanders supporter point of view that single payer automatically works no matter what the plan is, because of plans that work in other countries. You're creating a strawman that totally mischaracterizes all of the actual criticism people are making, even the criticisms that Clinton is making. The Sanders view totally ignores the fact that ""single payer"" is not some kind of monolithic plan and that all single payer countries are not one identical system.

If Bernie plan was one sentence: ""My plan would phase in a system like the NHS in the UK"", I would totally support it. If it included details about how it would be phased in over time without totally destroying healthcare in the interim, I would be absolutely ecstatic. I am a middle-class guy with good insurance, but I don't mind the taxes if it means helping other people. A single payer system could totally work in America, but it needs to be an actual, reasonable plan. It needs to be a well-researched plan based off of actual numbers, preferably even taking a pessimistic view to ensure it will survive even bad-case scenarios.

Bernie's plan doesn't do anything of the sort. It makes some vague statements and then relies on numbers that are either fabricated or misinterpreted. More people than just ""respected politicians like Clinton"" oppose it. For example, Krugman, an actual economist who's been pushing single payer for years, has criticized it. Ezra Klein, a progressive Vox columnist whose focus has been the intersection of politics with the economy in general and healthcare in particular, wrote an absolutely scathing column pointing out all of the many flaws in Sanders' plan--none of which were ""it'll raise taxes"" (he does bring up taxes but then immediately follows by pointing out that those taxes replace current healthcare premiums).",2

"Waste water disposal is something the oil industry needs to do in many places it operates whether or not there is fracking.

However, fracking makes some areas profitable for the oil industry to operate (or did before the huge price drop) that would not be profitable without fracking.

So it indirectly brings the oil industry, and all the oil industry associated wastewater disposal, to those areas.

Most of the wastewater is stuff being produced out of the oil reservoir: it was either there to begin with, or was placed there intentionally as an enhanced oil recovery tactic to heat or pressurize the formation, so that the oil would flow.

Where I work, the water coming back up with oil is separated from the oil at facilities called ""dehys"" (dehydration units), then filtered and softened.

Some of it is then disposed of in disposal wells (often strategically placed to prevent subsidence from occurring as fluid is removed from the reservoir) and the rest used in steam generators or pressurized for water injection to help get more oil out of the reservoir.

"&gt; The difference being they didn't buy their way to having that platform. 

How does that matter? Seems like an arbitrary requirement.

&gt;That doesn't really line up. We're talking about a restriction - this example would require the existence of a positive right to the internet. This doesn't exist yet. 

Not true. You could outlaw the internet, or limit everyone to a certain amount of data. That'd be nearly identical to what many ""Campaign Finance Reform"" advocates want, yet when you apply it to another aspect of free speech, it's obviously ridiculous.

&gt;Not correct. Rights are not absolute and the court has read both exclusions and restrictions from the right to free speech.

Rights are absolute. That's one of the very basic characteristics of rights and many, if not all of those restrictions should be considered unconstitutional.

&gt;In my jurisdiction, which isn't the US, if there is a reason that can be justified in a democratic society to limit a right, the right can be limited. As I see it an even and open playing field when it comes to political speech is a pressing public need. The right to monopolize airwaves and donate to political campaigns should be restricted for this reason. 

I love when people who aren't from America try to lecture me on American law an politics. Unlike many other countries, likely including whatever one you're from, we place a certain reverence on freedom of speech, and one of the most important parts of that is protecting freedom of speech even when it makes your political positions harder to pass.

&gt;Again, this doesn't add up. This would require a positive right to have arms, not negative right of no restriction on arms. 

Or restrict anyone from having more than one gun, which again, is similar to what so many ""Campaign Finance Reform"" advocates want for money.

&gt;My point, one which you glossed over entirely, is that freedom of speech is underpinned by the marketplace of ideas. Normatively the quality of an idea would determine if it ""won"" - in a completely unregulated environment with no campaign spending limits it comes down to the amount of money someone has that propels their ideas to the top. This is repugnant, in my view, to ""free speech"" as a concept. 

You can spend all the money in the world campaigning for a cause or candidate, but if the people don't agree, they won't vote for it. This is true without your restrictions on free speech.

&gt;Hence - on the Supreme Court's reading - some people just have more speech than others. 

But not more of a right to free speech than others, which is an important distinction.

It was made shit by the actions of the Governor's appointed Emergency Manager (there was actually a series of them) when they 1) declined Detroit's offer to extend their contract at roughly half the current cost which would have represented more savings than switching to an as yet incomplete source (which project is run by cronies of the Gov.) in spite of claims about making the switch to save money 2) did not fulfill the requirements of EPA by a) adding the required conditioner to the water because it was known to be corrosive to the aged pipe system b) not testing as required by EPA c) lying about the test results d) hiding the known problem from regulators and the public e) lying to the public that there was a problem (the Snyder admin. hooked up GM to the old source at a cost of $400,000 when GM told them the water was corroding parts on the assembly line; the state government office building in Flint was fitted with water coolers to replace the drinking fountains 8 or 9 onths before Snyder admitted there was a problem) 3) there's more, a lot more    

&gt;It's not the governor's fault that the Flint city council decided to quit getting water from Detroit before their hookup to their new source was complete,

That's not what happened. 1) The decision to _not renew the contract with Detroit_ was made by the Snyder appointed Emergency Manager, despite Detroit's offer to basically halve the price which would have saved far more than switching. 2) The decision was made knowing full well that the ultimate intended water source (a project run by Snyder cronies) would not be ready for several years. IOW, the switch was necessitated by the refusal of Detroit's offer to make accommodations AND the decision to source water from a barely in-progess source.    

&gt;It's not the governor's fault the city council didn't fully consider the effects of the Flint River water on their water infrastructure.

The city council did not make the decision, it was made by the Governor's appointed Emergency Manager. They didn't do what they are required by law and EPA regulation to do in order to ensure the safety of the water. 


So no, you don't have a clue as to what actually happened.  You clearly have not bothered to seek any actual information, as in __facts__, about the situation in order to determine where the fault lies.  Noooo, you make counterfactual statements because LIBS BAD or something. 

If you want anyone to pay attention to your political views, if you would like anyone to give your opinion the least credit, then you should stop whining and making shit up. Otherwise  you make yourself out for an idiot, a fool.

The governor doesn't own the Flint water works, the people do. All of these have democratic control over them as well. Obama and on down the chain of command take care of our military. It is pretty key that our commander in chief is elected. Of course, Flint water works was no longer a socialist component once the EM took control. How did that removal of socialism work out?

"I would say fracking is a contributor to the wastewater that is disposed in disposal wells, but I would not say it is the main contributor. Some normal production wells can produce thousands of barrels of water a month. A frac job normally takes 2k-10k barrels (Numbers I got online, but they seem to agree with what I remember from college) However, you don't see all that water return via flowback... and the fracjob is a generally a one-time operation...

A normal lifespan assumption for a well is 30 years. So if a well produces 1,000 barrels a month for 30 years, that's 360,000 barrels of water over the life of a well. All the water isn't always disposed of via injection, but it is safe to say that normal production is a greater cause of the wastewater production than fracking. 

As I said, more water is produced toward the tail end of the life of these wells though, so we're seeing a lot of wastewater being produced from oil wells (once prolific oil wells, now just marginal) that were drilled in the 70's and 80's

There are various people / companies that are looking at solving the wastewater issue, but it's not at the forefront of popular concern because people keep bringing up fracking (like it's the evil) when really the issue is simply wastewater production and disposal which is basically just a byproduct of O&amp;G. 

I'm obviously a member of the O&amp;G industry, but I do support the advancement of clean energy simply because I know the negative aspects of the oil and gas are substantial. For now, oil and gas is a necessary evil to keep the world running... but hopefully someday, not too long from now that is not the case.  ",7

&gt;every American would be automatically enrolled into Medicare. This is commonly referred to as “Medicare for All.” Like the systems in many other industrialized countries, private practitioners could still provide care, but everyone would be covered by a national health care plan. This allows for private delivery and public financing to insure guaranteed health care for all and effective cost control.

You increase the labor on their end as well attempting to learn the law. Just like the constitution is a simple framework, laws should be too, then government organizations define policies and procedures on how to adhere to the laws and distribute and enforce. The courts are there to assist with interpretation and precedence and constitutionality when needed. 

Think about it also from a standpoint of collaboration and ability to react to change. If Congress passes a law ""In order to X you must Y"" and the executive branch comes up with a procedure for how businesses would do ""Y"", and then businesses start to implement that procedure and find out it's hard or costly, or they find an easier way, they could provide that feedback quickly and the government could provide updated procedures that benefit more people, or take into account certain exceptions, or clarify meaning... versus it having to go all the way back through the legal system and go no where because it's too costly to change under the current process.

""Sanders's plan is 'not a serious proposal, and it lacked the detail that large-scale health care overhauls require, leaving open numerous questions about feasibility,' says John Hudak, a fellow in government studies at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, in Washington, D.C. Among the issues the plan fails to address is a contingency for doctors, hospitals, and private health insurers who might exit the market in reaction to potentially lower pricing set by the government. As a result, the plan interjects only a note of uncertainty for business owners who are just coming to terms with the ACA, Hudak says.""

Paul Krugman: “Put it this way: for all the talk about being honest and upfront, even Sanders ended up delivering mostly smoke and mirrors — or as Ezra Klein says, puppies and rainbows. Despite imposing large middle-class taxes, his ‘gesture toward a future plan’, as Ezra puts it, relies on the assumption of huge cost savings.

Boston Globe’s Michael Cohen: “I find it increasingly difficult to take Sanders seriously as a presidential candidate… Maybe it’s that he gets away with proposing unrealistic policy ideas that have little chance of being passed even by Democrats in Congress, let alone Republicans, and then gets praised for being authentic. Sunday night Sanders finally released his single-payer health care plan, which is all of eight pages and provides little detail on how he’ll implement a complete restructuring of the US health care system. That’s at least an improvement over his plan for breaking up the banks, which is four pages and just as short on detail. Maybe it’s that every time he answers a question on foreign policy and national security, it’s blindingly apparent that not only does he not understand foreign policy and national security, he simply doesn’t care to know more… Sanders really does have a singularly naive and simple-minded understanding of American politics.” 

&gt;""Republicans would much rather run against Bernie Sanders and have a chance to define him from the get-go as extreme and out of touch,"" Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a Mitt Romney campaign veteran, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

&gt;While polls tell one story, Republican campaigns and operatives tell another: They view Clinton as a much tougher general election opponent than Sanders.

&gt;A story by Yahoo's Hunter Walker was an example of what could come up: Sanders' one-time support for nationalizing industries like oil and electric utilities, the seizure of those industries without compensation and his desire to take the Rockefeller family's wealth and use it to help the poor.

&gt;When CNN asked strategists working with Republican presidential campaigns how they might deploy those details against Sanders in a general election, none would discuss it on the record -- another indication that the party is intent on letting Sanders remain unscathed while his opponent is Clinton.

""My assumption about why Obama's releasing it today:

He wants to get this out to the public so that it can be factored in by voters BEFORE the primaries.

Think about the scenario of Hillary winning the nomination, and then this information coming to light.

- Sanders supporters (myself included, full disclosure) would be FURIOUS that voters were basically denied relevant information that could have swayed the vote before the primaries. It could cause a huge schism in the party, and lose the Democrats the election before the general even starts.

- Republicans use the information in the general election to attack her ruthlessly (I'm sure they already will, but this new information makes her look even worse). It causes the Democrats to lose the presidency and look bad as a party.

On the upside, with the information being released before the primaries, it helps the Obama administration and Democrat party save some face. If Hillary still wins the nomination, she has more of a defense against the inevitable attack ads from Republicans (maybe). Sanders supporters freak out less (maybe) and not as many pull away.

Just my opinion, but I think Obama is starting to fear for the future of the party a little.""",5

Not to the extent they will with Hillary.  Meaning they are less likely to put their necks on the line for him.

&gt;We'll see how the Iowa and New Hampshire votes go. Iowa seems neck and neck and New Hampshire seems like a lock for Sanders. Everything changes among the rank and file after those states cast their votes.

Uh rank and file in this case means the other elected democrats in Congress, not the voters.  And yes the polls are close in those two states.  But like every other Bernie supporter you are leaving out a couple key things.  Bernie's main supporters are young voters, they have the lowest voter turnout out of any age bracket.  Bernie also has poor support among minorities (tho to be fair there ain't much in the way of minorities in those states), and overall poor support among women.  Three things that are going to hurt him come to the primaries.

 - shut down the government for a few weeks  
 - block any further action on economic recovery, e.g. additional spending on infrastructure projects, and plenty of other proposals that were part of Obama's presidential agenda  
 - Have a significant effect at the state level:  sweeping new state anti-abortion laws, union crushing, etc.  Tax cuts for the wealthy, easing of regulation for large corporations, services cut for the poor (bioler plate Republican agenda).  
 - Act as huge barriers to Medicaid expansion in state legislatures, e.g. the Virginia state legislature blocks it in a state that voted comfortably for Obama twice.

I looked up her record after the endorsement. She is still a very strong advocate for LGBT rights. I think why most sanderites are upset by it though are 2 reasons. First is that Bernie has had a consistent score of 100 percent in his years in office while Hillary has had not. Not to say she is against LGBT rights but she plays the political game more rather than voting for her own beliefs. And that's the second problem most Bernie supporters have. The endorsement felt to a lot of us that it was a political move rather than being based on merit. It was a move saying ""We're gonna vote for the one we think is gonna win rather than the one that will fight for us more."" To me this is the most frustrating argument that most of Hillarys supporters have. ""I'm gonna vote for her because she's gonna win."" It's a self fulfilling prophesy. Of course she will win if that's your only reason to vote for her. Not based on her other policies or her record but because ""she will win.""

You can base your argument in semantics if you would like, but challenging the status quo and acting to change it, in this sense, are the same thing. You don't start from a position of concession when attempting to affect change, you start with a goal and work to an amenable compromise if necessary. Obama didn't start out attempting to get Obamacare, he entered office with the intent of getting a single payer universal healthcare system implemented.

Pages blasting ""pro-abortion"" and pro-gay rights moderates in their own party before primaries, and of course all liberals. 

A page listing candidates in local political races, ""suggested candidates"", with big check marks next to their names. 

2) The Bradley Foundation, which set up the model of co-existent (c)(3) and (c)(4) entities. 

The (c)(3) pays most of the expenses, including the salaries and expenses of the same officers in both. The same officers lobby for right wing politicians. 

They donate $hundreds of millions to organizations such as the Koch brothers' and John Birch Society friends' Donors Trust, Americans For Prosperity, and other ""directed trust"" entities.

"His support base is broad enough that he doesn't have control over what they wish to do.

People are genuinely disappointed in this decision because of the fact that they endorsed someone who they had connections to rather than someone who represents the choice of their members and supporters. That's the problem with the Democratic establishment. 



He didn't even call for anyone to reject or attack these organizations. His establishment comments were only referring to why it's not surprising that they endorsed Hillary, that's it. The people who are responsible for the endorsement are just the leadership, not the entire organizations, not its workers, not its members, not the causes they fight for. Unfortunately Hillary spun this in a completely deceptive manner, and now some people are lead to believe he was actually attacking the organization's themselves. ",-1

"But commodity items don't behave the same way as professional services like medical care. If they're selling an easy to grow (relatively speaking) plant, there is only so much they can reasonably charge, they'd need to either lower the price or make up for the value elsewhere.

For example, tobacco, it's super cheap if you buy it loose by the bag, even factoring in the insane tax hikes it's taken (we're talking on the order of maybe $20/lb tops). They literally can't sell the stuff for super high prices unless it's specialty stuff like pipe tobacco. Instead, they roll them into cigarettes, put them in a nice box, and charge you for the convenience tradeoff at many times the price of the materials (i.e. ~8-18 *grams* per ~$6-$8 pack).


Even though I agree that shit will change in ways we probably wouldn't like, there is no way that it would cost as much as medical care to buy industrially produced pot. If there is demand for any particular type of a product, including super cheap stuff, the market will fill that gap for people to throw money at.",2

If you stop, as an individual, paying for health insurance (directly or through an employer) then you have more money in your bank account. 

Now, the new system needs funding somehow. This is done through tax. So a tiny amount is added to your tax bill. A flat amount, a contribution. 

That contribution takes a small amount of that extra money in your bank account to fund the new system. You still have saved money, and you are also contributing to the new system.

Call it a National Insurance contribution. It has a maximum and minimum dependant on wage. So you earn $3000 a week and pay a max contribution of $150.

"Wow, you mean smart people earn more? Shocking.

But disregarding the fact that the IQ test is known to be thoroughly flawed and that this data is two decades old, let me just point out that your own diagram claims that as of 1993, the most intelligent people had a median income of what looks to be about $37,000 per year. Which is just about 3.5 times the median income of the lowest-intelligence people.

So, if we run with your logic that smarter people do better and take that to its extreme (where CEOs and high-earners are the most intelligent and minimum-wage earners are the lowest) you'll see that even as of the 1990s, income disparity between CEOs and average workers is only about 3.5.

Here's an article from 2015 that shows how ridiculously extreme the disparity has become: 

&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ceo-worker-pay-gap_55ddc3c7e4b0a40aa3acd1c9

Notice the following. The CEO-worker disparity for the following companies is as follows:

-Walmart: 1133:1.

-CVS: 1194:1.

-Chipotle: 1521:1.

-Discovery Communications: 1950:1.

That means that in these cases, the CEO earns *more than a thousand times* what the average worker earns--to say nothing of the lowest-paid workers.

That's not right, it's not acceptable, and it's not healthy for the economy.",2

"I'm not a ""gun-control advocate"", I'm a gun safety advocate and gun user. Here is what I think is reasonable regarding your items:

2A folks are not going to accept this system because of its lack of transparency. What happens when the system denies you? Anti gun folks will also not like this for the same reasons; How do we know the system is preventing guns from getting into the ""wrong hands""?

&gt; - National carry reciprocity, or national constitutional carry. 

There shouldn't be an issue with this, but it is also unnecessary beyond a feel-good gesture towards 2A'ers. Plenty of SCOTUS precedent. There will also have to be included with any legislation passed a lengthy discussion of who has the right to deny concealed or open carry, and when they can do so (e.g. defining ""sensitive areas"")

&gt; - A repeal of the federal ban on silencers, short rifles, short shotguns. 

The president's EO will give us the data to show whether these features create safety concerns or not. If anything, 2A folks should be getting behind this with gusto. You want to show that silencers are not more dangerous? Facts.

&gt; - A law to prohibit states from banning certain types of rifles and shotguns called ""assault weapons"". 

This one is just a big ol' flaw in reasoning. You want the Federal government to reinforce states rights to enact carry laws, but then you also want the Federal government to enact laws that restrict states' rights. If a state passes a prohibition on a type of gun (regardless of how stupid you think it is) that is not unconstitutional, then that is their right. ",21

"The Tax is paid by anyone investing in UK based Stocks (or Property).  The only exception is to certain big banks that were able to negotiate a way out of it under the BS excuse that they are required to provide liquidity.   So if you buy Stocks using the Bank of England as an intermediary, you can dodge it.  

About 70% of transactions are currently placed through such intermediaries.   This is an example of bribary and political corruption leading to a Government policy that is essentially a giveaway to the big financial institutions.   

Because of this government preference they charge a slightly higher brokerage fee.

As far as I have heard, Bernie Sanders doesn't plan to include exceptions for politically powerful megabanks in his plan, so there is a chance that you could see some amount of shifting trading to the London exchange (Though I doubt much would go to Hong Kong).  However, because of their different regulatory rules many of the most toxic of the High Frequency Trading practices aren't allowed.   

By the way the argument that you are making against the financial transaction tax in the US was the same made against the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax in 1986, and the London Exchange is bigger than ever right now.  Stability is much more important than taxes when it comes to exchanges.  That is why a return to the rule of law in America would be such a boon for investments into American companies.",1

"Sanders claims to be against big corporations — and he may well be sincere about it — but the problem is his proposed solutions could only increase the unjust influence of big money interests. This is because he wants to socialize more and more control over the economy in the hands of the state, which concentrates the power and makes it easier to sell that power.

In a true market — the opposite of socialism — companies can only gain economic power by offering goods that individuals value and choose to exchange for. Everybody wins, and wealth increases. This system encourages competition and includes no element of coercion.

The state, on the other hand, replaces these freely made choices with force. It legalizes and systematizes coercion to accomplish some end that is not chosen distributively by individuals or subject to competition, but is chosen by politicians and bureaucrats. Even when these politicians and bureaucrats have the best intentions (which isn't always the case), they simply cannot know how to accurately organize the economy to best reflect people's subjective values and actual demands. All that can be accomplished is some distortion, which is where the practical rub is. These distortions advantage some segments of the economy and disadvantage others, but due to forceful signals and not peaceful ones. We're in the mess we are because of this problem; more of the same poison can't cure it.

Franz Oppenheimer identified that there are two ways to obtain wealth: there's the economic means — the market; free trade; voluntary exchange — and the political means — coercion and force. If we want a peaceful and prosperous society we must value the economic means to wealth and reject in totality the exploitative political means, which is socialism.

"We'd have to pay to manage that land anyway. If nothing else being ungrazed it would become a huge fire hazard that needs tending. I'd bet it would end up being more expensive. Road maintenance is hardly an issue, it's mostly dirt paths. Predator control you can be sure the Ranchers using it will be glad to take care of that for you. 

You also may not realize this, but one big reason it's so cheap is that it's completely undeveloped land with zero support. On private grazing lands you basically drop off your cattle and they take care of them. On the Federal grazing lands all costs for fencing, watering, etc are on you. Someone else made a more detailed reply about this somewhere in this thread. The short version is this isn't Yellowstone. Most of this land is useless for anything else.

Also, this isn't Wal-Mart employees getting food stamps while the big corporation profits. Many of the people who use these lands are small businesses, usually families. Don't let the Bundy doucheness condemn them all.

So, say we stop the cheap grazing land. First of all BLM is not equipped to enforce that at all, they can't be everywhere. So raise the budget for more enforcement, then raise it for far more maintenance because this undeveloped land is useless to ranchers if it's the same price as private land that does most of the work for you. Of course take away the little bit in grazing fees they get now. Government costs all around go up. The rancher's costs go up, and beef prices go up. Who exactly is benefiting here? Nobody. No money is being saved anywhere.

So long as they can keep us doing what they tell us, just by bringing up scare tactics in every single election – and tell me when was the last election where ""the world wasn't going to end"" if the other side won - they will never actually care about getting our vote and will just do whatever their biggest donors ask them to.

"""Surely they initially stopped because they couldn't do the kind of anti-gun research the anti-gun people then in charge wanted to do.""

No they stopped because congress cut their funding. This is a fact. We are debating why they choose not to resume. We can definitively say why they stopped in the first place as their funding was cut. You have a preconceived notion that they are still biased so you view anything they do as a product of that bias. It is, ironically, a biased view to have as you automatically are discounting any options that fall outside of your bias. Your train of logic works as long as you base it on the assumption that a main goal of the CDC is to ban guns. This is a dubious claim at best since the overwhelming majority of what the CDC does is related to diseases. It is completely reasonable to believe that the CDC is reluctant to jeopardize the funding of their main goals (diseases) in order to perform studies on an issue (guns) for which they have in the past received ridiculous amounts of flak.

""The method of the passing of the law is irrelevant. What matters here are the motives of the CDC under the law""

Completely false given the way you are using it. You are using the fact that congress passed a law limiting the funding as a strong indicator of the CDCs bias as the CDC must be biased if congress was able to pass a law cutting its funding as a result of said bias. You are guilty of deception by omission as the significance of the laws passing is significantly diminished when one realizes that it was snuck into a much larger stimulus bill. People may have felt that the stimulus bill as a whole was important to pass regardless of the CDC funding cut stipulation.

When I talk about the study I mean the one that caused all the commotion in the nineties, so I guess the kellerman one. The example given in the article you provided was arguably an example of bias but one could make the case for it not being biased at all depending on their interpretation of the results. Most of the article was about things people said. Good scientists separate their beliefs from their research so to me what they say is not necessarily indicative of what they will do. If the article had focused more on what was wrong with the study itself it would have been a better piece of support for your argument but still would not make up for the assumptions you make. 

I completely read your article by the way. It was less convincing to me than it is to you.

"It's called ""astroturfing.""

Create a fake citizen's group to give the appearance that there is a movement.

These days, with the advent of the internet and mass media, astroturfed groups probably comprise most movements today--either in practice or origin.

That said, Republicans rely on them institutionally more than Democrats. The DNC is a rather fractured party with tons of disparate interests under the same umbrella (environmentalism, campaign finance reform, social justice, gun control, economic regulation, etc. etc.) Left-leaning voters tend to be more autonomous, starting their own movements when they feel misrepresented by the party (example: if you're a Democrat who doesn't like Hillary Clinton, please stand up.) It's much easier for a Democratic candidate to latch on to a pre-existing citizen movement than to start their own.

Republicans' advantage has long been a unified, singular, nigh-canonical party platform. If you don't agree with it 100%, you aren't a Republican (hence: ""R.I.N.O."") This makes it easier--at least in the past--for Republicans to pick candidates and mobilize large conservative voting blocs, but it also means there are less pre-existing social movements for the GOP to latch onto.

Whereas the left, often feeling under-represented by their party, will take matters into their own hands and start their own movements, the right is more or less monopolized by the GOP, ESPECIALLY now that the GOP has co-opted libertarianism (i.e. libertarianism used to be socially liberal and fiscally conservative, as in a libertarian would agree with social justice platforms while simultaneously endorsing capitalism. Now it has shifted to GOP party-line.) There isn't much in the way of autonomy among the right--everything about the right is dictated by the GOP.

Thus, the GOP has to rely on astroturfing to start their own movements. This is the origin of the Tea Party, started by wealthy, discontent GOP elites.

However, as we have all seen, this backfired catastrophically for the GOP once they lost control of their own movement.",10

Furthermore, OP's post is a downright lie. Free healthcare has nothing to do with the EU in many countries. The UK's NHS existed long before the current EU did. Furthermore, there is still massive wealth inequality both within countries and also across the EU in general, and there are extremely high levels of debt (e.g. Scandinavian countries have the highest level of personal debt in the world). Similarly, free education is not a decree by the EU, as evidenced by the fact that the UK has £9000 per year university fees despite it's high taxation. So not only is OP's info inaccurate but a lot of it has nothing to do with the EU either, and many countries in the EU do not have these things.

If the EU was so great then why parties and policies to get out of the EU getting a lot more traction (especially in UK and France for example)?

"&gt; Really well-written piece.

I'm not so sure. This is the conclusion: 

&gt;The truth is Bernie Sanders can win the nomination and has a far better chance to win the Presidency...no matter what Chris Matthews or Mrs. Greenspan or anyone else at MSNBC thinks you should think.

But the article doesn't offer much evidence in favour of that claim. It criticises Clinton but that's not quite the same thing. I admire a lot of Sanders' sentiment, but if you are going to argue he can win you need to address [the polling data that points emphatically in the opposite direction.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-bernie-sanders-surge-real/).

The article rests heavily on the idea that black voters might see Sanders' various positions as reason to vote for him, but it doesn't address the polling data in this issue detailed in the fivethirtyeight link (above):

&gt;There’s just little-to-no sign that Clinton has lost any traction among black voters. The most recent YouGov poll has her up 75 percent to 18 percent among black Democrats. The most recent Morning Consult poll has her ahead 71 percent to 14 percent. The most recent Monmouth poll has her up 71 percent to 21 percent among non-white voters.

They make a good case for why Sanders is more likeable than Clinton, but not a good case for why he'll beat her. At least that's how I see it.

"&gt; OK I'm going to ask about the pandering. What was it exactly?

It was her pulling the sexism card on Bernie after he said we should ""stop shouting"" about guns. 

It was her using 9/11 as a way of side-stepping legitimate questions about her corporate donations. 

It was her calling for a no-fly zone over Syria to sound tough on defense even though that would bring us into direct conflict with Russia. 

It was her ridiculous Latino pander move. 

It was her opposing the TPP after she supported it for years. 

It was her acting like Bernie's single payer health care plan is going to cost most people more money. 

It was her using her time at the Children's Defense Fund as a political point, even though she helped gut welfare, in opposition to everything that group was saying, while First Lady. 

It was her calling herself a progressive when she is in front of one crowd, and calling herself a moderate Democrat when she is in front another. 

It was her getting the DNC to give her as favorable a debate schedule as possible.

It was her (and the DNC, which is obviously supporting her as much as possible) calling out the Sanders campaign for the data breach, even though they had notified the DNC of the problem months before, and had nothing done about it. 

I could probably go on further, but I think this is enough. I wasn't one of those people who hated Hillary. I was pretty ambivalent about her up until this election. But the more I read about her, and the more I saw her lie and pander and cheat, the more she sickened me. I just can't vote for someone as seemingly objectively terrible as her in good conscience.

"&gt;What about all of the economists, the real economists, that by and large disagree with Sanders on things like free trade and the FED and minimum wage.

Being an economist is only credible when one exercises sound judgment.  Most, not all, of the economists you are referring to there have been wrong on national economic/fiscal policy calls over the past 35+ years.  It's why that community's reputation is in the gutter with the nation.

Take Free Trade, for instance.  Effective U.S. national trade policies should result in trade surpluses in the U.S., not large, growing and sustained deficits.  That's been the result of Free Trade and those who dismiss the consequences are fools to do so.  Here's [the objective evidence of that economic policy failure](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/balance-of-trade)   (click on max for the sordid history ushered in by the largely supply side-centric economists you're confusing for competent economists).

To those who argue the business community can't afford meaningful wage increases, it's bullshit since [we know it's more than possible](http://www.epi.org/publication/understanding-the-historic-divergence-between-productivity-and-a-typical-workers-pay-why-it-matters-and-why-its-real/).  Those supply side-centric economists are ignoring the fact that short-term job losses are more than mitigated by the job creation and higher consumer demand that results from widespread income growth.  If those economists are genuinely concerned about U.S. job losses (which I don't buy), where the Hell was that concern when Free Trade destroyed MILLIONS of U.S. jobs and decimated countless U.S. communities in the process.  Hypocrisy doesn't begin to cover the two-faced arguments we're witnessing over their economic ""concerns"".

You think the Fed has a clue about effective monetary policy or how to oversee the financial industry?  Seriously?  As tragic jokes go, it doesn't get worse than that.  I take it you are blithely unaware of the liquidity concerns and income/wealth disparity that resulted from overinflating capital markets and the ramifications that will result when it blows...and it will.

The majority of the economic community has lost itself in a theoretical echo chamber.  That's not just my view, but that of one of the more credible and competent economists around...[Paul Volcker](http://economicsociology.org/2015/04/18/paul-volcker-the-%E2%80%AA%E2%80%8Eeconomics%E2%80%AC-profession-is-in-trouble-we-need-to-pull-economics-back-into-the-real-world-of-political-economy/).

Neocons spared no expense at vying for this war even in 2001 and at lying to get it and forcing the hand of the Senate.

"Again, I can't overemphasize that the focus on the POTUS is putting the cart before the horse here. *Congress has to pass these bills first*. Full stop. The question is how we get them to do that.

And yes, I think HRC, Obama or any other Dem would sign these bills if they came across the desk in the Oval Office, if even out of self-interest. All of these proposals would benefit the party in elections.

Consider:

- Protecting voting rights, ensuring access, automatic registration and an election day holiday will all bolster turnout. Turnout models show that Dems benefit from increased turnout. The GOP benefits from low turnout, hence their continuous efforts at disenfranchising and suppressing voters.

- Reforming the districting process to eliminate gerrymandering also benefits the Dems, who have gotten schlonged, to borrow a phrase, at the district level after the GOP swept statehouses in 2010. Multi-member districts and ranked voting might be a bit too ""radical"" yet, but I think these reforms would benefit the Dems as well.

- Campaign finance reform is also likely to benefit the Dems, particularly Lessig's proposed voucher system. I can't imagine the GOP would ever allow it, but I don't see why a Dem wouldn't sign it.

Those are, in a nutshell, Lessig's proposals. They would all tend to help Dems win elections. We don't have a problem in the White House here. It's all about figuring out how in the hell to get these bills through Congress.

I do truly admire Lessig's continued efforts here, however flawed. This is a *really* tough problem. It's simply not in the interest of Congress to pass these bills. I can't even imagine the GOP putting these on the floor for a clean vote. To that end, the Congressional ballot is far more important than the race for the big chair.",1

Because I think it's fair to say Mexico doesn't have two billion to spare - and as I mentioned, our foreign aid isn't used for anything vital there and won't move the needle. Or will they just build it on their side using cheap Mexican labor and lax building laws?

If we are to pay it with these penalties, the proposed visa fees, etc aren't going to cover it - chasing down small, illegal remittance payments sounds more costly than profitable - but I'd like to see some details on the proposed tariffs, etc., and I'd love to see him trying to get a Republican congress to impose them.

I think the wall/fence is more symbolic than realistic; there's no way Mexico would ever have the cash to pay for it, they can't even get a decent water system going nation-wide (edit: unless they sold off some of their extensive natural resources, I'd like to see him propose that.) But if we raised penalties on people employing illegals, along with a national card check and the increased 'paper raids' Obama has been doing, then we'd all be forced to confront how we all benefit from illegal immigration (in the form of cheaper produce, restaurants), be able to pay to upgrade our surveillance infrastructure, and raise wages while increasing American employment and stimulating a lot of self-deportation, as happened to the tune of one million immigrants leaving during the recession.

"There is a game politicians play during elections. When running the primaries, you go towards your base to energize them and get the nomination (for republicans that means going to the right). Then during the actual elections, you go back towards the center and hope to win the moderates.

If they don't go far enough, they might not get nominated at all.

Trump went way too far, and even though that makes it easier for him to get the republican nomination, it also makes him too extreme for most of the moderates who would rather vote for a safe option like Hillary.

"&gt; He just talked about how she avoids questions over her motives. Do you have any direct answers to questions like that? 

She talks about her motives non stop...

&gt; Even on the issues, she varies so incredibly much from her from 2008.

Minus a few things that changed among the whole Democratic Party, she been absolutely consistent... 

&gt; She voices whatever is popular, she is not consistent. 

She evolves on certain positions after citizens voice their concern... she picks her battles.

&gt; From her stance on gays, on gun rights, her vote on Iraq war, on immigrants and licenses, to even the Pacific trade deal.

Stance on gays - whole Democratic Party shifted. Again she picks her battles and this is an issue that disqualified you from the presidency in the past. 

Gun rights - she's been pretty consistent on this...

Iraq war - huh being pulled into a war on false premises is something she should have known ahead of time... No one criticized Bernies support for invading Kosovo because the invasion wasn't sold on lies and wasn't prolonged. But because Clinton supported an invasion that a president lied about and blundered she's somehow to blame... 

Immigration - consistent on this issue...

Trade deals - you don't like that she came out against it once more information was released? You would have preferred her to be the one that screams out about the atrocities of a deal she knows nothing about???

&gt; You identified it exactly, she couldn't run on her old views, so, they changed. How magical.

So now she's being criticized for being a candidate in multiple elections... lol how dare she have different policies as Americas perceptions change over 8 years...

&gt; You want to know why they wouldn't release the content of her paid speeches to these groups?

Yes it is, because the way they are describing the world and the country just has little or no basis in reality. The American people are able to notice themselves how things really are.

If they don't win the presidential election that means they lose the presidential election. I said nothing about the Congress or Senate house. 

&gt; Fear absolutely works. 

True, but there needs to be some truth for it to work. If there are some big crises then they will take advantage, and will do their best to use the fear. However, if they don't have something truthful to fall back on it doesn't work

&gt; They're afraid, or at least concerned for the future.

Don't disagree with this, but it is difficult to be afraid of things that are not real and that is how the republicans work. 

&gt; Again, do not underestimate fear.

I haven't done that! Just wrote that basing your campaigns and oppositional policy on only fear mongering is a losing tactic. 

&gt; Because if you do, you'll suddenly find yourself watching Republicans running the country and wondering what happened.

I hope this doesn't happen, that is why it is important to counter the way republican make up things with facts that showes how wrong they are.

"&gt; That's caused because of our voting system of winner takes all. We need mixed member proportional voting

No it's not.  Dems DO have proportional voting.

Under the current Democratic Party selection rules, adopted in 2006, delegates are selected under proportional representation, which requires a candidate have a minimum of 15% of a state's popular vote to receive delegates. In addition, the Democratic Party may reject any candidate under their bylaws. Each state publishes a Delegate Selection Plan that notes the mechanics of calculating the number of delegates per congressional district, and how votes are transferred from local conventions to the state and national convention.[3] Since the 2012 Democratic primaries, the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. is based on two main factors: (1) the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections, and (2) the number of electoral votes each state has in the United States Electoral College. States who schedule their primary or caucus later in the primary season may also get additional bonus delegates.[4]",1

No matter which party you align yourself with these are the two people in this race that are truly running on their own beliefs without influence from their parties or corporate America. In every presidential election since I have been old enough to vote starting in 1991 there has never been significant differences between the Republican and Democrat nominees. Sure there are typically the usual party issues like abortion rights and other social differences but it seems that the candidates are usually so far to the middle that there really aren't many differences on issues that really effect the everyday lives of the American people. It would be really refreshing to have two candidates that are complete polar opposites on most issues and are running on their beliefs and not what their benefactors pay them to believe in. ",1

A month is a long time when it comes to election season!

&gt;Citation please. That would seem like a really good thing for his opponents if he did.

I misspoke, as I somewhat conflated your article with another I just read in another thread. He has requested  other organizations calling themselves SuperPACs desist.

I feel like you're being a bit pedantic really, anyways. When you say something like ""Sanders has no SuperPAC"", as I said before what you're saying is that the group is not affiliated with or endorsed by the candidate.

From the very article linked to me:

&gt;“It’s not a super PAC, super PACs are corrupt,” RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, said. “They’re a way for the billionaires to influence the political process and spend unlimited money. This is nurses who want to get our support for Bernie out there. That’s way different than the Koch brothers. This isn’t big money. I think people understand the difference.”

and

&gt;Sanders, for his part, has forcefully and repeatedly insisted that he does not have—or want—a super PAC. His campaign has been explicit as well. Earlier this month, after the Associated Press reported that an Oakland-based progressive super PAC plans to spend money in support of Sanders, the campaign emailed supporters with the message: “we don’t want this super PAC’s help.” The campaign has also sent a cease and desist letter to another pro-Sanders super PAC, alleging a violation of federal law.  

and

&gt;“Do I have control over what private people do in the world? No. Do I wish people who want to set up super PACs would do that? No.""

&gt; “He can’t do anything to stop people from setting up super PACs, so he really is being honest when he says he doesn’t want them,” Cobble said. “If people don’t listen, that’s not his fault.”

As I said before, you can say Hillary ""has"" a superPAC. She's affiliated with it, she endorses it, it coordinates with her campaign, etc. like any superPAC would; SuperPACs claiming to be pro-Bernie lack those qualities. I genuinely think that is pretty night and day, don't you?",1

"&gt; Aww, thats cute, you're being defensive by being condescending.

No, just a statement of fact.  You have no clue how correlation affects risk modeling.

&gt;So if you buy 100 vcr's out of the back of 100 trucks, its some how magically going to be a good idea and you're not going to wind up with 100 boxes with bricks in them? Please.

100 VCRs would be perfectly correlated.  100 Mortgages from across the country were assumed to be completely uncorrelated. 

&gt;And here we are. I guess your ""correlation is the only thing that matters"" worldview is dogshit.

Why? 

&gt;No they don't, the forest is made of trees, 

Yes it does.  This is why I stated you have no understanding of finance.  Correlation between assets in a portfolio affects the riskiness of the asset.

http://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/corporate-finance/4/return-risk/expected-return.aspx

Please read this before many any further claims about portfolio risk.

&gt;I'm proving intent, not claiming that shorting securities was the driving motivation- they were making plenty of money selling these midas touched turds. Again, forty percent failure rate.

So the fact that a statistically insignificant amount of MBS were created through fraud shows the whole system was fraudulent?  Quite the jump there.

&gt;No, I already described many ways which a gold bar might be fraudulent

Again, you test something assumed to be completely correlated differently than something assumed to be completely uncorrelated.  Why can't you understand this?

&gt;Why do you keep trying to claim that diversification is some magical ointment that makes everything super awesome when it clearly isn't?

Because it is ""some magical ointment"".  Diversification takes a bunch of risky individual assets, and based on their correlation defines the riskiness of the portfolio of those assets.

&gt;Nobodies that got hustled into lying on their mortgage applications, no one of consequence, no one involved in this con.

Because by and large those were the only people committing fraud.

&gt;Yes, I am contesting the claim that it was legal for them to do what they did.

With what evidence?

&gt;FORTY PERCENT FAILURE RATE.

Do you have a citation for this number?

I tried to find one, and all I could find was 40% of sub prime mortgages were past due at one point in 2009.  Not that 40% of overall mortgages or MBS failed.

"Here's the newsletter he sent out to his constituents yesterday:

Dear Friend,

I want to share with you two truths.

The first truth is every member of Congress is expected to spend more time raising money than they are solving the problems you elected them to fix.

The second truth is this: I’m not going to do it. And if legislation I’m introducing passes, no Member of Congress can ever do it again.

Americans wonder why we haven’t defeated ISIS, secured our border, provided health care for veterans, or balanced our budget. Here’s why. Too many people in Washington are more focused on raising money than doing the job you elected them to do.

Let me peel the curtain back.

It hasn’t even been two years since I was first elected to represent Pinellas County residents in Congress. It was a special election where my Democratic opponent outraised me 3 to 1, where President Obama won twice previously, and where some in the GOP establishment turned their backs on me just days before the final votes were tallied.

Conceding that Washington has a money problem is not a new idea - but now I've lived it firsthand. And what you may not know is how much time decent, law-abiding members of Congress spend every day dialing for dollars – telling you, the voters who elected them, that they need your money. Even more disturbing, this daily recess from doing their official job is openly encouraged and, based on precedent, actually required.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently greeted an incoming crop of freshmen lawmakers with a prescribed schedule that highlighted fundraising “Call Time” of four hours a day as the chief priority for any new member of Congress. The actual time they suggested working in Congress each day - 2 hours! Every American should be outraged.

Unfortunately, the same standard also goes for Congressional lifers. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle confessed that “a senator has to raise $10,000 every day they’re in office – every day of their six years"" - just to get reelected.

And just this month, retiring Congressman Steve Israel, who ironically chaired the fundraising arm of the Democratic Party, lamented that he has spent roughly 4,200 hours on the phone asking people for money and attended more than 1,600 fundraisers while in office.

Think about it.

Instead of focusing the entirety of their attention on solutions to improve your economic security or our country’s national security, too many of our elected officials are prioritizing a whole different kind of security – their personal job security.

We can't have a part-time Congress in a full-time world.

This quiet truth cuts the deepest each time we witness a terror threat like we saw in San Bernardino, or each time government fails our veterans, or each year we watch our national debt explode. Think about it. Our nation is under siege by ISIS, and yet as my party’s best bet to win a U.S. Senate seat in Florida, I’m expected to be fighting for your safety from a fundraising call suite at party headquarters.

I won't do it.

It’s time members of Congress stop asking you for money and start doing their jobs.

That’s why, as I mentioned to you last week, I’m introducing legislation called the Stop Act.  It simply says that that no member of Congress may personally ask you for money.

This does not mean that you as a citizen cannot choose to contribute to a candidate. It is your constitutional right of political speech to do so.

But let's close the integrity gap and the performance gap of our elected officials by eliminating their fundraising solicitations and put them back to work doing the people’s business – protecting our homeland, creating jobs, reducing the debt, standing up for law enforcement, and doing real constituent service work that benefits you.

This simple fix already applies to judicial elections in 30 states across the country. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld a Florida statute that bans judicial candidates from personally asking their supporters for campaign contributions, rightfully declaring that a ""state’s decision to elect judges does not compel it to compromise public confidence in their integrity.""

Why should Congress be held to a weaker standard?

That’s why I am asking you to join me in this effort to change Washington forever. Contact your representative and tell them to sign the Stop Act. Tell them to stop asking you for money, and get back to work.

This may make a lot of folks in Washington uncomfortable, but it's about time.

With much respect,

In fact, he says that now that renewables provide 94.5% of the country’s electricity, prices are lower than in the past relative to inflation. There are also fewer power cuts because a diverse energy mix means greater resilience to droughts.

"&gt; Strong positive correlation between Republicans taking control of Congress and this stabilization. 

Stabilization began before Republicans took control, and progress on recovery flattened once the stimulus funds ran out and austerity from the sequestration kicked in. We didn't fall into a double dip recession, but neither did the recovery perform as well as it should have.

I think that's a good argument. I could see it become a state's issue, but perhaps he is arguing for more so he can net a higher minimum wage in the end. I still think $15 over 5 years is a feasible number nationally considering the growing wealth gap and what it *should* be after adjusting for inflation/automation like I said before. 

&gt;Also his calls for Glass Steagall is outdated as no other country has a similar policy and it would have done little to prevent the 08 meltdown.

I definitely don't think it would have stopped the crash from occurring, but it would have lightened the severity. Paul Krugman and Joseph Staglitz both agree that it was a component to the crisis. A modern Glass Steagall would help prevent future abuses (but like you mention won't prevent a crash for other sources). I mean even Warren and McCain cosponsered a reinstatement of Glass Steagall! There is bipartisan interest.

&gt;You go to a public university for free and pay x% of your paycheck for a certain number of years. You can offset the % with added Wall Street taxes if you really wanted to but I would rather use that money for general childhood education.

That is a more conservative way of going about it and I am not opposed to that idea. I'm not sure how that would be regulated for unemployment (or intentional underemployment? for X number of years). I definitely like the idea.

&gt;Obamacare is the foundation as we move towards universal healthcare and we as a country are not ready for single payer. The next stepping stone is instituting a public option but that won't be possible if Obamacare is thrown out or scrapped for more ambitious plans. Bernie's plans would surely be dragged before the Supreme Court and I am not willing to bet the progress of Obamacare on a traditionally conservative institution.

I don't agree that the country is not ready for single payer. Most people want it! That I guess is just a differing of opinion. I think after the next two supreme court justices are appointed by the next president, it will be possible for such a policy to be considered constitutional. That is only a guess because even the most liberal minded justice might find single payer unconstitutional. Why? I am not sure. I'm not exactly the best at interpreting judicial reasoning.

&gt;I see Bernie continuing Obama's foreign policy which hasn't been cohesive. I don't think Bernie has the enthusiasm for foreign policy that Clinton does and foreign affairs is one of the few things the President is relatively autonomous on.

That may be true. I do like that Sanders was the first (before it was cool) to propose a coalition of the Muslim community to do their fair share in the region. At least in the countries that don't seem to be contributing much at the moment. I do agree that Hillary has a more hands-on approach to foreign policy.

It relied on self-reported survey data, it didn't consider new entry and restaurants which closed, and it was with respect to a much smaller minimum wage shift.

"&gt;  What difference in the real world does it make if you personally participate in the democracy that is the United States, compared to if you don't participate in the democracy that is the United States?

Elected officials are not then actually representative of their constituents, which is what a democracy is based on.  That means the decisions the elected officials make may not be representative of the constituents.  That's how you get laws no one supports but a select few.

&gt;  Let's say you chose to vote and the final tally ended up 93458 for candidate A and 83486 for candidate B. What difference in the real world does it make if you had instead chosen not to vote, and the tally ended up 93457 for candidate A to 83486 for candidate B?

You have no idea going in how the votes will turn out.  It could just as easily have been 93457 to 93456.  The point is that the only way to truly know what candidate any given electorate supports is for everyone to vote.

&gt;  That's a nice false dichotomy you've got going on there. ""Either everyone must live under the delusion that their vote matters, or we must be ruled by a dictator! There is no other way!""

It's not a false dichotomy.  It's the end result of everyone adopting your mindset.  Without votes, what means are there to establish a leader other than whoever takes over by force?

Do you want to see a good example of what happens when people don't vote?  Look at the current members in office for the federal government.  When a larger percent of the population turns up to vote, a democrat is elected president.  Elections from non-presidential years have a much lower turnout and republicans have dominated those recently because they maintain better turnout for those elections.",1

The evidence does not support that POV.

Conservative estimates indicate that around 37% of Americans are gun owners, or almost 119 million citizens.  12,624 intentional homicides is only 0.01% of potential gun owners, which means **99.99% of gun owners are not running around shooting other people.**  People killed by big black scary-looking rifles is even significantly less likely at 0.00027% or not caused by 99.99973% of gun owners.

&gt; In ***New Hampshire,*** Sanders outpaces Clinton by more than two-to-one among likely Democratic primary voters who identify as independent. **Clinton leads by a wide margin, 18 points, among likely voters who are Democrats.**

Democrats are still holding strong for Hillary.

***New Hampshire*** - NBC/WSJ/Marist 1/2 - 1/7 425 LV 4.8 **50** 46 1 Sanders +4; 

Both polls are showing mirror reactions; More 'undecided' are for Sanders in Iowa, more 'undecided' are for Hillary in N.H.

Edit - why is this getting downvoted? It is a page of facts.

**Notation - My viewpoint**; Nothing really as moved in either case. Hillary is still up around + 12.0 in Iowa and Sanders is at + 7 in N.Hampshire. Nothing in the data suggests such sudden shifts (while not wanting to call this an outlier, the polling data relied to much on independent voters). 

**Notation 2 - My viewpoint**; Both states are pretty much 'in-play' atm; What troubles me, is Sanders shift to Nevada. I would think his time would be better spent in Iowa.

"First off, *every* politician, especially conservative ones, blame a lack of mental health services when it comes to mass shootings. Conservatives especially use this as a scapegoat rather than focusing on guns. 

But let's address the difference.

1. There's a difference between pointing out that the country needs better mental healthcare services and saying ""mass shootings are happening because the president doesn't understand what mass shooters go through"".
2. Advocating for better mental healthcare doesn't take away the personal responsibility for the actions of Mass shooters. The vast majority of them are severely mentally ill, but we don't automatically absolve them of guilt because of it.
3. It doesn't politicize a serious issue that shouldn't be turned into a partisan one. Even though conservatives in congress have refused to pass a bill that would expand mental healthcare (while simultaneously blaming mass shootings on mental illness), you don't see Sanders using this to attack conservatives.",34

"I have seen multiple statements from FBI spokespeople saying they aren't even investigating Clinton personally but rather if she was a victim. 

Politifact addressed this but I've seen it other places as well.
&gt;Actually, Clinton is not under FBI investigation. The inquiry to which Bush refers revolves around the private email server Clinton used while serving as secretary of state.  And it is not a criminal investigation.

The NYT fucked up their email story royally 

&gt;Soon after, the New York Times incorrectly reported that the inspectors general requested a criminal investigation into Clinton’s email use — as opposed to a security referral. But the newspaper later issued two corrections. The referral was in connection with Clinton’s account, not whether Clinton herself mishandled information, and did not allege criminal activity.

&gt;Officials told reporters at the time that the FBI was not targeting Clinton specifically.

"I'm not sure how we're reading the same quote in two entirely different ways. In context, the article mentions that Sanders' plan shifts roughly $117B in costs to the top five percent of income earners, while payroll taxes would provide an additional $432B. However, as the article mentions, this still leaves a $599B shortfall as compared to 2013 health care costs. 

The expert is saying that you'd need to cut 42%-47% from costs in order to make up that $599B shortfall, but most experts believe that 20% is probably the absolute largest amount you could reasonably expect to cut from costs. 

So, how does that save money? Based on those numbers, let's say $599B = ~45% cost savings. If 20% is the upper limit, then that leaves us with, what, around $250B or so still unaccounted for? Tell me what I'm missing, or where I got it wrong.",1

Legalize marijuana

gays are cool, let them get married

support veterans (homeless problem, health care, mental care)

illegal immigration is bad for middle and lower class workers (stronger border control I guess) and also to restrict gun/human/drug trafficing

Less money in politics (bernie has that one covered for sure)

smaller government, less regulations for small business

I like guns. Background checks for safety of course. No restrictions on semi automatic assault rifles. They literally kill the least amount of people per year compare to other types of guns, including fists? Yup.

"I would definitely disagree. I can easily say Trump is my favorite Republican candidate, with Rand, Kasich, and 2008 Christie right behind. I can also say that I absolutely despise the amount of misinformation that Megyn Kelly and Fox news imparts upon their viewers. With both of those said, Kelly did absolutely nothing wrong. Trump did in fact make sexist comments, and was called out for it. This might be considered a personal attack to Trumpeters. But to most people, it's a relevant question, and should remain relevant to anyone who wants to be popular among women voters. Trumps obsession with her, and subsequent absence at the debate, could be a huge mistake. After all, the old adage is that even bad publicity is good publicity. When he loses out on 'face time' with the American audience, he definitely doesn't win. Couple that with the fact that conservatives, independents, and democrats are all labeling this as the best moderated debate thus far. I think Fox actually comes off as big winners. They did better than the last debate, when Trump was actually on stage.

"&gt; the technicality is the important part of the scare-tactic he's attempting

""the scare tactic.""

&gt; The technicality -that what she was actually talking about was assault weapons, not ""guns"" in general- is the important part. Without that technical obfuscation, Cruz's accusation has no weight, and he wouldn't have said it. 

Without the obfuscation that you accuse him of, that you called a ""scare tactic""?

&gt; He wasn't just trying to come up with a scenario where some guns were confiscated, he was talking about all guns.

This, right here. **You** said he was talking about **all guns**. You typed those words. Prove that he is talking about all guns. 

&gt; The actual important point in this current discussion is the intent of framing that quote as being about something it demonstrably is not, and using that framing as a scare-tactic. 

Framing it as something it's not. Again you say he's framing it as being about all guns. Yet you cannot prove that he is.

&gt; He used a functionally-false statement, most likely because it had a greater emotional weight when phrased as he did.

You asserted that the reason it's ""False"" instead of ""Half Truth"" or any of the other rating is because he obfuscated that she was wanted to take all guns as a scare tactic. Everything you've said is based on that. If he isn't talking about all guns, he's not fear mongering, there's no reason for the obfuscation you accused him of. 

You accused him of obfuscation, your evidence for that accusation is that he is talking about all guns. Please prove that he is talking about all guns.

Trump raised money for vets according to who? All donations were made to the Trump Foundation. We just found out Wounded Warriors hardly spends over half their money for vets, what makes you think an organization like the Trump Foundation is going to make ""100%"" of it go to vets?

The truth was it was never about the vets. It was about Trump's ego and his cowardly decision to cut and run from the debate. Every other candidate stood in there and took questions. Just because they're tough doesn't make them ""gotcha"" questions. People like to use that word to immediately discredit the substance of the issue.

In the first debate, Trump was rightfully asked about his sexist comments. Even in the last 24 hours he's called Megyn Kelly a bimbo. Yeah. Doesn't sound like a sexist to me!

The fact that the previous Iowa winners, who are charting at maybe 2% all together, were with him, doesn't mean anything. They want free press and they think being there with Trump will help out.

The numbers have come back, and viewership wasn't brought down massively at all. In fact, all of Trump's viewership on the combined networks MIGHT have reached 25% of the debate's totals. And that's with it being on about half a dozen channels.

I'm going to throw some bullshit illustrative numbers here that don't accurately reflect reality, but they're fairly accurately depicting the process that's going on.

Let's assume we have four districts. Assume that the person who gets the most votes wins, regardless of whether that's a majority or not. (That's not necessarily true in real elections, but still).

If the districts are *not* segregated, and if everyone votes for their group, the white group gets all 4 districts, 100% of the representation, and the other groups get nothing.

However, if you separate districts based on likely interest groups (in this case, race), you end up where each district ends up with nearly 100% of their people voting for a given candidate (instead of voting according to their proportion of the population), and each race gets 25% of the representation.

In that case, the second, segregated, district scheme actually ends up with *more* equal representation, not less.

The trick isn't drawing districts. The trick is doing so in a way that better represents interest *groups* instead of just particular interests.",10

I'm saying that people not taking personal responsibility is a root cause of these unwanted pregnancies. Don't be so naive as to think that my whole stance is based on an opposition of those without personal responsibility.

&gt; Now then. Not having subsidized condoms, is something that affects poor people, a group already notable for having a lot of unwanted kids, possibly because of reasoning above. A richer person won't even notice the added cost. Someone living paycheck-to-paycheck would. Yet there's the option to not use condoms, and save a bit of money. People on occasion take this option.

First, I'd ask how you plan to put this into effect. Would this be a government mandate placed on private corporations? Or would it be as it is now where the federal government funds businesses like Planned Parenthood?

If it's the first, it'd be grossly unconstitutional as it violates the allowance of religious freedom by forcing adherence to doctrinal violations.

&gt; Well, one of the supposed reasons why poor people have a lot of kids, is that sex is one of the few free avenues of entertainment that is both very enjoyable and, as I said, free.

Now then. Not having subsidized condoms, is something that affects poor people, a group already notable for having a lot of unwanted kids, possibly because of reasoning above. A richer person won't even notice the added cost. Someone living paycheck-to-paycheck would. Yet there's the option to not use condoms, and save a bit of money. People on occasion take this option.

Forgive me if I misinterpreted you, but basically what you're insinuating is that the rich should pay for the entertainment of the poor by paying for their subsidized condoms that reduce that risk of them having to face the consequences of their actions. This is absolutely ridiculous - why don't the rich pay for the poor's movie tickets instead, would that fix the problem?

&gt; Are you against the killing of fetuses, or is this about a vendetta on people without a lot of personal responsibility?

I'm against the killing of ""fetuses"" and am saying that a root cause of the controversy is a condoned lack of personal responsibility on the part of those conceiving unwanted children.

&gt; That second quote, up there, though, that speaks of a mentality that's more about blaming people than about actually solving the stated problem vis-a-vis 'the killing of fetuses.' The reason I say this is because the context of that quote doesn't... make a lot of sense.

No, I'm not focusing on berating those that lack personal responsibility, I'm identifying it as a key contributor to the problem.

&gt; You agree that insufficient sex-ed is partly to blame, but expect everyone to know about condoms somehow anyways? You can see how I might be confused by that.

I'm saying I support comprehensive sex ed, whatever that may encompass, but honestly can't fathom how anyone on their own can't find out what condoms are or how to use them, especially in such a connected era what with the Internet.

Was it the lack of birth control, condoms, or abortions (especially free ones) that so severely hurt the poor during the 1960's? Oh wait, that problem wasn't at the forefront of pressing social issues. And, huh, look here. Out of wedlock birthrates during the 60's was at 5%. Guess what it's at today.

41%.

A lack of social stigma against ""illegitimate"" births likely contributed to this rise, among other things, and this disappearance of a stigma has been subconsciously appreciated by social progressives despite it's negative effects.",0

"Well, I have kind of grappled with this concept for years now. But the whole idea of ""white guilt"" has gotten more attention recently, and affirmative action policies have been around for a while. So I believe that guilt has nothing to do with these types of scholarships. 

First, a lot of scholarships come from private groups. They set the criteria. And often that criteria is based on the personal preferences and experiences of the people who donate money. For example, a single mother who is a nurse may donate money to give scholarships to single mothers trying to become nurses.

Second, minority scholarships make more sense on a large scale than a small scale. If you just look at two people, and they seem to have all the same qualifications, of course it looks ""wrong"" to pick one guy over the other because of skin color/race. However, I believe the goal is to take into account living situations. Let's imagine that the white guy went to a fancy private school and the minority did not. We could make a whole lot of other assumptions based purely on demographic statistics in the U.S. 

Ideally, I believe these types of scholarships/ideas/policies are supposed to function as demographic equalizers, if that makes sense.",0

The ACA uses threat of force to get everyone to buy health insurance, and fixed amounts of it, so that certain target groups will receive subsidies and, after becoming reliant on these subsidies, will forever be bound to vote for the party that will defend the ACA.

Pretty much everyone pays a tax of some sort in society, and many people pay a disproportionate amount of taxes for things they don't even want.  Just because a person is not wealthy doesn't mean their contributions do not have the same impact - it affects them as much, if not more, than a rich person's share of taxes. We have an infrastructure that advantages owners of property, wealth, capital, assets, and our taxes contribute to that infrastructure.  If stealing to construct that infrastructure is ok, then we should also be able to balance the scale and build the infrastructure in a way that advantages the less-privileged to get guaranteed healthcare at a low cost and provide for unemployment insurance and higher education, for example.  I don't see why my taxes should support a system of private property ownership, but if it has to, and people are stealing from me to uphold that system, then I don't see what is wrong with getting some free healthcare out of that deal.",1

Ask Diane Feinstein. 

&gt;He could have used Hillary and Obama's support of Australian ""mandatory buybacks"" as an example and the important part, the POINT of the statement would not change.

He could have, but he didn't. He used a functionally-false statement, most likely because it had a greater emotional weight when phrased as he did. In other words:

HE MISCHARACTERIZED FACTS TO SUPPORT AN EMOTIONAL NARRATIVE.

That's the fucking *definition* of fear-mongering. It doesn't matter how factual the actual underlying situation *is*, when he's chosen to utilize fictional emotional tools to support it. This is the equivalent of supporting Trump's ""they're bringing rapists"" spiel by pointing out that rape is indeed still a concern and sometimes rapists *are* mexican. 

Those facts don't change the fact that his presentation was done for the purposes of scaring people(specifically, *those* people), and did so with a narrative that's easily shown to be false.

This was further outlined in the 1772 British Nationality Act which changed the requirement that both parents be subjects of the crown to only the father be a subject of the crown.

"&gt; Why then don't we have more religious trappings in schools and throughout the gov't system? What accounted for the sea change?

The Supreme Court started to hold such trappings and displays to be unconstitutional.

&gt;At the minimum, everyone agrees that the state cannot prefer a faith above another, but why stop there? What brings it to a full stop right there? The rejection of all religion gets us to no establishment of religion as much as allowing religion up to the point of establishment.

Because the standard of constitutional review is not ""the broadest possible restriction"" or ""the restriction which will ensure no potential interference.""

Your logic would also have us say that because ""no restrictions on free speech ever"" gets us to freedom of speech as much as ""restrictions on obscenity are constitutional"", the former must be adhered to. And I doubt that you like the outcome of such an expansive reading of constitutional law.

The short answer to your question is: because that's not necessarily (depending on when the Court heard the case) what the constitution requires.

Your argument is a policy argument: we should protect against any intermingling of government and religion more strictly than the constitution requires. But that does not change what the constitution itself requires.

&gt;The statement you responded to was written in regard to your claim that no trampling occurred. Your response seems to be that everyone gets trampled

Ah, I was hoping you'd look at the statement regarding *Brown* and say ""huh, I don't see that as a trampling because I'm not convinced the right to segregate was a valid right to begin with, maybe I'm allowing my own policy preferences to influence my reading of the constitution.""

&gt;But short of that, what would he do? Would he accept all kids being required to bow their heads? Would he accept non praying kids being escorted out for juice? Who knows?

Compulsory speech is not the same thing as prayer being allowed.

And ""this interpretation of the constitution is wrong because it doesn't provide a complete answer to all potential questions"" is just farkakte. It'd be like being against the ruling in *Brown* and the logic of desegregation because we *still* haven't fully resolved affirmative action issues.",1

"I don't buy this explanation. Greanted my experience is anecdotal, but hear me out.

I come from Ohio where we have a lot of independents, a lot of democrats with some conservative values, and a lot of republicans with some liberal values. Sure, Cleveland and to a lesser extent Cinncinatti are liberal bastions, but you get a lot of political greys everywhere else. And a LOT of my centrist, independent, and mildly conservative friends are liking Bernie the more they hear about him.

I think it's a misreading of the political dynamic in this country that there's a single left-to-right spectrum and that people will vote for whoever is closest to them on it. Under this view Bernie is all the way to the left and can't possibly get the support of people in the middle.

But our reality is much more complicated. A lot of the people I know who fall into the middle don't really know shit about the economy and they know they don't really know shit about the economy. A lot of them have strong social views, a decent number of them think homosexuality is a sin for example, but even on those issues, if you talk to them like a human being instead of a political opponent, they will often admit that it's not the governments role to enforce issues of morality. Maybe they think taxes are bad or a violation of the american dream, but they also think things like medical help should be available to everyone, and again, if you don't put them into an emotional corner by ""talking down"" to them, they will often say that they don't really know what the best way to get this stuff done is.

What a lot of them care about most is how they are talked to. They would rather elect someone who they disagree with and who they think is being strait with them then they would someone who they think is feeding them bullshit. These people won't vote for another Clinton or Bush if their life depended on it, and it had fuck all to do with policies. They don't feel like Clinton or Bush say what they mean and they don't like it. They don't trust Rubio much either, though they think he's a bit more real.

Ask an Ohioan about our Governor and almost everyone, from both sides of the political line, say ""he's been ok."" We don't love him, we don't hate him. He's done some stuff that's good, hasn't done anything aweful. We don't feel like he lies to us, but he doesn't inspire us either. He was the ""meh"" that we could all compromise on, and we're mostly alright with that. But he's not going to enthuse a huge turnout in his favor either.

Some of these people support Paul. He'd be my second choice personally. More revealing are the number of these politically centrist Ohioans who support Trump. And it's weird, because if you ask them about it, they all know the shit he says is racist. None of them are in support of banning muslims or building a wall. They think these are terrible ideas. But they like the way he talks. They like that he just says these things, these absolutely horrible things, without focus grouping every word. They don't respect his ideas but they respect that he doesn't *censor* his ideas, and are willing to support him on those grounds alone.

But now they are starting to hear about Sanders. Those of us who live on reddit have trouble understanding just how many people still barely know who he is. But a lot of my centrist Ohio friends are really only just noticing. And they like him for the same reasons they like trump. They don't necessarily think universal health care is possible or that universal higher education is a good idea. A lot of them think a $15 minimum wage is idiotic. But when they watch him speak they notice that he says what he thinks without worrying about what other people think about what he thinks.

I think we are in an age where the political center just wants someone to be real with them. That's why Trump is so popular, and the same with Bernie. And everytime we talk about this popularity we miss the point. Every story is how Trumps popularity shows how racist republicans really are and how Sanders popularity shows how many people want government handouts or whatever. And yea, there are groups on both sides for who that's true, but I think such analysis are missing the bigger trend. What people really want is to know who they are dealing with, regardless of their agreement.

And so what I'm watching happen is a lot of these people sitting down and deciding which to chose between two ideas that they don't think are logical. As they see it, the two most straight forward candidates offer a choice between irrational fear and isolationism vs irrational naivety that we can all hold hands and work together. And they don't really buy either side of it, only they respect the bluntness that the views are being communicated. And so to them it's not a choice of what is actually the right thing to do but, in the end I think if they have to decide between two honestly spoken impossibilities, a lot of them would rather go with the one that is an expression of naive and impossible to realize ideals of community.

And I don't agree with them. I believe in Sanders' policies. I don't think they are naive. I'm just trying to, as objectively as possible, describe the emotional process I'm witnessing in a lot of my centrist friends. I know it was a bit of a ramble, but thanks for sticking with me if you did.

**TL;DR:** a lot of political centrists, anecdotally anyway, are growing to like Sanders the more they hear about him, including a decent number of former Trump supporters.",23

"&gt;It isn't enough for Hillary to have sent classified info over a private server

Yes it is. It doesn't matter if she's aware how classified the documents are. In fact, its way worse if she doesn't, because it means nobody, be it her or anyone who works for her, is labeling and protecting data as theyre legally obligated to.

But the important thing to consider is Hillary did not handle her email the way her predecessors did. She had her own private account opened, used it for work emails, and classified data got onto it. Classified data was not allowed to be on her email OR her official work email, as the state department's email isn't secure either. But here we are, still trying to figure out how much classified data is there, and god forbid how much got out.

[NYTimes had a bit to say about it.](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/08/15/us/fbi-tracking-path-of-email-to-hillary-clinton-at-state-department.html?_r=0&amp;referer=http://m.dailykos.com/story/2015/8/28/1416309/-Hillary-Clinton-s-Felony-The-federal-laws-violated-by-the-private-server)

&gt;The investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails has its roots in her decision to use only a private email account for her official business when she was secretary of state, an unorthodox decision that gave her some control over what was made public. She faced criticism when her use of the account became known this year, and after deleting what she said were more than 31,000 personal emails, she turned over more than 30,000 work-related emails for the State Department to make public.

&gt;Mrs. Clinton has said that her emails contained no classified information — having classified information outside a secure government account is illegal — and that she is fully cooperating with the investigation. But in reviewing a sampling of the emails for potential security breaches, Mr. McCullough said he found four out of 40 that contained classified information, though perhaps stripped of any indication that it was of classified origin.

"You're right. Here in Canada the NDP, the historical socialist (but now social democratic) party came *very* close to winning government in Canada by touting that they were the ones to first advocate all the government programs Canadians love: Socialized healthcare, the Canadian Pension Plan, vacation days, et cetera. They finished 2nd in 2011, but fell back to 3rd in 2015 when the Liberals arguably campaigned to the left of them. 

I'm going to sound like a right-winger when I type this, but I really do consider myself a liberal, and perhaps a social democrat. I care a lot more about income inequality and poverty than ""economic freedom"" or whatever.

The reason that Bernie calls himself a socialist is because he really was a socialist in name and in policy back in the 70s, like a lot of people on the left. We've all kind of learned that while pure capitalism doesn't work, pure socialism doesn't either, and the government shouldn't run, say, Google. I think Bernie has learned that too. Rather than change how he labels himself, and risk being seen as a flip-flopper, he's adjusted his political stances to something somewhat more workable and packaged them under the same term ""socialism"". 

But who knows, sometimes definitions change. It's just at some point someone on the right is going to say ""hey, what about Venezuela"".

Also, I think you're right when you talk about demonizing rich people. There's assholes like the Koch brothers and the Waltons, but there's also decent billionaires out there who are doing great things for society, like Bill Gates post-2008 or Warren Buffet or Elon Musk.

"Ok, thank you for giving a *substantive* reply to my above comment. That thanks is genuine: you don't see it often on /r/politics.

Now on to the substance of your comment.

I think you're making a mistake here on what exactly is reliable: it's about year-old spreads between Democrats and Republicans accurately tracking election-day spreads between Democrats and Republicans. That's surely not reliable. I'm in agreement with you on this. 

But preference rankings does provide a basis for ranking for one Democrat over another Democrat when it comes to choosing which Democrat will run in the general election. It's just a weak one. And you and I are in agreement over this.

We can construct a bizarre case to show how it's just *prima facie* a great choice to make, all things considered: everyone polled says Billary is preferable to Republicans than Hernie. The split is insane: 90% prefer Billary over Republicans while only 10% prefer Hernie over Republicans. Even though betting on Billary isn't a sure thing, it's better to choose Billary over Hernie for the general election if this was the spread.

This provides a basis (much stronger than our current one!) for preferring Billary over Hernie to run against Republicans, but it would be a silly mistake to infer that a year from now that Billary will secure 90% of the vote!

I hope that makes sense to you.

And thanks for amending your argument in response to my comments. I disagree with you that the basis is so weak that it can be ignored. It's a form of evidence, after all, so it adds *something* (although it may be very small) when we're making the choice between Sanders and Hillary.",2
"Is this inherently better than just giving more benefits to the working poor, or the poor generally? It seems to arrive at similar ends but avoids the pitfalls. No unnecessary barrier to entering the workforce, no problem for low wage employers who might be forced to fold of automate. 

My issue with minimum wage is that it is in direct conflict with other benefits to the poorer classes which are income based. Having both is an attempt to feed the poor with two bites of the same treat. If we're relying on economic feedback effects to magnify the impact on demand (spurring employment back to normal etc), it should not matter if that money gets to workers via a pay raise or to workers and the unemployed etc via the treasury.

Thus, minimum wage shouldn't be analyzed in a vacuum. If your goal is economic growth or increasing quality of life from the bottom, there's many ways to do those, with fewer obvious downsides that are unpredictable. ",1
"The indis are very important... but not as important as the polls present, let me explain why.

In no state that I am aware of is any one person allowed to vote twice. Now, in many states one person can vote on any party race, or if registered independent can vote on any party race.

But they can only do so once.

So, in many states, with Trump doing so well among independents, and Sanders doing so well among independents, these voters will be forced to choose... who do they vote for? Or against? If they want to vote for Trump, they can't vote for Sanders, and vice versa.

I'm going to imagine both Sanders and Trump split the independent vote 50/50, which will yield them roughly 10% to 15% of their support. In all polling data I can find, that will translate to a loss in support for both candidates by roughly 10%.

"My point was for your last sentence. Just because you can pay for your 3 year old's education, doesn't mean that some other 3 year old elsewhere has parents who can.

As for your other things (a lot of which don't come even close to applying now)

&gt; A federal grant for low income students with good grades. That was in 1986 (I think it was called a pell grant).

I too have a federal pell grant. You know how much that give me per year? 6,000 max.

&gt; The grant didn't cover all my costs and I did not attend the school I wanted to go, but one I could afford.

So cost was detrimental to your growth. You went to a worse school for economic reasons rather than academic ones. That should not exist. If you can get into a school, you should be able to go to that school.

&gt; I lived with my parents and took the bus to school.

Obviously not everyone can do that. Some people, like myself, live in the middle of nowhere with no college, even community ones, for hours in any direction.

&gt; I took a part-time job at school

Maybe in the 90's that covered the costs for school, but that doesn't even come close to covering costs now

I respectfully disagree with that assessment of the middle class in the U.S. simply because microeconomic stats and long-term economic trends are in conflict with what macroeconomic stats suggest is going on.  Macroeconomic stats do not reveal the distributional disconnect that Free Trade and a number of other public policies and legislation have caused and continue to worsen. It's why pre-Depression income/wealth disparity rates in the U.S. have arisen after the country avoided them for decades (i.e., 1940-1980).

Bear in mind that the lower class was not reduced in a meaningful way in the U.S. until the country gave rise to the middle class through labor rights and a number of other legislative/economic measures since the 1930's.  This nation's economic and political history tell us a lot about what has worked and stands a chance of working again.

The only ""glass ceilings"" I believe in are those on the economic extremes of the spectrum simply because it is economically counterproductive to gravitate toward extreme socio-economic conditions in either direction or both simultaneously (i.e., hollowing out the middle).  Metaphorically speaking, it's why price/quantity extremes on a basic supply/demand chart are unsustainable, while market equilibrium is not.",1

"&gt; physical altercation

What physical altercation? This does not happen in the video. Garner absolutely does not touch them. He is speaking in an upset manner, but never touches them. The chokehold in question refers to a few minutes into the argument, when the officer approaches Garner, who says ""Please don't touch me"" a few times and tries to back away. There is NO physical altercation in which Garner is the aggressor with officers.

What breaking the law? The officers approached Garner and in his view, and the view of the bystander recording -- who approaches the officers himself early on in the video to confirm his account -- he was not doing anything when approached by the police. The fact is that the police were NOT dispatched to the area to deal with Garner, they were dispatched because of a fight that Garner helped to stop. He is protesting with them and ""resisting arrest"" because he clearly feels like a victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Later on in the video, in fact, you hear other bystanders approaching the police, horrified, confirming this version of events.

"&gt; In violation of existing gun laws. Unlicensed carry. The definition of ""illegal"" varies from each jurisdiction.

Again, what you're describing is about *who* is carrying the gun, rather than about the gun itself. Also, this is already a crime that carries with it additional penalties.

&gt; If by ""ownership"" you're talking about whether it's legal for the criminal to own a weapon and whether it's properly licensed, that is what I mean by ""illegal"" or jlegal. Again, I wasn't more specific as the laws vary so much from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Weapons almost never require licensing. Only machine guns, and rifles considered ""assault weapons"" in specific states (namely CA and NY) need to be registered, plus some exotic categories if I recall correctly. These weapons are almost never used in crimes. Also they already do carry extra penalties for possession.

States like CA do require gun permits, but again that's the person registering themselves. Guns themselves do not need to be registered.

&gt; There are licensing issues most places. There is the requirement for a ""carry license"".

So you're agreeing with me? CCWs are obtained for *people* who carry guns, not the guns themselves. Like I said weapons violations almost always revolves around *who* is carrying rather than *what* gun they're carrying

&gt; And, of course, many jurisdictions ban certain types of firearms.

Again, these guns are rarely used in crimes.",1

"What risk? Hospitals aren't over leveraging CDOs against derivatives. Competition for non elastic goods like this isn't good. Despite what people think, health care actually has a very limited supply route. You going to your GP for a basic physical isn't what drives health care costs. The chronically ill and seriously injured are what drive health care costs. You can't have a different hospital in every town, it would be wildly inefficient for both hospital(very low income and inability to a full array of timely services due to such) and patient(who might be forced to go to a never ending list of hospitals because hospital X could only afford one MRI machine and it broke so now they went to hospital Y, but they also needed whatever done that hospital Y couldn't do, so now they're at hospital Z). I also can't import MRI scans or ERs from Missouri(or hop on a plane on a whim to go there) if I find a local service inadequate like I can with apples and furniture. Then you have to combine limited supply routes with the public necessity part, namely people will basically pay almost whatever to not die. This basic reality in itself distorts any pretense of normal market reactions. These aren't new ideas, they're ideas that were accepted by the 1890s with other public essentials, water(I have news for libertarians, numerous American cities by 1900 had tried privatized water supply systems, they all failed for the same reasons listed above), electricity, even street cars(where private lines had to be heavily regulated to keep from gouging prices).

"It **becomes** a criminal investigation once the FBI and its 100 investigators purposed decide that they have compelling enough evidence to declare the investigation surrounding Hillary and her activities while Secretary to have become criminal.

In other words, these are programs that the highest-level officials in an administration rely on and which correspond to national security priorities in a big way.

Who did she send this information on to? Were all of these people cleared? Did they all receive the information on approved servers? If so, did any of them ask why it was that Hillary was sending high level secrets around on a disapproved server? How did she get this information, which is stored in facilities that are completely detached from the public internet and telecommunications systems, and which explicitly bar removing information from them, onto an insecure email server? Who did that for her? That's illegal. Totally illegal. She had to know that. What's more, access to the data she had on that server is audited. It is possible for the FBI to know everyone who ever had access to specific data she shared, and to probably figure out which of her aides took it from those facilities. Shouldn't they be questioned?

David Petraeus was indicted, prosecuted, and convicted for doing the exact same thing, and probably to a lesser extent.

&gt;Now, let’s imagine the future. What if he fails to comply, and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this program of weapons of mass destruction and continue to press for the release of the sanctions and continue to ignore the solemn commitments that he made? Well, he will conclude that the international community has lost its will. He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. And some day, some way, I guarantee you, he’ll use the arsenal. And I think every one of you who’s really worked on this for any length of time believes that, too",3

Only problem is the rich have most of their money in investments that grow faster than that.  So the dollar buys 20% less, but they have 25% more dollars.  In the end it's the middle class that suffers.

"Since when is holding someone accountable for a crime a GOP talking point? It's ridiculous that people are willing to hate too big to jail while at the same time accepting it as long as it means their chosen candidate gets to run the country. How the hell does a base cry out for equal treatment of everyone by law then not want equal treatment for their leader who they are choosing to be the shining example of their professed ideals. It's ironic as hell if you ask me. 

If you look at the facts it really is not at GOP talking point. As soon as the FBI recovers the deleted files the State department is like ""oops, hey guys there's thousands of more emails we just didn't know about but just coincidentally found after you recovered our files"". That mixed with them seeking a month delay to get them through the first few primaries and not giving enough time for them to be analyzed before super Tuesday just looks blatantly obvious that they are hiding something big. The worst part is Clinton would rather have the Democrats lose than have them win without her. She's hoping there will be too much momentum going for her to lose the primaries after those emails are released, but that's not the worst part. The worst part is that in having her delay the release of them she is gambling with a chance to give the white house to the Republicans, as nobody is going to put a criminal in the White house if she is indicted. She would rather risk a Republican president and losing it all for dems than give the voters fairness in knowing what's in her emails before choosing a candidate in the primaries. It's just so obvious that her number one goal is winning, not for the people, not for the Democrats, but for herself.

We don't call it terrorism when a bank robber holds up a bank and takes hostages. Despite the ""threat of violence"" actually being there.

Have you ever heard of bank robbers being referred to as terrorists?

In this case, the people holding up the federal building have a feud with the federal government that has lasted a while, and it has not been actually violent in this case.

&gt;Disputes between cattle ranchers and the federal government over management of the MNWR have gone on for ""generations"" and the situation has regularly deteriorated to taunts and threats directed at federal officials from ranchers since at least the early 1970s 

In this case, it is a land, tax, sentencing/imprisonment, and property dispute.

&gt;Lest any of my friends supporting Sanders call me a squish, I’d note that I’ve been touting the benefits of single payer for years. In various forms it has been tried and worked far better than our system in every other advanced country in the world. In places like France or Germany or Japan, everyone is covered, the quality of care is as good or better than what Americans get, and it costs dramatically less than our bloated, inefficient system. But — and it’s a big “but” — moving from our current system to a single-payer system would be an extremely complicated endeavor, both practically and politically. If you tried to do it all at once, the opposition from both Republicans and the affected industries would make the fights over Bill Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s health-care plans look like nap time at the preschool.

"Not a popular opinion around these parts but unless the government gets really lucky and writes perfect legislation from the onset, I don't think the government can make universal healthcare fiscally responsible. 

This really isn't a critique of Universal Healthcare in particular, its a critique on Government itself in the US. Specifically its inability/unwillingness to correct mistakes/issues until it becomes an out of control problem. 

Social Security is a classic example of this. Right after it was passed there were numerous complaints brought about the long term viability of the program (specifically in cases where the number of payers would be eclipsed by the number of payees, some going so far as to call it a ponzi scheme in the 1930/40s). Instead of fixing this issue in the 1930s (which would have required raising taxes from 2% to something like 3% to pay for existing people over retirement age while making the system fiscally solvent essentially indefinitely) this can was kicked down the road. Even today we are kicking this can down the road and we are getting close to the point which would require some pretty brutal choices are going to have to be made to resolve this (which are going to be bad for the economy, retirees, or both). 

A more recent example is the ACA itself. There are numerous issues that have yet to be resolved. While you can say ""republican obstructionism!"" the reality is that there will always be obstructionist forces on either the right or the left preventing change with any existing major legislative measure. Getting these changes through is hard even when everyone may have agreed on the original proposal (since these changes are stand alone there is no room for a tit-for-tat trade that is present in a larger bill).

Likely not much, but long term there are far better uses for even than $210 than getting a slip of paper with numbers on it every week and fantasizing about a big win. Yes you can, ""Do stuff already,"" but $210 more to work with can let you do that stuff even more. I know, maybe you don't want to or need to do it more, but that's not really the point.

I'm not anti-lottery because I want to feel intellectually superior, I'm anti-lottery because lotteries are quite literally dumb and can be quite harmful. Something like 80% of the tickets each drawing are purchased by 20% of the players. While I'll grant that you're at least smart about playing the lottery, it still boggles my mind that people say they find entertainment value from buying paper with numbers on it, and that losing money, any amount and willingly at that, can somehow equate to fun. Yes they also advertise that large sums of money from lotteries goes towards things like schools and city projects, but it's been found that a good chunk of it really doesn't, and besides that, why would we want to fund things with what's essentially gambling?

I can buy a fair bit of actual entertainment that can do so much more for me in far better ways than the most literal sense of fantasizing about hitting it big. Sure it's a small amount, but I'd rather spend my money on something worthwhile that I can actually enjoy over chasing one of the most improbable things ever on a regular basis, because at the end of tonight's drawing there will be millions of people who have nothing to show for it other than discarded slips of paper.

I know, I know, it's my opinion and people are entitled to do what they want with their money, and I suppose that's true, but it also doesn't stop me from pointing out how utterly absurd it is and that there are plenty of uses for that money that are actually worthwhile.

"Bailout Timeline: Another Day, Another Bailout
In September 2008, the mounting subprime crisis finally burst into a full-blown financial crisis, leading to the collapse of a number of major financial institutions. In response, the Treasury Department has deployed hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars.

To shore up the collapsing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Treasury placed them under conservatorship. Soon after, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 provided the Treasury Department with $700 billion to shore up the broader financial system.

Below is a chronology of major events in the bailouts' lives. It will grow longer as major events continue to occur.

""the kingdom has come under intense scrutiny for its approach to the threat. Many of its Western allies have accused it of not doing enough to thwart the Islamic State’s funding sources or combat its ideology.
Analysts say Riyadh has been pursuing a risky dual strategy. It has supported extremist groups abroad for ideological and strategic reasons – not least to combat Shi’ite influence – while cracking down on extremists at home as a threat to the regime’s stability.
In a 2009 memo revealed by WikiLeaks, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the kingdom was a main source of funding for militant groups including Al-Qaida. Riyadh was not acting to stop this money flow, she added.
This policy continued into the Syrian civil war. Private sources in the Gulf provided hefty funding for extremist anti-regime groups in the uprising's early years, often channeling cash donations through intermediaries in Turkey.
Gulf states including Saudi Arabia allowed the transfer of funds to these militant Sunni groups, viewing the militias as an effective way to counter Iranian influence in the region.
Some groups funded this way later defected to the Islamic State, bringing their weapons with them. The Nusra Front is estimated to have lost around 3,000 fighters to its bitter rival ISIS""",2

"Here is my perspective, in the Democratic party - Obama is truly a moderate and I think the GOP missed an opportunity for the last 6 years to pass moderate legislation. 

In 2008 Obama ran a somewhat liberal campaign but not as left as Sanders. He took office and promptly shifted right. 

Nevertheless, the ilk of Fox News still called him a unamerican socialist, commie  out to destroy us. That is a bunch of bullshit and has been since day one. The one thing Obama has prepared us for is how far the GOP will go to bite its own foot off to prove how much they dislike Obama. 

A lot of voters like myself who voted for Obama have been disappointed with Obama's shift to the right to appease the GOP and try to get votes from them. That just makes them move more to the right, dragging Obama with them. 

Now that we have an authentic far left candidate (Sanders) running for office,  and he embraces everything the political right throws at him - Fox News will finally learn what a true socialist is.   The political right will explode when Bernie takes office, what are they gonna do - call him a socialist? He readily accepts that lol. 

Fox News will find that trying to attack Bernie with far left labels isnt going to hurt him. Also, Bernie wont be swayed to the right or to moderate his positions like Obama did which appeals to me. 

Edit: I also think Fox News will inadverntly help Sanders get elected, since they cant use far left labels to demonize him - they would only be able to use his platform/ideas to attack him with - but once people know about his policy positions it will get more people to vote for him. 

I imagine something like this:

"Money **does not** equal wealth.  Money is just the tool we use to ease bartering.  Wealth is a completely different concept.  You would benefit from a basic economics course, because you are not understanding some very basic concepts.

Money is supported by Wealth.  The United States Dollar is roughly equal to the **Value** of the **Wealth** supporting it divided by the number of USD currently in circulation.

**Value** is what someone is willing to pay for a product/good/service.

If I take a big lump of coal that has a certain fair market **Value** (Meaning what the market is willing to pay for coal)  and burn it to create electricity to sell for fair market **Value** (meaning what people are willing to pay me for electricity) and those two numbers are not equal, I have just created wealth.  

From that created wealth I now have to deduct what it cost me to create the electricity from the coal.  If it cost me more than the wealth created, I did not make a **Profit** 

The bolded worlds are all defined economic terms that mean specific things, not whatever you want to make them mean.

Now cronyism has definitely started becoming an issue.  Monopolies are definitely becoming far easier to obtain due to the modern globalization.  We have challenged ahead of us to attempt to solve this problem, however you are suggesting we merely burn the entire system to the ground and starve.  

Ownership of the product of ones own labor is a basic tenet that the unions fought for.  

You are saying that at a certain point, merely because I am wildly successful and make 'too much' money, I suddenly lose that right.  That's not how rights work.  If I can sell my labor to a company, then the owner of that company can keep everything that company makes just the same.  Just because his profit is 1000x of mine, doesn't mean it's not that same thing.

"&gt;  Glass Steigal (spelling?) 

Close enough. 

Glass–Steagall Legislation 

&gt; The term Glass–Steagall Act usually refers to four provisions of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933 that limited commercial bank securities, activities, and affiliations within commercial banks and securities firms.[1] Congressional efforts to ""repeal the Glass–Steagall Act"" referred to those four provisions (and then usually to only the two provisions that restricted affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms [2]). Those efforts culminated in the 1999 Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), which repealed the two provisions restricting affiliations between banks and securities firms.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Legislation

i looked up the GLBA as well. 

&gt; The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 and commonly pronounced ″glibba″, (Pub.L. 106–102, 113 Stat. 1338, enacted November 12, 1999) is an act of the 106th United States Congress (1999–2001). It repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, removing barriers in the market among banking companies, securities companies and insurance companies that prohibited any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment bank, a commercial bank, and an insurance company. With the bipartisan passage of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, commercial banks, investment banks, securities firms, and insurance companies were allowed to consolidate. Furthermore, it failed to give to the SEC or any other financial regulatory agency the authority to regulate large investment bank holding companies.[1] The legislation was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley_Act

Especially look at the controversy section: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley_Act#Controversy

&gt; Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has also argued that the Act helped to create the crisis. 

&gt; Bill Clinton, as well as economists Brad DeLong and Tyler Cowen have all argued that the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act softened the impact of the crisis.

&gt;Last month's **U.S. airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders medical compound in Afghanistan appeared precisely focused on the main hospital building**, the charity said in its internal review of the strike released Thursday, noting that the building's GPS coordinates had been provided earlier to the military.

&gt;**Doctors Without Borders staff also reported seeing people shot from the air as they ran between buildings** during the hourlong attack October 3 in Kunduz, it said. The charity said at least 30 people -- including 13 staff -- died during the early-morning strike.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/world/asia/doctors-without-borders-seeks-explanation-for-kunduz-hospital-attack.html

&gt;The Doctors Without Borders hospital was among the most brightly lit buildings in Kunduz on the night a circling American gunship destroyed it.

&gt;The rest of the northern Afghan city was mostly dark after days of fighting between the security forces and Taliban militants. **But the hospital was keeping its lights on as doctors there were working, according to the group’s general director**, Christopher Stokes.

Shooting at Doctors Without Borders volunteers while they run between buildings running for their lives sure sounds ""accidental"" to me. Obama has killed more Doctors Without Borders volunteers than Ebola, but Ebola isn't accidental right?

The argument that they get less productive with more than that is asinine.  They get less productive after 30 hours too.  And after 25.  You get tired when you work more.  If you're a go getter trying to improve your situation, or are a young person just starting out, there's no reason not to work 45-50 hours or so week.  I think anything more than 60 is far too much though.  And you act like 40 hours is some sort of sacred cap that society needs to preserve.  It's an arbitrary number that was standardized in the 50's when the 9-5 workday became the norm.  Granted i'm a student (who hasn't put in as little as 50 hours a week into my schoolwork/extra curriculars since like 7th grade) and i have no phobia of exceeding 40 hours per when i start working, and frankly look down upon any one who does.

I think there should be a safety net too.  Everyone deserves a second chance.  Everyone deserves a third chance too, but (and keep in mind this is a pretty pointless debate being that its more hypothetical semantics than anything else) i think there should be a drop off point where society stops propping up bums who have made no legitimate effort improve their situation.  And it would be more of a national disgrace to continue to support them with tax payer money than to just kick em to the curb.

"&gt;and commanding respect in a presidential manner

No one said that. Definitely not that. It was a hit segment. It was petty. I also, personally, don't agree with her main premise of hitting Bernie. 

Her beef is that Bernie voted against the bill that held gun lobbyists responsible for the people who use them. Her logic is if you buy a toy that kills someone we'd hold the toy manufacturer responsible. The glaring issue with her logic is that if a gun misfired and killed someone they have absolutely **no** protection against that type of lawsuit. She's claiming that when lunatics kill people with guns it's like the gun...malfunctioned? It's a shitty argument that doesn't make any god damn sense. It'd be like suing Milton Bradley if I beat the shit out of someone with the plastic shell of a battleship game.

If I took my car and fucking murdered someone with it that's not Chrysler's fault. At all. They're not getting sued. No one is even considering that. This is the logic Clinton's using, though. People that manufacture guns that kill people are...irresponsible?

Yeah. So this is her beef, and it's just bad. The logic is bad and it's petty. It's not presidential. She's an asshole, and you'll say ""all politicians"" are assholes. Bernie isn't. All he has to do is stay the course and all she can do is mount really weak arguments like the one on ""hardball.""

By the way, my entire point about the segment is that Chris Matthews *gave* her like 5 minutes to talk. It wasn't an interview. It was a speech. He just said ""yeah?"" ""really?"" ""go on?"" That's not really the type of debate that the electorate needs to be informed.",5

"The marginal tax increases are here: 

https://berniesanders.com/issues/medicare-for-all/ 

The plan is towards the bottom.  It will save them money as long as they negotiate with their employers unless your household makes more than 2million dollars.  Because the private sector will always take a cut from the top, if this happened, the private sector would become the public sector (think of what would happen to all schools if they all private, then they shifted to being public. All the teachers would be in the same positions.  Same thing would happen in the insurance industry. Its just the mentality of the people at the top would change from pleasing shareholders to pleasing citizens).  No, you would not be able to not pay the tax. You would still be responsible for the 2.2% and the increase on income tax (if you make enough to be affected by the income tax shift) but you could add on (so to speak) by paying a private company (same concept as the schools.  Just because you pay to send your kids to private school does not mean you get to opt out of your social responsibility for others in your community). How much more in taxes depends on how much you make currently and how much your company will increase your wages based on how much they save by no longer having to pay for employer group policies. No you can't opt out anymore than you can opt out of public school taxes just because you no longer go to school. 

As for if the government can handle it, again, the government agency that would replace private healthcare would be replaced by the people already working at the private health insurance companies. Their boss would just change the shareholders to the citizens who pay taxes. As far as the system failing, it would be doubtful that it would fail for the simple fact that the people running the insurance would be the people already running it. The only difference would be profit margins wouldn't be important.  Those margins would be returned to individuals who have the policies.

"If the left was wrong about Free Trade as you're claiming, the U.S. would be able to show a single year of trade surpluses since it was implemented.  As irrefutable evidence goes, the nation's balance of trade is as nonpartisan and objective as it gets when it comes to determining whether Free Trade has worked or not.  It hasn't worked.  [Click on ""max"" in this citation to see just how wrong Free Traders have been since that policy was first implemented in the mid-80's.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/balance-of-trade)  (Note:  Trade deficits began manifesting in the mid-70's after Nixon eased trade relations with China and recent improvements are the result of fracking which is in the process of dying.)

That's just one objective measure to point to in the U.S.  The loss of millions of U.S. jobs without viable substitutes, rise of the Rust Belt, growing national debt, deterioration of the economic climate for small business, poor consumer spending levels and a number of other objective measures also substantiate that Free Trade hasn't worked for the U.S.  In contrast, when one asks Conservatives to substantiate their Free Trade positions, they often respond with unsubstantiated theoretical musings, ""look who agrees with my position"" arguments (from supply side centric organizations and economists who fought to put Free Trade in place) and misleading push polls from the University of Chicago (supply side economics central).  If Conservatives could provide verifiable evidence that Free Trade has resulted in U.S. trade surpluses or widespread economic benefits that the cost of living and widespread incomes have changed in meaningful ways, that would be a different matter, but they can't.  By all means, make that effort.  I'd love to see evidence I have yet to encounter in working with this subject matter over several decades.  [*P.S.  We know that trade with China is the lion's share of the reason for most of the economic deterioration in the U.S. because that has been proven beyond all shadow of doubt by economists.*](http://faculty.som.yale.edu/peterschott/files/research/papers/pierce_schott_pntr_512.pdf)  NAFTA and U.S.-Mexico trade relations are the other major reason.

By the way, current U.S. and Chinese stock market convulsions are a direct expression of the mortal flaws inherent in Free Trade (i.e., it has choked U.S. and developed world consumer spending and that has, in turn, choked the demand for global products resulting in the predictable long-term downturn those ""leftists"" have been warning would happen).

Since you brought up the minimum wage, it does need to rise.  That's based on the U.S. cost of living, NOT what uninformed people think it should be based upon  (i.e., their personal feelings on the matter).  The minimum wage debate is being used to distract people from the more pressing need to raise middle class income levels.  I don't expect supply side myopic Conservatives to get this, but the issue hinges on restoring far healthier consumer spending levels/demand AND meaningful jobs in the U.S.  Conservative efforts over the past 40+ years have only succeeded in suppressing the labor market and income levels to the point of economic suicide.  As much as the business community would love to raise price/profit levels to the sky, it's a fool's pursuit when it's attempted simultaneously with widespread wage/income suppression and job destruction.  Why?  Sound economic practice requires robust aggregate supply AND demand levels.  The country doesn't need to focus on supply elements simply because that's not where the economic problems reside and they haven't for decades.  Conservatives are called supply siders simply because they ignore the demand side of economics to their own detriment.  This has always been their mortal economic and ideological flaw.  It's why the stock market has largely underperformed when they are in control of the public sector.

You want to talk about corporate taxes?  No problem.  It takes organizational revenue to enjoy a functional private AND public sector in society.  Without a financially viable public sector, the economic infrastructure it both creates and makes available to the private sector would not exist because the private sector would not create most of it.  In order to ensure the public sector and that infrastructure are available, the public sector must have the sufficient tax revenues to function effectively.  How does one obtain proper funding?  By ensuring that the tax structure is as progressively structured as the national distribution of income and wealth.  Absent that, sufficent revenues are not attained and it becomes dysfunctional.  The same consequence would be true for corporations if they failed to cover their operating expenses sufficiently. The simple fact is that the U.S. public sector would never be able to garner the financial resources it needs to function effectively by embracing the tax path corporations and Conservatives favor.  Ronald Reagan and Republicans have already proven that the tax path you all favor is tragically flawed.  It's why right wing fiscal policies restored Depression-era national debt levels.  Here, [see that nonpartisan evidence in all that history of fiscal disgrace](http://zfacts.com/p/318.html). Growing national debt results from the mortal math flaws in Conservative fiscal dogma and making the national tax structure less progessive than the distribution of national income and wealth.

Most economists are not the fiscal experts they should be.  If they were, they would not be making those lame efficency arguments.  Given that you have parroted the efficiency meme (often quoted by Friedman fanboys), it's a sure bet that the economists involved here are the same supply side-centric ideologues who have been wreaking global economic havoc for decades.  That's not wise in the least.

As I've just revealed here, Progressives are actually championing centrist economic and fiscal policy positions, not left wing positions because they favor a *balanced* approach to economics and fiscal policy, not the ""soak the rich"" approach they are often accused of pursuing.  Unlike yourself, I've actually look at the objective evidence and trends involved here rather than relying on the often flawed opinions and unsubstantiated theoretical musings of some prominent economists on the matters at hand.  You should do the same thing.  There are good and reliable economists in the economic community, but it doesn't appear that you have found them based on your policy positions, the economists you mistake for reliable arbiters and the basis for their positions.",0

I agree that we could lower defense spending, but we unequivocally need to increase health and infrastructure spending.As far as the suggestion of double taxation, it doesn't exist to the extent that you claim. Payroll is deductable. If a small business makes $150,000 a year and pays one employee $40,000 a year, that $40,000 is tax deductible. And that employee has to pay property taxes and sales taxes, but those taxes are also tax deductible. So you never pay tax twice on the same income. That's why effective tax rates are lower than marginal rates. The highest marginal tax rate in 1979 was 70%, but the effective rate was only 35%.

Yes, taking from the rich to pay for poor people's college would make poor people happier, but that would intrude on the rich's happiness (Obviously you have to intrude on everyone's happiness somewhat to pay for essentials like roads, military etc, that is a given).  They are citizens too.  College is not essential.

Poor people are free to pursue happiness in the form of higher education.  The government is not stopping them from doing so.  But the government has caused the rise in tuition for Universities.

Here's a quote/idea from u/sl600rt which I felt deserved a guilding.

""I got a crazy idea. 

We remove government from the student loan business and let people default on student loans. 

The market should correct it self. As now there is risk involved in loaning money. so Tiffany can get her Gender Studies degree. 

Fewer people will get loans and those that do will be ones that have great grades and test scores. Those that have an idea about which degree they want and have picked one that will most likely lead to getting paid off on time. Fewer loan bucks floating around means colleges have to lower prices to keep attendance up, or shrink to cut costs.

Poor students that work hard and are smart will still get scholarships and grants. 

Everyone that gets a degree will have a degree worth more because fewer degrees are being acquired. So they can actually land that better paying job and pay the loans off. 

Mediocre students will have to go to trade schools or straight to the work force. ""

The less the government is involved in non essentials, the better.  The government cannot magically make things free.  They have to take from somewhere.  If that service is not essential, the government should have nothing to do with it.",1

"I've read the actual study instead of the washington post hit piece.

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2443681

Here's your summary findings:

&gt;Across the basic seven Index I crime categories, the strongest evidence of a statistically significant effect would be for aggravated assault, with 11 of 28 estimates suggesting that RTC laws increase this crime at the .10 confidence level. An omitted variable bias test on our preferred Table 8a results suggests that our estimated 8 percent increase in aggravated assaults from RTC laws may understate the true harmful impact of RTC laws on aggravated assault, which may explain why this finding is only significant at the .10 level in many of our models. Our analysis of the year-by-year impact of RTC laws also suggests that RTC laws increase aggravated assaults. Our analysis of admittedly imperfect gun aggravated assaults provides suggestive evidence that RTC laws may be associated with large increases in this crime, perhaps increasing such gun assaults by almost 33 percent. 

&gt;In addition to aggravated assault, the most plausible state models conducted over the entire 1979-2010 period provide evidence that RTC laws increase rape and robbery (but usually only at the .10 level). In contrast, for the period from 1999-2010 (which seeks to remove the confounding influence of the crack cocaine epidemic), the preferred state model (for those who accept the Wolfers proposition that one should not control for state trends) yields statistically significant evidence for only one crime – suggesting that RTC laws increase the rate of murder at the .05 significance level. 

In my opinion, they aren't proving that more guns equals more crime as stated by the washington post. Their stated goal is to study impacts to areas with RTC (Right To Carry) laws, not gun ownership.  Secondly, their highest found signifigance level in their testing is .1, which doesn't exactly promote anything reported in the washington post hit piece.

Wind/solar are basically unrealiable sources of intermediate power that spend a lot of time shut off from the grid to maintain stability unless you happen to live somewhere like Denmark where it is constantly windy or the equator where it's constantly sunny.

Any good power engineer wants a variety of sources, that much is true at least, but you need to read up on how the power grid works before saying that we can do without nuclear.

Hell, nuclear is safe anyway.  Anyone worried about it is just buying into sensationalism.  If you wanted safer nuclear, give them more money to maintain/upgrade reactors, not less.",1

I feel like Hillary's poll numbers vs Republicans are at her floor as she has been attacked for a year nonstop. She represents a known quantity to me. I like her ability to kick ass in debates and to me, she would be an extension of Obama's presidency, which I am extremely in favor of.

&gt;That being said, there has been a lot of new stuff coming out that has made me  second guess all of this. Three things I'm looking at: Can Sanders outperform his poll numbers in Iowa and prove he can turn people out? Can Sanders poll numbers vs Republicans hold up now that he will be the primary recipients of attacks? Can Sanders conclusively perform so well in a debate that he wins a randomized post debate poll?

Did the BLM movement ever bomb lynch or kill anyone? Because I can name a certain group (*kkk cough*) who has done that for 200 years yet we never called them a terrorist group. I wonder why? Also the vandalism actions by a few does not represent a movement as a whole. If it did, then we might as well call the GOP terrorist to because of the planned parenthood boming? Or how about that nice fellow Dylan Roof who killed 9 black people and wanted to start a race war. Stop trying to demonize black people. It's not working. 

How about you actually do some research and ask yourself why are they protesting in the first place? What problems exist within the black communities? Because there are multiple problems that exist other than just unemployment such as food deserts and structural racism (it exists and Trump hasn't recognized it yet). 

Bernie Sanders is just starting to get his name recognized within the black community with the help of Dr. Cornell West. He recognizes the multiple problems that exist within black communities, not just the one that Donald likes to focus on.

"&gt; I believe there would be, not just from a law enforcement perspective, but form a media's

How did the media and law enforcement react when black people in Baltimore practically burnt down the city because they were unhappy about the judicial process?

Did the police start shooting people at random that were rioting and looting? I mean, they WERE black after all so it would totally be justified, right?

Oh wait, turns out race doesn't matter. What matters is perceived threat. 100 armed ranchers but they're not shooting at anybody and also aren't even physically able to cause other people problems due to their extreme geographic isolation? Yup, no reason to shoot them. A bunch of black people destroying property and looting buildings? Nope, don't (and didn't) shoot them either because no one's life is at risk. 

But to compare mass demonstrations like either of those to something like a traffic stop is insane and wrong. Officers treat everyone suspiciously in a traffic stop except probably little old ladies, because all it takes is a split second and the officer's lying on the ground bleeding out while the driver speeds away.

In both the Bundy case and the Baltimore case there wasn't increased tensions because anybody could die any second. So in both cases it was/is reasonable to wait it out and be peaceful. 

But if you're conducting a traffic stop or talking to someone on the side of the road and they reach for something you've got 1/4 of a second until you find out what it is and if it's a gun you've got another 1/4 of a second before you're gonna get shot. So police have to react fast and decisively. And I'll say it again. In a case like Baltimore or Bundy there isn't the danger of anyone dying in a split second, partly because both groups are so big that there's an added incentive not to start a firefight. 1 suspect and 1 officer? If the suspect wants to kill the officer he's got better odds of doing it successfully and getting away. 100 suspects and 100-1000 officers? Nobody in the bundy group wants to start shit because they know it'll turn into a bloodbath and by firing the first shot they've sealed the fate of all those around them.",1

The status quo is the Democrats losing races everywhere except the white house. Also this isn't just an online/reddit thing. Bernie has over a million individual contributors, of which only ~40k have come from reddit.

"They didn't drop a bunker busting bomb. They dropped the equivalent of 2 sticks of dynamite and some C4 onto a fortified rooftop bunker, barely enough to cause damage to any surrounding buildings. The only reason things got so out of hand was shortly after the bombs detonated a fire started but firefighters were ordered not to try to put it out because it was feared the MOVE members would open fire on the firefighters if they came out into the open to fight the fire.

Hell if I were one of those firefighters I wouldn't have gone to fight the fire even IF I was ordered to. That shit isn't worth getting shot over.

And the alternative was to just walk away from a police shootout and say ""OK domestic terrorists, you win. We'll go home and let you get back to what you're doing. Sorry about coming here with a bunch of arrest warrants and trying to bring you all to justice. Also sorry for shooting at you guys after you started shooting at us. We totally deserved those shots fired for trying to lawfully arrest some of you.""

Or the 3rd option of storming a fortified building full of an unknown number of armed militants. That way both sides get to die instead of just the domestic terrorists! 

Starving them out wasn't an option at this point because they're literally in a townhouse in the middle of a densely populated urban area and have already opened fire on police.

These Bundy Militia guys haven't shot at anyone, they're miles away from anything vaguely resembling a town let alone a dense urban environment. And none of them were even wanted for any crimes before this happened whereas the MOVE group members were wanted for:  parole violations, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terrorist threats.

But let's just go ahead and totally ignore all of those massive differences and say it's because they were black.",1

Gotta regulate that terrorist communication dontchaknow. So they've taken my guns and your internet. What else causes violence? Free speech can be used to incite violence. 

We should just put some reasonable, sensible, *responsible* regulations in place to prevent those silly willy free speechers from inciting violence with their pesky free speech. But... You know... Strangely enough... Since we did that the violence is still happening. Less so, now that everyone is super duper *SAFE*. I wouldn't worry about liberty. Safety is more important. No, now everyone is safe... But people are still violent :\

We took their mass murder machines known as firearms... We took that pesky Internet, we've got regulations on free speech... Wait! I know! That's it! We'll take free speech away entirely!!!

"Psychological exercises? Really? Gtfo with this condescending nonsense. (I don't mean to be rude, but saying that to someone with a chronic painful disease is incredibly insulting, and I hope you don't do it again in the future.) I'm guessing you don't have any personal experience a severely painful disease if you're saying something like that. 

If the problems are psychological, sure. But that is not what I'm talking about at all. Conditions that cause chronic physical pain are not psychological. There are many lifelong conditions that you cannot wish away. But the long term psychological effects of nonstop, untreated pain are quite severe.

If a non-narcotic drug can treat the issue, that's great. But again, not what I'm talking about. For some types of pain, anti-inflammatory drugs don't do anything (except tear up the liver).

I'm all for whatever treatment works. I just hate to see people who's lives are hard enough already caught up in the dragnet of this drug war BS, and something that actually helps their quality of life being taken away or heavily restricted.

It is difficult but not impossible for sociopaths to form attachments with others. Many sociopaths are able to form an attachment to a particular individual or group, although they have no regard for society in general or its rules. In the eyes of others, sociopaths will appear to be very disturbed. Any crimes committed by a sociopath, including murder, will tend to be haphazard, disorganized and spontaneous rather than planned.""

[But there is a lot of hate from virtually every other group](http://www.pollingreport.com/hrc.htm) (from self-identifying liberals through to left-wing independents, let alone the Republicans). [She is really only polling well among moderates within the Democratic base](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/hillary-clintons-poll-numbers-signal-trouble-ahead-118567). [Her numbers are frighteningly low overall, and her trustworthiness rating is broadly abysmal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/02/National-Politics/Polling/question_15680.xml?uuid=kJXdsAkVEeWVHo4VCQ1krg#) (49% unfavorable versus 45% favorable, with the skew more strongly in the hate category).

Now you might assume left-leaning independents are a small number of the overall voting population. But self-identifying independents are at record numbers (hovering around 40% of all voters). And the growing numbers are coming at the expense of both major political parties. Given this, I don't think it is dishonest for people to suggest Hillary is unpopular among the left. But I DO accept your point nonetheless about Democrats. Clearly Hillary does enjoy a lot of support among that group. And in my personal opinion - despite how unpopular it will be on this sub - I think Hillary will be a more electable candidate than Bernie (for the reasons I have given earlier e.g despite that hate, left-wing voters will pick Hillary over Trump).

is two old versions worth seeing too, but thats the one currently in effect.  

Worth noting that the undersecretary also has the authority.   and under that language, the secretary and undersecretary are who someone in the state department would go to if someone believed there was an classification error (either to lower or raise classification level) or to get authority for someone to view it!

They say even if we can just stop one it would be worth it. Why doesn't the same go for concealed carry on campus and other places?

"&gt;People are already paying for healthcare. If there is true universal healthcare, this cost disappears and is replaced by the cost of universal healthcare. You can't just say what it will cost without adding what it will save. Furthermore, universal healthcare costs less than other forms.

The problem is a distinction between total spending and government spending.  Even if we accept that universal healthcare is more cost effective (it *is*, though some of the estimates massively overstate the benefits we can achieve without rationing care), it is still a significant increase in overall government spending.

Now, you'll say ""well that's fine since you can increase taxes to get the cost of universal healthcare and it will still cost less than people are paying now.""

Except that in the private sector the lion's share of healthcare costs do not fall on employees, but rather on employers.  Without a way to capture the savings for employers as tax revenue, or somehow guarantee that those savings are passed on to employees, what will end up happening is raising costs for employees (i.e. the ordinary, average, Americans Bernie bangs on about helping) and lowering costs for employers (those rich bastards).

So saying ""it will save $3.2 trillion in *total spending*, while costing $1.5 trillion in *government spending*"" is not so much untrue as incomplete.",1

They were all strangers whom McDuff abducted after noticing Sullivan; she was repeatedly raped before having her neck broken with a broomstick.** McDuff was given three death sentences and subsequently convicted of having offered a bribe to a member of the parole board. He was freed in 1989. He was given a new death sentence and executed for a murder committed after his release and is suspected to have been responsible for many other killings.

It does allow though the VP and a majority of the cabinet to relieve him if he is unable to discharge the office, which would work unless the VP is in on it.

Otherwise I think Congress would have to impeach and convict him.  Possibly that could be tricky, because the constitution only empowers them to do it for ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors"", which it's not clear he will have committed.

"He's already won. He's made his opponents look like midgets and FOX look petulant, exactly as he intended. The hope that Trump is going to suffer from this latest controversy is wishful thinking at best. This is a political masterstroke and a very strong indication of his knowledge of how the media works, regardless of your feelings about Trump. Trump has Iowa in the bag-he's making short work of Cruz right now. This is a sign of strength to alienated, downriver white Americans, not all of whom are committed Republicans. They don't give a crap about FOX. This is especially the case in the Rust Belt, where The Donald's anti-free trade/illegal immigration message is very potent. Trump is doing very strongly among non-voters and a certain kind of Democrat who last voted Republican in 1988 for a reason.

He'll double his earnings from this ""gamble"" if he can set up an exclusive interview with CNN or something while the debate is going on. Not only he'll attract anyone who could remotely be for him but are out of the post-Clinton Republican focus, there's the contrast with the debate. The rest of the candidate pool will not only attack him when he's not there, but debate policy proposals (more corporate welfare and neoconservativism) that are in part directly responsible for the rise of Trumpism.

They’ve guaranteed that manufacturers enjoy virtual immunity from lawsuits, which means that they can sell lethal products and rarely face consequences.

My understanding, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong, is that poorer communities that can least afford to be paying these ATM fees are the ones most often paying them due to a lack of physical banks in their area where they can make an in person withdrawal.
    
The issue is worsened by the fact that these people are generally withdrawing very small amounts of money, let's say $40-$60 as a guess, and paying $8 on average in ATM fees (the national average) which means they're paying up to 20% fees for the money they withdraw. Unfortunately when you're poor you don't have the option of reducing that percentage by taking out let's say $400 instead at which point that $8 fee is 2%, as opposed to 20% of the total value.

* Hillary Clinton is a hopelessly inadequate politician, just like Obama

* Donald Trump is the straight-talkin' businessman-politician the country needs

* Donald Trump is a dangerous clown and a terrible businessman

&gt; Sort of.
And let's be honest, the government has given small businesses a bunch of advantages over big business. Such as the Fed MW exemption and ACA exemption.

Yes they have done a lot for small businesses, but the foundation of capitalism is fair competition. If you need poof of how competition fuels progress take a look at what SpaceX has done to space travel. Fair competition makes products cheaper, better, and makes America thrive. As long as companies are too big to compete with America will stagnate.

&gt; That doesn't seem to follow at all. Big lenders can make loans just like small lenders can. And sometimes small lenders are getting loans from big lenders.

This is where inequality comes to play. I'm not saying there shouldn't be different sizes of lenders. I'm saying there shouldn't be lenders that are SO big they have the power to affect the economy of the entire planet. There needs to be more balance. 

&gt; It isn't going to happen. I mean you might get some separation of powers like with GS (though I'd be honestly surprised if he could even get it reinstated.
And it isn't clear that it is a good thing either. Breaking up big banks would kick the economy in the nuts, so to speak. I agree that there is such a thing a ""too big to fail"" but there's also some middle ground with what action you take to fix that.

Not with that attitude mister. [Straight off of Bernie's website](https://berniesanders.com/issues/reforming-wall-street/) It's a very complex issue and I don't expect it to be as simple as smashing the banks into smaller pieces. It should take time and make sure we don't fuck the economy in the process. We can break them up responsibly and over a period of time. Not overnight. ",-1

Telling people to work hard and try to present a good image is not a problem:  acting like this alone would fix all the problems ""mislabeled as racist"" is a problem.  RZA didn't do that, but a lot of others are acting like he did.

"&gt;So if a president wanted to impose rules for other rights enumerated in the US Constitution, that would not be unconstitutional either? 

This happens *literally all the time*. There are many laws surrounding our rights, and most of them provide specific criteria and allow the executive branch to make rules within those limits, just like this. The Congress has already passed a law allowing the executive branch to reject a background check to purchase a weapon from anyone who fails the criteria. The Supreme Court has already rejected many imposed criteria for voting, but many jurisdictions in fact enact regulations on who can vote and what's required to do so; if someone feels that these regulations *do* violate the Constitution, they may bring suit - and, perhaps, if the SCOTUS agrees, win! 

The fact is that the law *allows* the ATF to determine what constitutes a ""business"" in this sense of the word, and to regulate NFA Trusts in regard to background checks. Those are the only two things he did that even matter. The rest is all ""Well, the NICS is slow, so we'll hire more ATF guys to work there"" and ""We'll call the states and ask them to participate in NICS in a timely fashion""... LOL

I repeat, Obama did not *change a single law*, nor *supersede a law*, he only specified *how* the ATF would comply with the law. You can go read these laws yourself, in fact. 

A Constitutional challenge is unlikely to be successful as nothing he's done keeps you from obtaining arms. It doesn't even make it materially harder for *any* citizen that can legally obtain arms from doing so. It merely regulates people who trade in arms as a business. ",3

"&gt;Exactly what? I didn't say anything about her deleting her personal emails.

You said

""shielded them from subpoenas, **FOIA requests, and being archived by the NARA (National Archives and Records Administration).**

To which I replied with

&gt;DOJ is saying that she complied with FOIA and NARA see brief: https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2401598/state-objections.pdf

Then you said

&gt;That's in regards as to whether or not she was allowed to delete emails that didn't pertain to her work. 

You are the ones who bought up deletion - NOT ME.

You bought up FOIA and NARA, I showed that she complied, you started a tangent with the deletion point.

&gt;Pretending like I said congress is ""overseeing her email"" is disingenuous at best. Congress has oversight of the executive branch. The official communications are supposed to be preserved as part of the agency records.

No they are not, agency records may be subpoenaed if there is a valid cause, there is no oversight over communication. There is a thing called executive privilege. NARA takes care of agency records, not Congress.

&gt;You might want to learn about the very basics of how the US government works.

You may want to read the DOJ brief, most emails are not even defined as records under NARA, if you have even once bothered with it, you won't be repeating this nonsense.

&gt;The requirements are obviously not enforced properly. 

There are no requirements because the Federal Records Act was changed in 2013 after both Clinton and Powell left - you can't enforce laws retroactively.

&gt; that is not the FBI saying what you're saying - Second, that was a press release from months ago (October) before this classified information was even discovered.

FBI said there is no investigation into her, it's called a counter inteliigence referral which is never criminal

&gt; Second, that was a press release from months ago (October) before this classified information was even discovered.

What 'this' classified information?

You do know you are literally talking about a NYTimes article that the Republican IG is trying to pretend is top secret right?

&gt;The information in the emails “was not obtained through a classified product, but is considered ‘per se’ classified” because it pertains to drones, the official added. The U.S. treats drone operations conducted by the CIA as classified, even though in a 2012 internet chat Presidential Barack Obama acknowledged U.S.-directed drone strikes in Pakistan.

&gt;&gt;One of those involved a drone strike, and the other was related to North Korea.

"This- I think the social media hostility comes in large part from talking past each other, and mutual fears of how high the stakes are.

Clinton's people are too dismissive of very real concern over her past actions, and how they bode for her independence. She had made bad calls, and I do think establishment types (people who are paid to do politics) are not really listening to the widespread hunger for a shift in the status quo. Many Dems don't want to settle for trench warfare with the GOP to gain inches on policy, they want to win.

Sanders people seem to be pretty dismissive of very real concerns about how his proposals get through Congress and are implemented. There are other issues to passing single payer than lobbyists- 31 States have GOP control (States have a lot of say over how Federal law is implemented) , and holding the legislative coalition together over the technical overhaul Medicare would need is a challenging feat. The fear Clinton people have is the policy failure would lead to disillusionment and a ""shellacking"" in 2018.

I hope both sides can listen to each other more. Clinton is not Republican lite, she is Democrat lite, and she would push for reforms. Sanders is not going to remake the American political system, but he is no loon- he is an intelligent and exceptional legislator who could operate DC if elected. Also- I believe Sanders is electable, but that him winning by a huge margin won't happen. Both camps basically want the same thing, but see a different battlefield with different possibilities in front of them. So lets come up with the best ideas we can, while electorally smashing the two racist demagogues leading the GOP pack.",14

Can you imagine what a boost to the economy it would be if recent college grads could spend their income on their house?  Pay off a car?  Disposable income is so important to our economy.

People say the same thing about healthcare.  ""Taxes are so high to pay for health care.""  People pay thousands a year on premiums, let alone how much more on bills if they actually get sick.  

Paid maternity leave? Yes, there is a minor tax increase of a dollar or two a week.  But you know what?  Developed countries know how important, and humane it is to let people stay home with their children the first months of their life.  Some even allow them to stay home the first YEAR of their life.

"The reason America has gone from a sparsely inhabited land of hunter gatherers and subsistence farmers into the world's richest and most powerful nation on earth in 300 years is because it was founded on Jeffersonian Democracy.

 Jeffersonian Democracy was crafted by enlightened philosophers who knew how monarchy's and rulers governed by force and oppressed the common man. The US founding fathers drafted a constitution that set out limits on government power and enshrined the power vested in the people. 

It was the first government in the world where the government ruled as servants of the people and not the other way around. 

Bernie Sanders is a self proclaimed socialist. Socialism takes power away from the people and places it all in the hands of the government. Communism theoretically places power into the community and the workers but that has never worked in the past. Under any socialist system, at best we can hope for is the state acting in proxy for the community or the workers. 

That means that under socialism, for all practical purposes, the people will be ruled by a group of self proclaimed elites.

Moving the country left as Sanders desires will take away personal freedom from the people. The capitalist, free market system that has given the US the highest living standards in the world will be regulated until it is effectively controlled by the government. Political correctness will further limit free speech until the people are afraid to speak out about anything. 

Sanders make a lot of promises but his plans simply can't be paid for by increasing taxes on the rich. His plans will require massive increases in taxes for everyone except the poorest members of society. Increasing taxes will decimate economic growth and seriously limit technological development.

Voters need to understand that socialism is not simply a friendly government spending more money and trying to make general improvements to the country.

Socialism is a rigid, static ideology designed to harm the most productive elements of society. As they say, socialism works until the system runs out of other people's money. 


As an Australian, you can't grasp the level of frustration the people in the US feel about government. Our leaders talk and make promises but in the end they only listen to big campaign contributors and lobbyists. Enough is enough. The system needs an outsider to smash the cozy inside game that is being played in DC. 

Donald Trump is the best candidate for the job. He understands that a free market, competitive economy will add jobs. He wants to put America first again and strive towards making us stronger. We must have a sane immigration policy. We must have a sane economy. We must eliminate political correctness. We must reestablish ourselves as the leader of the free world.

"Things are going to get more expensive, though.  A lot of people who don't have any money are suddenly going to have some money, so all the stuff they buy is going to get more expensive as demand rises.  And a lot of the places that sell those things are places currently paying people 8 bucks an hour, so they're going to pass those price increases on to the customer.   If you're making six figures, the price increase isn't going to be that noticeable.  If you're making fifteen grand a year, you're going to be making so much more than you used to that the price increase isn't super offensive.  But if you're making forty thousand you don't get a raise, and everything gets more expensive.

I personally would rather pay a bit more for a whopper knowing that the person selling me the whopper gets to go home to a house, with food and heat and maybe even some form of entertainment.

Fair.

&gt; Right and left both care about the poor; they just differ in their views on how that poverty should be alleviated.

The right (generally) thinks that poverty is the fault of the individual, and that people who are poor are in that position due to their own mistakes and nothing more. This is why they don't favor the government offering assistance to those families that fall on hard times. They (generally) think that those families are *right* to be suffering in poverty.

From http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2009/aug/10/religion-george-bush :

&gt; In the winter of 2003, when George Bush and Tony Blair were frantically gathering support for their planned invasion, Professor Thomas Römer, an Old Testament expert at the university of Lausanne, was rung up by the Protestant Federation of France. They asked him to supply them with a summary of the legends surrounding Gog and Magog and as the conversation progressed, he realised that this had originally come, from the highest reaches of the French government.
&gt;
&gt; President Jacques Chirac wanted to know what the hell President Bush had been on about in their last conversation. Bush had then said that when he looked at the Middle East, he saw ""Gog and Magog at work"" and the biblical prophecies unfolding. But who the hell were Gog and Magog? Neither Chirac nor his office had any idea. But they knew Bush was an evangelical Christian, so they asked the French Federation of Protestants, who in turn asked Professor Römer.

The Iraq war was always stupid. And apparently religous crazy on Bush's behalf played a role.",44

It was simply covered on Fox by someone much more familiar with Karl's case...

&gt;Williams turned to his fellow commentator, **Republican strategist and former Bush adviser  Karl Rove**, arguing that the email scandal during the Bush administration didn’t garner the same level of media criticism. Thus, the attention on Clinton is unwarranted.

&gt;""When Karl was in trouble back in ‘07, (there was) no press coverage, just about zero press coverage of this issue,"" Williams said, noting that he found just one Washington Post editorial criticizing the private email use.

Having an unlimited number of guns around is most certainly going to produce more dead people.

Suicide is almost always decided and executed in a short time, so having guns in the home, leads to an expedited success, where as someone who needs to plan an alternative, often results in a changed mind, or a cooling off. So it's really the opposite of what you say, more guns lead to more gun suicide. The priority should be, as it is here in Canada, is identifying mental health issues before suicide or mass shootings occur, but maybe the Americans are ahead of the curve here, and choose to let the firearms sort things out.  

Gun suicide is the main reason we have strict firearm laws here in Canada, and it shouldn't be considered collateral damage in the USA. ",1
