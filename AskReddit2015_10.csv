Population wont be much of a problem as things steadily decline. As things get worse so will food supply and disease and death. But with that also comes war and fighting. I think unless there's some sort of dramatic change... we will see these things in our lifetime. Humans are stubborn. We don't do well with change.

At some point it just seemed stupid. Science and history didn't agree with the stuff the rabbi was saying, god is supposed to be everywhere and all loving but fuck everyone who didn't live in a wealthy section of a well developed nation. Oh and everyone in general during the world wars. And I personally had a couple of really unfortunate mental and physical health issues that made life harder than it needed to be. Weird ones at that. Why did that exist at all? If there was some entity that was supposed to care about everyone and could fix anything, why didn't it? I was full blown atheist by 8, which I realize as a write this probably contributed to hebrew school starting around then. Got thrown out of hebrew school right quit however.

McDonald's -- a multi *billion* dollar company -- was trying to save a few dollars by keeping its coffee so hot that the poor woman had to spend 8 days in the hospital.  Punitive damages are meant to punish *and* to deter, yet $2m is barely a drop in the bucket for McDonald's.  The only reason I agree it was excessive is because the compensatory damages were way less, and SCOTUS has held that punitives can't be completely disconnected to the compensatory amounts. ",24

"I guess my story is a little different than a lot of people's on here.

I was eventually recruited to play lacrosse in college where I was a D/C student, then deciding it would be cool to be a lawyer I took the LSAT and passed with a really high score. I was contacted by quite a few schools and reached to some but a lot said my poor grades were a no go, so my senior year I got all A's which boosted my GPA enough to get me in. I then attended law school where I was once again a C/B student, but I made a lot of good connections. Now I'm graduated, in a completely different state with a cool job doing contracts and negotiations for a finance company making much  more than I thought I would. I've never posted my GPA to any résumé and no one's ever asked so it didn't really effective me other than making me get better grades for a year, once. ",1

"You're probably just going to get mad and call me stupid, but on the off chance you're genuinely interested I want to be clear that *I'm* not saying you're dumb or an evil bigot or anything like that. Just that there is a bit more depth to the issue than you may be taking into account.

First of all, you called homosexuality and transgenderism a mental illness. A mental illness *by definition* has to be something that negatively affects an individuals ability to function on a daily or near daily basis. It is *not* an illness.

Moving on from that, I'll assume you didn't mean it in such a negative way and go off of maybe you trying to talk about it is abnormal. In that case, you're missing the historical context of the world ""normal"", a term which was not used in a social setting until it was placed as a way to push eugenics in the early to mid 1800s. (Before that it was an engineering term simply to mean something was level.) 

""Normalcy"" doesn't actually exist in populations, it was developed as a way to promote an ""ideal person"" that doesn't actually exist. It's a warped way of viewing statistics in an attempt to rank people on a scale that historically rewarded the characteristics of the people pushing the research. ""Normal"" transitioned to ""ideal"" and ""abnormal"" turned to deviant.

Less common does not mean abnormal. Your assertion that being different is innately an illness is incredibly flawed from basically every reasonable discussion of biology, psychology, statistics, and philosophy.

Other than my grandfathers war mementos every other possible family heirloom had been sold or taken away with the garbage.  Thousands of dollars of items that my grandfather had accumulated were gone and all my grandmother got was $200 which my great-uncle claimed was ""every last penny"" he'd gotten for everything.  

When my great-uncle died a few years later no one had seen him because he'd pretty much been disowned by the family.  When they went through his house to pack everything up they found my grandfathers golf clubs, bagpipes, his gold cuff-links, his watch, and his accordion.

"I agree and disagree (and I work in teaching at the graduate level, for what it's worth). You're absolutely right, a huge part of the opportunity of college at top research universities is the opportunity to learn from true experts in their fields. No, they're not the best teachers (and I know many that don't take teaching seriously at all), but for a more apprenticeship-driven learning approach, it's a phenomenal opportunity.

That's why I emphasize transferring from a CC to a bigger university. Yes, learning from experts in their fields is very powerful when you're learning the advanced subjects. That freshman Calculus class with 300 people packed into one lecture hall? You don't need a world-class researcher for that. And yes, many schools hire dedicated instructors for those classes, but many don't -- and even for those that do, teaching those classes isn't at the top of the university's overall priority list.",0

"It's just this empty sucking vortex.  I'm sure it's somewhat different for different people but here's a couple of things I experienced that may illustrate it:

I was working out in a neighborhood gym I really liked about 3 times a week, frankly because I was trying to fight feeling depressed.  After a few months, I started not wanting to go, so I developed a strategy - I would tell myself that all I had to do was put on my workout clothes and then see how I felt...and I would feel like going, it was a good experience.  Then a week or two later putting on my workout clothes didn't help, so I'd go sit in my car and then I'd feel like going.  Then, that didn't work, so I'd tell myself, just drive there.  Then, it got down to just go in...and then even when I went in I just felt like I was making a dead body push weights and cycle.  The third time I drove there and couldn't make myself get out of the car, I just gave up and stopped renewing the membership.

So here I was doing something that helped the depression but the depression overtook it and killed it.  Sucky stuff.

I would make myself do things with people, even though I didn't want to because I thought it would help.  In the beginning, it did but as time went on and things went downhill, it actually made it worse.  I realized that unless I picked a time when I wasn't feeling too bad, making myself go out with people would be such a negative experience that it would make me even less likely to do it the next time.  So I started being afraid to do things with people, especially in a group and especially ""fun"" things for fear it would isolate me even further.

I guess the bottom line is, be gentle.  LISTEN to what they tell you and don't assume you know what's best for that particular person based on some article or anything you read here.  Realize they're going to have some bad days and may withdraw or even push you away at times.  Never underestimate the power of a simple text or a few words - if you think about them, let them know but respect their boundaries for anything more than that when they're having a bad time.

You rock for asking this - you have a lucky friend =)

"Torrid.

When I was in 8th grade, they held the our first formal dance at the end of the year. I was tall and busty and awkward and didn't fit into 'normal' clothes for my age.

After spending an entire weekend trying to find a dress with my mother, I broke down crying in a mall. I was heartbroken and thought I was ugly and doomed to wearing untrendy, old-lady clothes to my first dance (yes, I *am* aware of how much of a First World Problem that is but I was 13 so cut me some slack, yeah?)

A very...um, *large*...woman approached my mother and I and asked if we had ever been inside a Torrid. I hadn't because I had a prejudice against plus size stores,  but she took us to the one in the mall. 

They had tons of dresses for me to try on. I think I finally settled on something atrociously hot pink with skulls and polka dots on it. But I was treated as a human being, and a beautiful person, even though ever other store had made me feel awful with every practiced sneer of, ""You won't fit anything *here*.""

But Torrid made me feel beautiful. I was painfully self-conscious of my acne and my body and they helped me find something I loved without criticizing me. 

Of course, that was back when Torrid was a big girls Hot Topic. Now it's a fashion store, and I'm so glad that Torrid grew out of its awkward punk faze with me. 

I've been a loyal customer for 12 years, and I'll definitely keep going- I'm not an awkward 13 year old anymore, but I still love feeling beautiful.

"Make sure school always comes first. Make yourself focus and go to class. You're not missing anything at 9 am on a Tuesday that's worth skipping class over. Don't. Skip. Class. You learn so much more by being there than 'catching up on it later'.

Stay within your limits. If you know you can't get your ass out of bed to get to class if you go out the night before, then do something about it. Schedule later classes, or don't go out the night before. Set yourself up for success in advance, don't always try to be reactive to shitty situations you've put yourself in, like not starting a 20 page paper until the night before it's due. Make yourself write one page a day for a couple of weeks or whatever. 

One strategy a friend used was this: school was his job. 9am-5pm M-F, he was in school. He was either in class, studying, or doing school work during that time. After 5, the time was his to do whatever with. It mirrors the real world pretty well, and 40 hours a week is plenty of time to get everything done if you focus.",2

As for the UK, there is a rule for private drinking, which is that it is illegal to give any alcohol to a person under 5 years old.

"I came out of high school with a 2.2 GPA in the mid-90's. 

I went in the Army right after school, married my preggers 16 year old girl friend, and had my son 1 month after my 18th birthday. I did everything wrong, and I paid for it. Army life was hard, but I went for it, went through Ranger school and pushed through it to get promoted faster to make more money for my family. 

After the Army I got an entry level job in an IT department installing desktop computers. It was a 2 month long contract, but I was happy for the experience, I got permission to borrow some of the old desktops and setup up a lab in my 400 sq ft 1 bedroom apartment. During that time I self taught myself the basics and started self study to get my Microsoft certs. After the contract ended I got a new job working in an IT department. They sent me to some classes to get my Microsoft certs and paid me 32k a year, and I had my daughter. After a year, I was laid off, and got my first real IT job in a big company as an Administrator and I bought my first house. I was making 55k a year at this time. 

I worked here and there, and in 2000 got my first management job as an IT director for a small company. I hit 85k a year. Lasted for a while, until the company folded and couldn't find another job, so I started my own company doing IT consulting and contracting. After 3 years I broke the 200k a year mark, after 5 years 450k, and then in 2008 I went out of business and got divorced. I resumed work an independent IT consultant and started rebuilding my life.

I got remarried a few years later, and my Wife (Nurse practitioner) and I both earn @150k a year salary, plus we have residual income we make on investments etc. So we do really well for ourselves. 

I am 40 now, had a few health scares (it was nothing thankfully), and I am starting to feel my age creeping up on me. My wife and I have started to look more inward lately. Focus on physical fitness, and our future. So we have started to plan the details of our retirement. With my son is in his twenties and my daughter about to go to college. We are starting to look abroad, and we are shopping for a beach front home in the caribbean (Likely Costa Rica or Belize). We are on track to have our house in Texas paid off, our future house in the caribbean paid off, be debt free, and have enough savings in the bank to retire in @ 10 years when I am 50. 

Hopefully our life then will be living it up on our beach house, spending time together, traveling, and hopefully playing with some grand kids. 


I will say this... the past 21 years since high school have been a blur. 21 years. I still can't believe that 2005 was a full 10 years ago, that my kids are adults, that I am a middle aged man, and I am seriously talking about retirement; all in all I have had a crazy life so far. Done a lot of really great things, raised two great kids, lived a lot of life, and I am ready for the next 20 years.

"Now you're changing the topic from a very rigorously defined thing (a number system) to an abstract/unknown topic (fundamentals of the universe).

Trying to bring the question away from the abstract, in **your** definition of water, is its simplest form 1 molecule of H2O? If so, then yes, water is discretely countable.

However, we know that's not the case, we know that molecule is made up of atoms, which are made of something else, and on and on. Is our universe as we know it a fundamentally discrete system? Maybe. Maybe the 'building blocks' that make up everything get so small that it's physically impossible for us to know they exist.

You're changing it from rigorous defined facts (Money is a discretely countable system, y = mx + c is a continuous system), to a matter of opinion/philosophy (Is there something smaller than a quark? A string? If our universe is discrete, is anything truly continuous?)

"I know someone who believes a host of pseudo-religious, pseudo political garbage.  The conversation started with why the thought Obama should be impeached/assassinated, transitioned to why he was the Antichrist, and flowed seamlessly into him being in cahoots with Satan and radical Jews and Islamic people.  It turns out that a radical sect of Muslims and a radical sect of Jews have the Arc of the Covenant hidden under the Temple in Jerusalem, and are trying to find a way to unleash the power of God to secure the world for their lord Satan.  

When asked for biblical or real life evidence for their views, they sighted the time in the Bible when Moses and the 12 Disciples were marching into Jerusalem with the Arc (coincidentally, this did not happen).  The Arc was falling, Elijah reached out to steady it, and was struck down (Elijah was not a disciple, the arc was not carried into Jerusalem in his time, and he is one of the only characters not to have a recorded death in the Bible.  They also sighted their aunt and her opinions.  This woman was the parent of one of the kids in my youth group.  As a young youth pastor, I suggested she may want to spend more time studying the Bible than they do getting on government watch lists.",3

The first SOH is really easy, as you bend the top half of the deck that you're splitting and naturally see the card where you split it, if you just have the front of the deck angled down.  
The second SOH is a little more tricky, but with a new deck it's very easy because the cards slide more freely. You can practice that part just by holding a deck face down (you do this with one hand, holding the deck in an overhand fashion) and sliding the bottom card back about a half inch, using your ring finger. From the perspective of the audience, it's basically an invisible move. You can try it in front of a mirror until you're convinced you've got it.",2

My mom ragged on me for years for not going to university (I went to college out of high school which is different in Canada) so you'd think that when I went back to university she'd be happy. Nope. Overheard her going 'why would she think going back to school is a good idea??' And ragging on my major 'gogo thinks she can be a teacher?' (At the time I was interested in education) like it was the most vile thing ever.  She was literally cackling with her friend about this. I dunno what crawled up her butt about me wanting to be a teacher. I pointed out to her that overhearing this was super hurtful and her friend stood up for her and was all 'your mother is entitled to her opinions and blah blah blah' and something about respecting elders or something. What this friend doesn't realize is that turn the tables and bam she's the one being trash talked later that week. She has all these toad friends that just gossip and don't care if what they're saying is terrible. It's awful and it's one of the many things I work hard to make sure I haven't picked up from her.,1

Just because you wouldn't be one to turn down the opportunity doesn't make another person racist just because they do imo. Not everyone is like you, and just because they aren't doesn't mean they should feel obligated to do something they aren't willing to do.",18

"Probably no one will read this seeing how late I am to the party, but I thought I'd share my somewhat interesting one to show that it's not always love at first sight, but that doesn't mean it won't work out in the end.

I had recently been dumped by the girl of my dreams just mere weeks before I had planned on asking her to marry me. As a result, I had become bitter and started sleeping with every girl I could. 

I ended up making a profile on OKCupid to meet outside of town because my reputation was starting to go around the girls' dorms on campus.

One night, someone viewed my profile while I was online and OKC notified me, so I went to check her out. She was... interesting looking, to say the least. Not repulsive, but not my cup of tea. However, she looked like a really fun and genuinely nice person from the photos she had posted and I saw from her profile that we actually had a lot in common. On a whim, I decided to send her a message just to see what'd happen. She responded and we talked for a while.

A week later, it was Spring Break and I was back home. I was starting to get depressed without school and women to keep my mind occupied, so I shot her a message asking if she'd be up for driving to my town to see me. I don't know WHY I asked because she lived five hours away from my hometown. Nevertheless, she actually said yes!

She came to town around 11pm and we met at her motel. My first impression when she got out of her car was, ""Damn, this girl looks way too mature for me. We may have a lot in common, but I don't know how this will work.""

Boy, was I wrong. We went to the movies. We went roller skating. We drove to a town an hour away just to eat some Thai food. We had a blast. The second night, we were up until the early hours of the morning talking about life. I learned we had more in common there, too. She was going through a divorce and had made her profile to shut her friends up. See, her husband was in the military and a complete asshole. He had told her he no longer loved her and had cheated on her more times than he could count. I told her my story about my own heartbreak and she just started bawling because she felt worse for me than for herself. 

Next thing I know, we're kissing. Next next thing I know, she's on top of me and we're doing the beast with two backs. 

After she went home, she admitted that I was the only guy she'd been with besides her ex husband. I felt really guilty because she was a genuinely amazing person, so I didn't want to lead her on. I told her that we shouldn't have done what we did, but I was totally cool with being just friends. She wasn't happy, but she took it well.

One day, out of the blue, I decided that we should live together so that she could get out of her town/away from her ex's family and I could get out of the dorms and be a better person. Unbelievably, she said yes even though she barely knew me.

That was almost five years ago. We've lived together ever since, got married last year, and welcomed our daughter to the world exactly three months ago from today.

She was never the type of girl I was looking for. Her and the girl I had intended to marry couldn't be more opposite, but I couldn't care less. The longer I'm with her, the more in love with her I fall. I've never met someone with so much laughter in their heart, kindness in their soul, and childlike curiosity and wonder. Every day is an adventure for her and she's ecstatic that she has someone to share it with. I never knew someone could love me this much, but I'm glad I gave that geeky girl on OKC a chance.

**TL;DR Sometimes, doing things on a whim can lead to fascinating results.**",2

Since I was able to speak to people from many different countries, when there was a communication barrier with someone who spoke one of the languages I did, other staff would send them to me, and we'd speak in their mother tongue. The relief on their faces was always visible. I had a Russian man who didn't even know how to say ""Russian"" in English - He just shrugged and said ""Russki, Russki"" to other staff. It turned out he was visiting family and wanted to read some Russian language books, so I pointed him to our collection, he saw our Pushkin books, and beamed. As I said goodbye to him, I turned around, and a woman started speaking rapidfire Spanish at me. I don't speak it, but I understand a lot of what I hear, so I responded in a mix of Italian and Portuguese, which she also didn't speak, but understood. We sorted out her issues and I went upstairs, sat down at my desk, and felt my brain almost implode. Foreign languages are hard enough, jumping from one to another is even harder.

One day we sat down to eat and the potatoes tasted amazing. They were the nicest potatoes I'd ever eaten. I asked about them and it turns out Mum had had an epiphany and realised that we don't have to buy the shitty potatoes anymore. She bought a bag of (slightly) more expensive potatoes and the difference they made to the meal was astonishing.

tl;dr: potatoes. but you don't notice until you eat something better",3

"""People in &lt;third world country&gt; could have eaten that!""

No they couldn't. Me not eating my &lt;insert small food here&gt; isn't going to make any different whatsoever in some third-world-country where people are starving. Sure, they're starving, yes, it's terrible, but me not eating something small isn't going to change *anything*.",6

Serious question : why?,1
"It has to do with historically calling all foreigners devil peoples. This started way back, since at one point China was the only settled agricultural civilization in East Asia, so to those people all foreigners were literally savage barbarians. China was consistently surrounded by nomadic tribes since then that routinely attack them, leading to a generally xenophobic culture (that has had periods of alternating isolationism with imperialism, but maintaining that good ol' xenophobia). 

So by default, many dialects of Chinese use words that refer to all foreigners as devils, even if they don't always literally mean it. They just sometimes attach the world ""devils"" to the name of the country or place to mean the people of that country. You can also just use the general word for people in place of devil; it'll have the same meaning. ",2

My grandfather worked for the state and found 3 baby raccoons with a dead mom in the woods so he scooped them up and my grandparents  raised them.  They would lay on grandmother's lap like puppies and eat out of her hands.  They released them once they were old enough.  Damned if one of them didn't come back a couple years after they released them and still answered to the name they gave it and lived in their yard for a couple of weeks until it died. It was really weird like it came home to see its parents because it knew it was about to die.,4

The 4th we named Porridge because he was white and very thick.

One time I found him lying on his back in the grass just ineffectually pawing at the air as some birds flew by, hundreds of meters overhead.

Porridge was constantly distracted by his own shadow that was undoubtedly up to no good. He also couldn't eat from one side of the food dish. It was a normal, circular dish... but he just had never done it from that side before.

Sadly Porridge's stupidity was his undoing. He somehow climbed into a very thick hedge that was his tomb. We found his entangled corpse some time later... which might be my last childhood memory.",1

His best one was that Methylamine is not a real substance and was just invented by the Breaking Bad producers as a plot point. Everyone believed him, I was doubtful but didn't know for sure so I didn't challenge. Afterwards I googled it and yep, completely wrong. 

So I waited a few weeks then one day though I deliberately steered the conversation towards Breaking Bad when a lot of us were chatting, knowing he wouldn't be able to resist his fun fact. I discreetly steered him right towards it and then when he spurted his fact I jumped in with ""Um, methylamine is real.""

"I think pro-abstinence people really underestimate the effect of a poor sex life on a marriage. 

When I was attending a conservative university, I remember telling friends who asked about my virginity, ""if I'm really deeply in love, then the sex is going to be good, because it'll be a reflection of our love and commitment to each other"".

And then I actually had sex, at 20, and realized that someone you love can be really incompatible with you. These abstinence supporters also tend to be the type who have only had one partner themselves, and who haven't explored their own sexuality to figure out what they like in the bedroom. Vanilla.

I think certain subcultures in society really value it, but they are almost 100% religious ones. I would argue that most everyone else sees it as naivete. ",2
"Trust me when I say that if you get to the point where your bullshit is bad enough that a manager is going to ban you, everyone already knows who you are on sight.  You're ""that asshole who always complains"", and they all breathe a sigh of relief, and secretly hope that they are the one who gets to tell you to get the fuck out the next time you come back.

You can probably get away with a trip through the DT on the down-low, or go somewhere else, but the folks at that location will be on the lookout for you for at least the next few months, and there's a good chance that every store in the area at least has your description and as much info as they know about you.

Thinking about it though I think, I don't quite understand that usages of the word binary.  I can see how it might technically fit some meanings of that definition, but really when people say something is binary they mean it's one or the other, whereas you're using binary to mean a spectrum with 2 ends, as opposed to 3 (or more) set values or a spectrum between 3 or more values.

But in that sense dimmer switches for lights are binary?  Volume sliders are binary?  Generally binary is used to emphasise that there is no in-between, not that there are 2 ends.

The use of the word binary to describe a spectrum with 2 ends is not something I've ever seen before and I don't think it's what people generally mean by the word.

I understanding wanting to correct people who mistakenly think sex is ternary though, because it's not ternary either.  But in my mind it is incorrect to say it is binary, it's a spectrum between two values (and most people are at either end).",1
