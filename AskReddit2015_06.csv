"I'm not one to compliment the brits on things lightly. Cuz you know I don't want them getting big heads or anything. 

But goddamn if British intelligence operations wasnt unrivaled by a large margin during ww2. It was absolute mastery. The US and other allied countries had their own methods yes. But the British stood a tier above.

They had the Germans actively losing the war for them. 

That being said, one could argue that you could trace the single most significant contribution to counterintelligence to a Spanish man that simply took it upon himself to fuck the Germans. When he initially went to the allies to offer his services they ignored him. So he went and  did it on his own. The brits only reconsidered when they themselves were being fooled and picked up on it, seeing the potential of the man.

Overall though. One could argue that although it was the heroism of the fighting man that secured victory. It was the intelligence community of the allies that paved the way for their success. I firmly believe that operation overlord would have failed or faired significantly worse had the allies not invested so thoroughly in intelligence operations. ",2

Then the teacher asked how I was mean and harass them. Her response was ""because he always disagrees with us! He always says an alternative when we don't want to hear one!"" And of course this was our government teacher who loved to challenge people's ideas as well and said ""So what's the issue? He doesn't seem to be mean, and he never cusses are argues in any of his classes."" Then while they continue I asked my friend who had walked up to the door if they were talking about me.

I had never seen her laugh so hard and everyone was like ""ooooooh shit"". When they asked how long I had been out there I had said ""since I heard you say I used 'obscene language'"". And they did not say anything about me the rest of the class. They usually did before class and it happened during once I had dropped the class from my schedule.

About two hours in it was really intense and I started to feel like I just came out of a swimming pool with my clothes on. I also felt like I pissed myself. My vision was very distorted, I saw the walls move slightly and my depth perception was way off. 

I didn't really get any bad trips expect from when I went to the toilet. It was a small room and I saw an evil clone of myself in the mirror, it was creepy.

"To an egalitarian, yes, it is fucked up but you can't say that looking at it through the lense of egalitarianism is objective either. No philosophical theory has yet to show that it is the universal code of morality so they are all subjective. I look forward to the day when a truly objective moral theory is introduced because it will simplify things.

Edit: Not sure how it would be better if there was a groom price or no bride price on egalitarian grounds. If all people are of equal worth, then is it wrong to give their worth to the parents who are losing that worth for their family. The groom's family is retaining the groom's worth and gaining the worth of the bride but they are paying a worth equal to the bride to the bride's family so there is equality. If the groom was the one leaving, it would make sense to have a groom price and that is the case in cultures, like the Hopi. Patriarchy is just a way in which property is inherited through the father's line but is in no way unfair to the females of the family because they retain equal care by the heir or marry into a family in which they are cared for. There is no inequality there. There is a difference in what each gets or what they do but there is still an equality in that difference. You have to consider legitimate differences between males and females in your argument. Only women can have children which increases their worth and is equaled out by men taking care of them during the times that they cannot work before, during, and after childbirth. Women tend to raise children because they are the ones who were with them in the first place, again equaled out by the male providing for both mother and child. There is no inequality here. Plus, if the woman doesn't marry, as is the case increasingly, nobody pays a bride price so nobody loses. Equality there too",1

"A new neighbor started parking @ the bottom of our steep driveway, making it hard to back out. He was convinced that it was part of his property, and even though he had no formal survey to prove it (and ample parking on his actual drive) he wanted to exercise his god given property rights. 

Right next to this spot were 5 large trees, unmaintained, likely diseased, and both annoying and dangerous, dropping large branches frequently on our drive. Knowing that it was only a matter of time before branches fell on the heads of our children or on our cars, we asked for permission to get a tree service to come out and do some maintenance (offering to pay for all - not an inexpensive proposition). Response... ""No"". If something happens ""that's what insurance is for"". Trying to reason further only caused anger and the threat to call the police on us if we trespassed on his property as well as the threat of litigation if we touched the trees...Welcome to the neighborhood!

Knowing that the trees were likely @ least near the property line, we decided to have a formal survey done so that we could go ahead and remove any branches shown to be overhanging our property (which is within our legal rights). The survey was expensive, but the best money we ever spent. Why? It turns out that all the trees and his parking spot at the end of our drive were fully on OUR property - not even close to the property line. We ended up cutting down OUR trees a few weeks later.

Well, the neighbor of course never apologized, and angry about what we did to our own property (and embarrassed to eat crow) has started acting like a petulant child. He has come up with endless creative ways to purposely annoy us, the latest being blasting loud dance music past 1:30am.  This is a guy who's about 50 years old and with children of his own...

If I had to answer the question, what is my secret? I'd probably say that it helps if you genuinely try to enjoy the interaction. People are fascinating. You can learn a lot from them, even if they seem much simpler than yourself. Interacting, to me, just feels good.

"Until about age 12 (I'm in my mid 30s now) I used to have a lot of trouble falling asleep. I just couldn't stop thinking. Almost always it was about problems. It could be any kind of problem--usually something social at school or with my family, but it could be something imaginary or something to do with science or whatever.

Whatever problem I was thinking about, I would think of the problem and its intricacies, then think of steps to take to a solution, and then I'd be like ""Great. I can go to sleep now."" Three minutes later, I'd have forgotten my solution or the steps to get to it and have to start all over.

Sometimes around age 12 I realized that if I memorized all these parts--the intricacies of the problem and the steps to the solution--I wouldn't have to keep replaying the scenario in my head. In other words, I needed to catalogue my thoughts on the matter so that when the problem popped into my mind, I could recall everything I'd though and be done with it quickly. 

I practised this cataloguing and eventually succeeded. I started falling asleep in under an hour, which was a record for me at the time. As time went on and I got better and better, I got it down to 5-15 minutes depending on how complex the issue(s) I was facing were. And, to help things even more, as I've gotten older, I've gotten better at dismissing some problems as not worth my time and also not spending my time on things and people who create more problems than good.

Now when I go to bed, I'm asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow so long as my wife and my dog allow me enough space to get comfortable on the bed.

A word of advice about this method, though: just because you catalogue it doesn't mean you are an expert or know everything there is to know. If I'm having a social problem or even an academic problem, I work it through as best as I can, but when tomorrow comes, I still try to be very open to insights other people may have.

Finally, one thing I find very important to avoid is doing something before bed that requires really getting my head into in a problem-solving way. From time to time, my work requires me to develop complex spreadsheets or coding. If I work on this before bed, it might keep me up thinking about the problems, but usually not. What it does frequently do, though, is turn all of my dreams into unanswerable formula and coding problems. I am stressed the whole night because I'm working with nonsensical numbers in my dreams. The same goes for strategy video games.",1
"Ehhh, when you see the amount of goat's cheese, plus all the avocado and chunks of steak in there, plus how I drown it in dressing, it loses a bit of the healthy factor, but still, they're all good fats, I guess, so it's pretty decent. It's just packed with like everything I need, you know, I used to basically eat just this salad, pretty decent sized serving, every day, and that was all I'd consume usually, other than coffee and beer. I would have this for dinner after shift work and then it would pretty much keep me going until the next night (things were a little tight back then and it was the cheapest way I could get healthy, filling, and still delicious food into me, the fats would usually keep me pretty satisfied for a good long while).",2

"That's the problem. Not everybody does know that. Many comments in this thread are from people who have had a problem with such ignorant types. Some men are outright selfish, and ignore any signs a woman projects of discomfort, fear, or anything else that's a nonverbal cue to BTFO.

What you have to understand is that some women are outright afraid to give a straight solid ""no"" and some have had the experience of their ""no"" being entirely ignored and disregarded, and even seen as a challenge, or met with violent outbursts. Being direct is not in some women's nature because of how they've been brought up, socialized, or taught via scary encounters.

You might not be the type to call her an ugly cunt and say you weren't even interested when she says ""sorry, no""; you might not be the type to follow her home from work and keep asking over and over and over again. But there are those types, and woman are afraid strange men *might* be. It's a game called Schroedinger's Rapist, and it is decidedly un-fun for everyone playing.

So they deflect, they are vague, and they drop hints. I wish it wasn't so, I wish it wasn't basically necessary, but until other men make the effort to rescue and protect women from these Douche types, the ""afraid to be direct"" behavior won't stop. Because those men don't listen to women.",1

I'm getting really sick of this attitude that you deserve to be hurt if you don't obey the police. There's no ticking time bomb. Nothing says you *have* to get people into custody immediately. If a person presents an immediate threat, then yes, do what you have to do to stop the threat. But so often that's not the case. Much of the time, somebody is uncooperative but nonthreatening, then he gets beaten or tased or even shot, and people like you come out of the woodwork to say ""well you should have done what you were told!""

"Should Lobbying be illegal? Short answer is no, as has already been said it's an important way of petitioning MPs/Congress/whatever other political group is in charge. What is of concern is that groups with a lot of money are able to lobby very hard for representatives to vote the way they want.

I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gEz__sMVaY) amazingly insightful on this exact topic. TLDW of it is that rather than limiting money give parliament a secret ballot. When votes are public it is very easy for pressure groups of all persuasions and other interested parties to get our representatives to vote how they want. This can be done either by threats, bribery or vote swapping (you scratch my back I’ll scratch yours). If these votes are secret then suddenly representatives can vote how their conscience says. Whilst I am all for transparency the groups who can benefit most from voting records are those who can analyse the data and use it, which is those with the money and time to do so.

"Family vacation a few years ago in Costa Rica. Never went to an all inclusive resort as my parents preferred to rent places and ""live like the locals"". Anyways we get to the place and all the windows are barred (very common as the surrounding places had barred windows as well). We settle down in the place and begin to enjoy our vacation. About three days into the vacation at ~5am in the morning and I awake to a large thump. Moved to get out of bed but wasn't completely awake until I heard the shattering of glass and my Mother screaming at the top of her lungs. Rush out into the main room to see a man fishing a bag off the table with a long metal pole. He ran as soon as he got what he wanted. 

After everyone had calmed down we tried to figure out what he took. It was the lunch bag me and my dad took out on the fishing boat the day before. Two empty water bottles inside a lunchbag I think he was disappointed in his haul. Read the newspaper the next day and 6 other break-ins happened that morning.

Oh and not to mention when the driver takes you from the airport to the city they drive on those roads like maniacs and when you are overlooking a 60ft+ drop and flying down these very tight roads you feel like you might die.

"I think it's multiple factors.

1.) A rebellious feeling. Some (not all) Americans feel that we were the first to use democracy, and that the British were literally evil, when it isn't that black and white. They feel that without The U.S., the world is screwed, which is in no way true, it's pretty likely that some other country would go through the same process that we did, we just happened to be the first. This makes Americans feel like we're superior because we just happened to beat every one else to a revolution.

2.) Propaganda. When us Americans are kids, we are constantly told about how great our country is, and how terrible anything that isn't democracy is. We don't learn about the rest of the worlds history until 7th grade, and even then it's very bare bones. Before 7th grade, the U.S. is the center of attention, and we don't learn about anything else unless it has to do with the U.S. 

3.) Lack of academic drive. A consequence of not learning about the rest of the world until later in school, is that you really don't care. Your entire life you've been told that the U.S. is all you should care about, so when teachers try to teach about the rest of the worlds history, kids don't care, because the U.S. is the only country they need to worry about in their minds. Thus, they are ignorant when it comes to the outside world, a few people think the rest of the world is all socialist, and the U.S. is the only 'good' country.

Obviously, not all Americans are ignorant, but it's hard not to lack some knowledge of the outside world because of how glorified America is.

**TLDR:** The U.S. is extremely glorified and when we are young we are told the U.S. is the best at everything, thus, some people don't care about the rest of the world. Combine this with a rebellious feeling, and there you go.

I love my country, but there is a large amount of glorification in the U.S. that needs to stop.",1

This is the important part: found it on my own, on the SNES, when I was a kid just running around. Couldn't put what happened together as there was no prominent internet at the time. 

So it seriously freaked me the fuck out.

I conveyed the story to several people who thought I was insane or making things up, and now it is a known thing. It totally fucked with me, and I caused it by just running around.

You get a lot of unfiltered flavor and what people call sediment (small bits of grind that float in the coffee), which adds to a different flavor profile. It also tends to be less likely to end up over extracted like drip coffee.

"Alfred Nobel was the founder of the Nobel Peace prize. His family looked for easier ways to mine by using explosions. There were many accidents and lost limbs within his family. The local police told then they had to stop blowing stuff up on County Property so they built a big ass raft and made a lab over water. Alfred finally found a way to make dynamite stable enough to use. The military quickly got their hands on the dynamite and it was used as a weapon. When Alfreds uncle died, the news papers praised his death. They confused Alfred and his uncle and talked horribly about how the man who created dynamite is now dead thankfully since the military used his discovery to kill thousands. Alfred was so upset at the confusion of seeing how the world viewed him that when he died, he placed all of his Inheritance in an account that was not to be touched other than to giving portions away to people who created peace. Years later, the Nobel Peace Prize was founded with his money. ",1

"I was told the opposite. When in elementary school, I wrote in regular (whatever regular is called) and then I was told by my teacher than I'm not allowed to write in regular, it HAS to be cursive, especially when I get to high school.

I spent the rest of my school-life on and off, uncomfortably forcing myself to write in cursive. Then when I got into high school and I FINALLY got into the habit of writing in cursive, a teacher there told me that we're not allowed to write in cursive... fuck. So I spent all these years training for nothing.

Now, as a result, my handwriting is FUCKED (and it used to be amazing). My brother says my handwriting looks like the way a corpse would write. Now I constantly alternate between cursive and regular and it looks god awful because I'm torn between the two. In fact, some words will be in cursive, others aren't.

"Children are not people. They are not intelligent, not kind, not good. They are shitstains upon our society and it is our job to take those shitstains and teach them how to not be such a shitstain.


You should never be at war with a child, because to be at war with something implies they have free will or some semblance of authority. They have nothing. They are nothing. 


Children are like dogs, they need to be trained or they will shit everywhere. Only once their cognition kicks in around their adolescence are they to be trusted with anything outside of basic commands. 


When I deal with children, whether as a caregiver, teacher, coach, or other authority figure, I remember these crucial things. I have yet to have trouble with them. 


For those interested, my relationship with my parents is spectacular. They raised me to be critically thinking, but they never allowed me to ever disobey them. I feared even talking back to them. Then, as I grew up and began to understand life, I realized that the boundaries they created were only there to protect me and help me grow.

"My best bud and I are at my house during the summer. My parents are at work. We're both around 15years old. The 4th of July had just past and I had bottle rockets that I was itching to fire without any adults around. I started smoking the ganja at a young age so we were lit out of our minds. That day I poured myself a glass of juice and walked to my room. As I sat down and went to take a sip of my delicious MinuteMaid, (Fruit punch, the good shit) I realize my cylindrical glass is in fact the carton of Minute Maid. After the befuddlement ensued along with hysterical laughter, we went outside to light fireworks and fuck shit up. After blowing some ant hills up with a couple of M80's, I remember that my cousins setting bottle rockets on the ground and lighting them. They'd race off like hot rods on a drag strip. So its my time to shine. I set a bottle rocket on the ground and hope for the best. I light the bottle rocket and feel more adrenaline than ever. The bottle rocket goes into my neighbors pond. I wasn't impressed at all. Little did I know what was about to happen 15 minutes later. My buddy comes running into the room with fear smeared on his face and his eyes as red as the devils dick. ""THE MOTHERFUCKING POND IS ON FIRE. YOU CAUGHT THE FUCKING POND ON FIRE. I didn't mention this before, but I was in south Carolina and we hadnt had rain in weeks so the whole POND was dried out. Except for the dog piss alongside the trees. So I'm panicking. I'm trying to add the numbers of years that I'd spend in jail. I'm literally running around my house asking God to allow me to not get raped while in prison. So I tell my buddy that we will take this to the grave. I look out side and what was once just smoke has turned into a massive barreling fire tornado. Not 3 minutes later this fire truck shows up. It was my best friends POND.

"One fine Christmas day many years ago, my siblings and I went up to our cousins home in Ohio.  Cold snow outside, warm fire crackling inside, and many gifts lay beneath the festive Christmas tree.  Our grandmother had given each of us a mysterious manila envelope.  Perplexed, fascinated, and quite bewildered, we all opened them and stared at its contents:

Documents.  Hundreds of words that didn't make any sense to my 9 year old self.  We showed our parents and they just laughed and told us to put it back and go on to the next gift.  It wasn't until many years later that I found out she had bought each of us a death insurance policy, but, it was really for our parents.  If something ever happens to us, our beneficiary would get all the money.  $10,000 at maturation, I believe.  I have it somewhere and I guess I'll give it to my future wife or whoever I desire.  

Yeah, it was fucking terrible. ",1

"LSD is not for everyone, there was a person at my college that ran around campus trying to attack people because he was scared and disorientated. Some people become violent, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are inherently violent people and that somehow their 'true' self bubbled up to the surface. LSD seems profound because it is a chemical that makes things seem profound. Don't confuse the distorted reality of LSD with the way things truly are.",2

"Now probably the biggest repressed part of the LGBT world....Gay and Lesbian not an issue in everyday life and certainly accepted in the workplace....Trans (as is fully swapping gender) has become very high profile recently with Bruce - Catlyn (sp?) Jenner in the US and Frank - Kelly Maloney in UK.

...but crossdressing? I can only think of two anyway high-profile people....Eddie Izzard and Grayson Perry (and without being rude in anyway I woudn't class Grayson as the average transvestite).  

As someone who has dressed fully in public a number of times in the past to go to events I was terrified each and every time and I no longer go out dressed at all.....I used to love every part of it but now just keep it occasionally to myself in the house.

It would be nice to live in a much more tolerant world where we could wear whatever the hell we liked whenever we wanted to.",1

"I had a similar experience. When I first opened an account with them I was assured that I would pay no fees until I turned 25 (I was 20 at the time). Well guess what? A year later I kept getting tacked with $12 ""maintenance fees"" because my balance was under a certain amount (I'm a broke college student so of course there will be a low balance pretty much at all times.). They said, ""no problem! Just call in and we can get those fees waived for you"". I had to call every damn month to get that fee removed, and even then it was hit or miss. Sometimes they could waive it, sometimes they couldn't. They also closed my savings account for no reason even though there was some money in it, without telling me. I eventually got fed up and switched to Simple, and I am very pleased with their service.",1
