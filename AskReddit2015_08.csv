I would then make a drink, sit down on their couch and begin to watch television at an obnoxiously loud volume, the victims would then awake and presumably ask me to leave their house and threaten to call the cops, in-which i would start to argue that the house in question is actually mine, and would point them to the scrapbooks, photos and such, all of which now display the photo's of myself. All this time i would act genuinely worried that i never realised them asleep upstairs, and would be acting panicky as they (probably) held weapons towards me. Once they checked the scrapbooks and family photo's etc, i would then grab a weapon i also brought in with me and hid close to where i sat, and would threaten the victims, shouting them to leave or else i will call the cops, all this during their confusion as to what the hell is happening.",1

For the next 5-6 hours, we talked about everything under the sun while my dad sat there punctuating by making that tub fart. I learned about my dads adventures in Japan and Korea when he was in the military, the hooker that fell in love with him after he met my mom, we swapped war stories, my mother talked about her estranged father who had died recently, issues with my sisters kids, my current and past girlfriends, etc. All punctuated by varying types of fart noises.

"The most legitimate reasons tend to be related to theft.

* Delivery drivers have used company gas cards to fill up their (and family/friends) personal vehicles. They've also made mini mart purchases on said cards. Accounting invariably picks up on it and said offenders are 86'd immediately.
* Stealing time is also pretty bad. Employees have punched other employees' time cards in/out (on camera), often when those other employees didn't even come into work on that particular day. The old physical timeclock eventually got replaced with a handprint timeclock.
* Janitor was stealing supplies. One of the folks in the front office picked up on it when they noticed him taking black trash bags filled with _something_ to his van periodically. The next day the foreman went out with him to his van and found a cache of umpteen paper towel rolls, toilet paper rolls (same brand/packaging etc as the company's supplies) in there. Pretty embarrassing to lose your job over toilet paper.

There have also been the drunk/hungover folks, office romances-gone-bad, physical confrontations, etc that you always hear about. But the most cut and dried terminations in my opinion have always been theft.",2

Indirect contact. You scratch your nose/cough into your hand, then touch something then maybe a mother touches the same thing and passes it to her kid, or maybe an elderly person touches whatever you contaminated.

So, in your opinion, the possibility of preventing someone's death (possibly even your own) is not worth being poked in the arm?

Boy, was that a mistake.  

She instantly pounced on me and asked if I celebrated Christmas. I said I did. With a dismissive tone in her voice, and a wave of her hand, she said, ""Then you ain't an atheist."" 

She believes one must be a believer, a christian believer, in order to celebrate Christmas. Otherwise, non believers have no right to give and receive gifts. To have and decorate a christmas tree. To sing christmas carols. To do *anything* christmas related.  And if they do, then they are a liar and a hypocrite. 

It kinda got under my skin when she said that. But I didn't dare try to argue with her. She is one of those closed minded people that will *never* change, and who refuses to listen to and consider the opinions of those that oppose hers. It really wasn't worth wasting enegy on.

"Wow man, I'm sorry. I truly do feel for you. I was in a similar situation in high school when I started dating this amazing athletic and beautiful girl, she had me from hello In high school I was a top athlete myself with great grades so I was pretty popular and one of those people that could hang out with anyone in the school no matter creed or color. I knew of her through out middle and high school but I didn't really feel I had a chance with her until my senior summer when we hung out and started dating. I fell in love with her and I enjoyed every second with her. I went to most of all of her games that I could seeing that I was also working 30 hours a week to save for a university and going to a state college while also doing high school classes. Near the end of my senior year and our one year anniversary things between me and her were distancing and I had a feeling she was cheating on me. I was trying so hard to recover what we had because I truly wanted it to last. Well a week before graduation she made me break up with her because she couldn't do it, she said it was because I never went to her games and other stuff that I tried to make it to but couldn't because of work. She pretty much dropped me. Well every year after graduation the seniors rent condos on the beach and party for a week, I was put in charge of getting one for me and my buddies and at the time my girlfriend. I was pretty broken up about the whole break up and I told her that since I was paying the most on the condo that I would give her money back and she could go and stay with her other friends instead but she wasn't having any of that so I had my hands tied and she came that week. Well long story short, she came that week and ended up hooking up with my best friend and stayed in the condo. She ruined one of the weeks that I should always remember as fun and exciting but it ended up depressing and anger filled. She numbed me and it's so hard for me to actually care about any female right now because I she messed me up but I'm trying my best to get over that. I find myself thinking about her a lot and wanting to text her and talk to her but I pull myself away knowing she would probably mess me up more. I've seen her once after the whole thing went down at a friends party and It brought up old feelings and I wanted to be with her still even after all the stuff she did. Love sucks...",1

So, after 9/11, your mother still wore the hijab as if 9/11 didn't happen or was a good thing.

Let's make an analogy, shall we? If a new religion is invented and people have to wear green hats, people will look at them weirdly. Green hats are unnecessary and only symbolize your membership to that religion. And, if the members of that religion bomb a mall, then you can't simply still wear your green hat and expect everything to be fine.

I hope not to insult you, but this is what happened to a lot of cults and dogmas. Nazis believed in economic productivity, hard work, scientific endeavor. But, they also killed a lot of people. So, now, swastikas and other symbols are forbidden. I don't mean to insult you, I'm helping you understand why the people hated the hijab.

My parents had me at 16 so i was fairly poor and took great care to what crayons or toys i had and etc. Through the years my dad started to become successful, made good money and we became pretty well off (note: i live with my grandmother my dad was an alcoholic) every weekend he got to be with my sister and i before going to live with his gf hed take her and i everywhere. Go kart racing, renting boats to learn how to drive one, resorts. If i needed something or wanted something i just had to ask but my dad was more about reason, and if i had a good reason for what i wanted hed try his best to get it for me. Recently he took my sister and i to our first cruise and hes been on several ever since meeting his gf. 

My bf on the other hand grew up okay, not poor, but his parents would spend their money on booze or goats, chickens , horses etc. Not so much on their kids. They never took him and his brother out and now his brother is 17 and a couch potato, beyond close minded , and just because he doesnt know what tabouli is he will not even try it nor look at it. Its been difficult to open my bf up. His best friend would make fun of me and call me fancy , etc whenever i took them to a nice resturaunt. Theyre the type to think they dont belong. In all reality no one cares what you look like just have good manners and people will treat you right in ""rich areas"" . ive stopped inviting his best friend along because he completely kills my process of opening up my bf to new places and new types of food , and etc. My bf is now becoming more open and independent, although sometimes his mom or dad will complain hes ""going out too much""  which infuriates me because whats so wrong with being around new people, seeing new beaches,museums, gardens, or car shows on his days off from HIS JOB WITH HIS CAR?  I want to take him to marina del rey and show him how to drive a boat soon but because of his parents poor upbringing of him its difficult.

If you wear anything but a sports bra to work and you work a physical job, instant boob pain all day. But honestly bras are so fucking expensive that most of us barely own enough sports bras to get us through a week.

I don't think most women know what their ACTUAL breast size is, we just kind of guess based on what fits because getting measured for that shit is uncomfortable when wee young and we're confident we know what's best.

Taking a bra off at the end of the day is fantastic, but if you live with other people you better have a repertoire of exceedingly baggy t-shirts to make sure people cant see your nips.
Also-- if we go anywhere WITHOUT a bra? instant coldness. We get so used to the heat staying in that we often are not used to breezes.

We normally pay like $50-150 for a good bathing suit because fashion industries are corrupt.

Do you know how much shit I lose in my cleavage? Crumbs in a bra is the worst feeling.

I can't tell what's muscle and what I think might be a breast lump half the time.
Also, why do I have to pay a doctor to squish my boobs and tell me everything is okay there? That's a privilege, he should be paying me.

Also consult /r/pcmasterrace (they're somewhat stuck up but know a whole lot about PCs) and /r/buildapc for information on which parts to buy and how to build it if you're confused.

I spent ~$1500 building a PC (it was way cheaper than buying, and more fun), I can give you my parts list if you want as a guideline (only spent around $1000 on the PC, I bought all new peripherals too).",1

Our futon sofa had a couple of bolts that had presumably been substituted for a bolt that wasn't available (and was shorter). The outcome was that the sofa didn't clear the bolts when being changed to a bed. We called the shop and they delivered another one, with exactly the same problem. We solved eventually by visiting a hardware shop.

"True, but Comcast can only fuck up your life so much. People chewing with open mouths are assholes but can't hurt you. Anti-vaxxers can cause some serious harm, especially if enough of them get their way. However, that seems unlikely; it's a rather vocal minority, and, with luck, some trickle-down education may just land on them.

Now, with the anti-turn-signal crowd, it's a different story. These folks are driving literally every day. They're piloting a 1 ton or heavier death machine operating at speeds for which the human brain has had no evolutionary time to prepare the senses and the reaction times, and for which the body is physically unable to take in the event things go wrong. Incorrect use of turn signals can be attributed to as many as 2 million preventable car accidents a year, and hundred of millions, potentially billions, of dollars in damages and healthcare costs. 

So, yeah. I'd say bitching about turn signals is a valid complaint. Comcast, unsightly chewers of food, and anti-vaxxers don't kill, maim, or destroy nearly as many people and things as bumbling assholes with poor wrist control and a dick-headed desire to not have to hear the indicator ticking.

Furthermore, you're implying that the only value of an education is employment. I would say that society benefits as a whole by having better educated people. That way, you're less likely to get people who say that evolution is a myth, global warming isn't real or that vaccines cause autism. 

Also, people moved away from those jobs because they fucking suck. Do you like cleaning backed up toilets?

Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand. Still having trouble wrapping my head around some of the concepts...,1
"Second year of college.  


My friend and roommate from my freshman year had joined a frat and they were having a party. I was invited so I went along. Upon arrival I was presented with 9 shots that alternated between Jack Daniels and Goldschlager (sp?). Mind you I was a 140 lb, 19 year old dude with a high metabolism.
  

""Pick your poison"" he tells me. Ok so I start doing shots. Maybe 45 min later those shots are gone. I grab a Hornsby's cider. To this day I don't know why I remember this to such detail.
I'm sitting on the couch, feeling pretty drunk and I notice that the only light I'm able to see any more is when the strobe light in the room flashes. One of my last conscious thoughts was ""oh shit... this can't be good"".  
  

... and that's the last that I remember of the night.  
  

I wake up the next morning with the worst hangover I've ever had in my entire life, in an unfamiliar place, wearing clothes that aren't mine, but that I recognize because they were from the stage crew at my high school, which my buddy and I were both a part of. I crawled out of an enclosed sleeping space to find my buddy and one of his frat bros sitting there, laughing at me, somewhat amazed that I'm conscious.  
  

I feel like shit so I bail. It's literally nothing more than a few hundred yards to my apartment. I make it as far as about 50 ft outside of the frat house on a Sunday morning to stop and puke up some thick green goo while a pledge and his parents watch from a short distance, horrified, and then do some dry heaving. Then I stumble back to my apartment where my redneck roommate Bill (aka Mr. Shotgun) laughs at my dumb ass when he comes home and finds me in a hangover cocoon.  

Weeks later I'm visiting the frat house friend at his girlfriend's apartment and I'm told what happened to me that night after my memory cuts out.  
  

**THE MISSING TIME**  

(the story according to observers)  
  
  

At that point I lose memory is also the point where I lost consciousness, fell to the floor and began vomiting profusely. I had really overdone it. An online BAC calculator estimates my BAC at the time to be 0.25, which is ridiculous. WHOOPS.  

So they drag my dumb, vomit-covered, unconscious ass to the showers and throw me in. They figure out pretty quickly that cold and hot water shock me briefly awake and warm water puts me to sleep, so they alternate me in-between the two. I am still fully clothed at this point. After about 30 min of this along with more vomiting I achieve a state of barely conscious but still drunk out of my mind.
They get me standing, supporting me on both sides as I get walk/dragged through the house. Remember, this is a frat house so there are room parties going on. I apparently decide to join or attempt to join several room parties. I'm told that I went, still soaking wet, into these parties and started trying to dance and carry on while most of the people in those rooms responded to me in just about the same way you'd expect them to respond had a zombie burst into the room only to start dancing and acting like an idiot instead of eating people. I'm also told that I briefly got ahold of a whippet and that just made things worse if not mildly hilarious for a minute or two.  
  

They got me back to frat bro's room and I went out again. They stripped me completely naked, dried me off, put me in clean, dry clothes and shoved me into an enclosed sleeping space. The story then picks up above where I wake up.  
  

Needless to say I was nearly in shock when told all of this information. Two years later I was dating my now-girlfriend when I told her this story. She laughed and told me that her boyfriend of that same time frame related this story to her as this idiot he went to high school with that he saw get near-death drunk at a frat party and do a bunch of stupid shit.

"I have the exact same thing. See if you have noticed the same things as me:

-If I get stressed out, my hands flare up bright red around the index finger to the thumb and across the knuckles. At its worse, my hands crack and bleed, so I use liquid bandage just to seal the wound. 

-It's more controlled in the summer with humidity, sun and exercise (I also feel better when it's sunny).

-All it takes to start burning is an unusually cool day (like today) + any added stress. As the weather gets colder, my hands suffer, so I stress out and the cycle continues.

-What helps calm it down temporarily is Vaseline (with or without gloves) and Aveeno Baby Eczema. Lotion soap with Aloe is good too.

I feel your pain and still have a difficult time trying to calm myself before I break out. ",1

Ever drive in NYC???   If you put your blinkers on people speed up to NOT let you in. That one more car in front of them means they miss the light.  They also feel that if you are polite enough to put your blinker in then you are too polite to do what is necessary to move forward in the undulation that is NYC traffic.  You get such bad habits that when you drive outside the City you have to retrain yourself.  ,1

"I used to work as an archaeologist (relevant username).  We had one guy in our crew that had a trowel that he loved.  He had it since undergrad (archaeologists get weird about their trowels).  Anyway, we were working for the Forest Service in West Virginia doing shovel testing in some pretty remote timber stands.  It was a ""drive 3 hours on forest service roads, then hike 8 miles in"" sort of area.  And we're not talking about trail hiking, this is bushwacking and navigating by topo.  

Anywho, one day the guy loses his trowel.  He was pretty upset and we spent a good bit of time helping him try to find it.  No luck.

Flash forward to the *next year*.  We're both back working for the Forest Service again that summer on the crew together, doing more timber stand clearing.  One day we're bushwacking out to get to our site for the day and the guy just stops in the middle of the woods and says ""No fucking way!""

Yup that trowel was on the ground right in front of him.  We looked around and sure enough we see our old backfilled test pits around us.  We had, totally by accident, in the middle of several hundred square miles of forest, wandered into the site we worked on the previous year without realizing it, and then walked practically over this guy's lost trowel.

I honestly would never have believed it if I wasn't there to see it.",4

1\. How is PTSD ""sterile""?

Certainly ""battle fatigue"" or ""operational exhaustion"" are euphemisms, but ""post-traumatic stress disorder"" emphasizes (a) trauma, and (b) the fact that the condition lasts a long time. ""Shell shock"", on the other hand, makes it seem like you got dazed and maybe need a stiff drink and a good night's sleep.

2\. Shell shock is not the only kind of lasting trauma.

The phrase PTSD is useful because it is *not* a euphemism, but unites similar symptoms that occur in people who have experienced trauma for any number of reasons, often compounded by betrayal either by family, community, country, or just the illusion of safety and control in life.

3\. Vietnam wasn't special.

People with combat-related PTSD, whatever the language around the phrase, have been betrayed after returning from war since time immemorial. That's not some new phenomenon following American defeat in Vietnam.

"My best friend definitely.  We lived in the same dorm our freshman year of college and just immediately clicked.  I remember calling him my best friend after a month or two into my first semester.  We're exact opposites in almost every single way, but we each have strengths in areas where the other is weak.  We have very complimentary personalities. 

It's been 11 years since we first met and we now live nearly 1,000 miles apart, but we talk 2-3 times a week and text basically non-stop.  ",2

I'm just going to let you decide on that one.,2
"&gt;In conclusion, yes the Civil War actually was about slavery, and furthermore the southern gentry were nothing but violent barbarians, all of whom should have been executed at the end of the war.

False, but keep believing the propaganda, after all, the government always has the interest of it's people at heart right?

The fact that black people are still enslaved today in america COMPLETELY destroys the notion that the war was fought to end slavery. The north's aggression was not about ending slavery, but rather transferring ownership of privately-owned slaves, to the government.

Do you think the rebels of the colonies should have been executed too?

In a similar question, how would you feel if the white house said ""hey, tomorrow, all internet commerce is gonna be outlawed...but only in California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon""....what do you suspect the backlash/reaction would be?",1
