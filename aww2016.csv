"To train a husky the first step is dont train them when they are hyper its like teaching physics to a kid on meth. You need to run them. When we had Husky owners who wanted to train the dog we had them drop off the dog 2 hours early and we ran the dog like a sled dog for 2 hours straight. Once you have the dog tired but not drop dead exhausted you begin to train. The first thing a typical trainer teaches is the lure with a treat. Instead of using a treat dip 2 fingers into peanut butter then wipe it off with a dry towel do this before training where the dog cant see you. This will get the dogs attention because of the scent but he will only see your fingers. After a while drop down to 1 finger then to none after a week or two. The next thing they teach is reward treats. This step is the hardest thing to break a dog of once its been taught but the best way to do it with a toy instead of a treat. Get them a toy they will love and give it to them for an hour or two then take it away. After they are done training you give them the toy but take it away in a half hour. Whenever you are doing this make sure to congratulate and play with the dog alot. Training a dog isnt about teaching it or teaching you its about bonding with each other. Trainers try to teach you both mannerisms to communicate with, but thats not what makes a dog amazing. Being partners and bonding is what its all about you want the dog to do things for you because he loves you not because he loves food. The first step is always to make sure the dog has been run never teach them when they are hyper it will undo what you taught them the day before. I have trained 12 Huskies they are all the same in this regard they have this in common with German Shepherds.",0

Orange guy was tiny when my wife picked him out and scared of his own shadow.  At night he would sneak under the covers and wrap his body around my forearm facing my wife's torso.  I became his litter mate and to this day he is happiest with my arm parallel with his tummy and face into my palm, like a head sucker in Alien, snoozing away as I play console games on the bed or couch.

He is the kindest soul I've ever known and even clears his nether regions himself, by pulling the hair out by the root.  Vet had never seen anything like it.  We had to shave the area ourselves to keep it tangle free, him being a long hair indoor/outdoor cat.

Doggie is healing, has had nightmares and multiple deep puncture wounds.  She tore a lot of neck, back and intercostal muscles defending herself.  She's 13.  She'd doing better.  

I filed a police report after the fucking dickwad bitched about the $60 vet bill (this is Mexico, we are both American), and bragged he'd continue to ""walk"" them off-leash even though the next attack might kill a baby.  So I filed a police report, they hauled his ass in, and he came with his mommy to apologize to me before the cops, pay the bill (mommy had to pay because at 27, he didn't have the money) and now its on file that he's ordered to never have his dogs off-leash.

And I bough a club taser off Amazon and it will arrive here any day.  He's some crackhead and I'll happily crack his skull open if he or his dogs get near me again.

Seeing SEVEN dogs running at you full-bore is fucking terrifying. ",105

I think reddit likes dog breeds but I think they are just unhappy with most  current breed organizations and standards.  We operate in 2016 with DNA test and open information whereas groups like the AKC and many breed clubs are stuck in 1975 with no openness and are political messes that allow for dogs to become genetic messes.  Just look at how the AKC doesn't have every dog's extensive pedigree open to the public.  You can buy an AKC dog and have no idea what the heck that dog's percentage inbreeding is.,1

He stopped [jumping up in the Jeep]( http://i.imgur.com/ZxkkYqi.jpg) around the same time his face started turning white. 


Now he's just a grumpy old dog. He takes anti-inflammatory meds for his legs and we've only had one really big scare when he developed an inner ear/ cochlear infection (which effects dogs with bizarre and unexpected symptoms see:idiopathic vestibular disease).

[Now that he's 16](http://i.imgur.com/o7WNPfe.jpg) I have to watch him for clues to how he's doing. I'll go bankrupt doing anything and everything to make sure he's healthy, but at the same time, I've accepted his coming death and am keen to not let him suffer. ",1

But like I said, when I say small I don't mean tiny, I mean small...for a pig. And it's also important to keep in mind the really small ones (like 60lbs and under) are usually runts of the litter, and babies of those runts are NOT guaranteed to also be small runts. So getting a pig under 60lbs is really a crap shoot, though the 80lb range is a little more predicable if you get them from someone reputable. ",6

"He may not understand how much you love him, but he's happy to be by your side, I'm sure. Is he trained? A Service Dog? I'd suggest the vest when you're out and about with him if he is. I generally find it tends to ward off more problems than it creates, but that's my own experience. If someone's going to give you a hard time, they're going to whether the vest's there or not. I've had staff tell me they appreciate the vest because it reduces customer complaints and makes it easier to protect my rights if they can point it out to the whiners.

As for the ""therapy dog"" thing, the more genuine people we have spreading the word, the better. We've made progress. It's slow, but we're making it.

Several years ago I got into an argument with a local service dog training organization who basically tried to slander me and say I was spreading lies about Psych Service Dogs being covered under the ADA. (Before it was revised, it didn't exclude psych dogs, but the examples it gave for the definition only included physical disabilities.) I even had a well-known SD training org tell me that dogs were only capable of being trained to help with physical disabilities and word among the Psych Dog community was that that organization was actively trying to change the ADA's Service Dog definition to be physical-disability-specific.

Things have changed since then; there's more acceptance, but it's slow. I still have people asking me why I need a big dog and not some purse dog (or even a dog at all!) even after I explain about balance issues and needing a dog that can be forceful enough to break through the mental fog. So... yeah, I can relate. Fully.

I'm just starting to get people around me to understand, and I start by:

""You know how when you get stuck on a problem you can take a break then get back to it later with a fresh mind? Well, the part of my brain that allows me to pull away from the problem doesn't work. The switch on the track is broken and I get stuck in a loop stuck in a loop stuck in a loop stuck in a loop stuck in a loop-"" 

And they go ""Hey!"" or they whack me and I grin and say ""that's what my dog does for me.""

It is quite the annoyance, but is very minor compared to some of the other issues it can cause.

&gt;In 1982, 40 million cans of Bumble Bee tuna were recalled due to holes in some cans.[9] In 2007, a case of botulism caused by food produced at a Castleberry's Food Company plant owned and operated by Bumble Bee prompted a recall. In 2010, the USDA announced a recall of Bumble Bee chicken salad products because of plastic pieces found inside.[10]

When I was ten we got our first cat. When I was twelve - I had my room on ground level and during the summer I always slept with my windows wide open - I woke up one night, because the cat hopped on my chest and was purring loudly.

I petted him and after a short while I took him gently in my arms - planning to carry him to the window and setting him down outside - and stood up.

First step was '*I stepped on something squishy*'. Second step was '*I stepped on something else - also squishy*'.
After that I turned on the lights and saw four dead mice lying on the ground right in front of my bed.

Sadly - being an ignorant teen - I freaked out, threw the mice and our cat out the window and closed it.

The next day I learned what it means when a cat brings you his prey and felt like shit. Luckily it only took a few days for us being friends again.",12

"Step number 1, keep the puppy on a leash and with you all the time. Let him off the leash for play time with you (ideally this would be at least 2 hours a day) or when he is outside (if you have a fence). Many people let new puppies run wild in their house from day 1. This is not necessary by any stretch of the imagination. Giving the puppy structure from the get go will help enormously with training. On top of that, if you forget to take him outside every couple hours (s)he will be right next to you when they start going potty and you can immediately pick them up and correct the behavior by taking them outside.  Make them earn being off leash in the house permanently (&lt;-- this does not mean they need to earn off leash play time, they still need to get good exercise). If you start to notice a consistent behavior of your dog when they need to go potty, start rewarding it anytime you see it and immediately take them outside to potty. Reward them after they potty outside.

Puppies can start learning right away, don't think you can't teach things to a puppy. Start working on sit right away. Read up on clicker training. Puppies are like children in that they have a short attention span. Keep training sessions short at the beginning.",1

"That was my daughter! My daughter was a dream baby who slept through the night early, rarely cried, and was easy to ""figure out"". I felt like a pro by the time she was 15 months old. So I decided to have another one.

When my daughter was just over 2, I had my son. My son quickly set about destroying every illusion I had about being a good parent. He cried so much that my neighbors called the police. He had some sort of sensory issue that caused him to be hyper sensitive and overreactive to everything. Sometimes he would cry for an hour and we'd try everything you try as a normal parent, only to do something like remove his socks and have him suddenly go silent. I remember sitting in the rocking chair one night around the 3-4 month mark, with him screaming in my arms, and just breaking down. In that darkest moment, I understood why people kill their children. That's horrible to say, I know, but that was my thought. Not that I wanted to kill mine, but I suddenly understood how people could become so overwhelmed that they just snapped. I got up and put him on the floor, with him still screaming, and went to the bathroom to get myself together.

Humorously enough, once we got past the infant stage, my son became my ""easy"" child. My daughter, however, became the child who destroys everything she touches. She put vaseline on her bedroom wall, she poured comet on the kitchen floor so they could ""skate"", she poured a whole bottle of lotion on herself, she cut her own hair. If she was unsupervised for even a second, she was into something, and she was astounding good at breaking through ""childproof"" locks and latches. Once she drew stripes all over her brother with sharpie and announced that he looked like Tigger, and she did it in the ten minutes it took me to make their lunch. I didn't even know we owned a sharpie!",81

"I'm pretty sure that as time goes on the hormone levels (i.e. Oxytocin  ) responsible for bonding are not nearly as high, so while the bond of family is still there, as it is ingrained upon the dog, the level of protectiveness and basically obsession with the pup wears off. 

This is normal because dogs grow up and may eventually leave the pack to go on their own. I suppose it happens faster in dogs as they mature faster. 

I'm sure that if you remove the puppy too early its quite bad for the baby, and likely the mother would be extremely stressed. But eventually it must be seen that the baby is going off on its own, which is somewhat a part of nature.

"May I ask you a question about people in Seattle? It's a bit of a read and I do apologize beforehand, but I think it's an interesting question to ask: 

A friend of mine and her husband took a trip to Iceland and stayed there for several weeks. Her biggest takeaway from interacting with the people there was that they have a very dry, dark sense of humor and a unique philosophy on life. You see, all of Iceland sits on volcanoes. They get their electricity from them, they actively believe in myths and legends that incorporate them. Volcanoes are a big deal that plays an active role in their culture.

However, my friend believes that it affects Icelanders on an even deeper and more fundamental level. Because they live in such close proximity to over two dozen active volcanoes, Mother Nature could straight up assassinate all of them at any moment, without warning or care. And so they live under this cloud of possibly imminent danger that makes them very darkly funny, warm people who try to value and enjoy the simpler pleasures in life, because there's just no knowing what tomorrow will bring.

And it's not like living in California or something, where maybe a tectonic plate will shift and that's the end of things. No, you can *see* these volcanoes. It acts as a constant visual reminder that everyone is just a roll of the dice away from a completely unavoidable death. The affect could be profound. For example, my friend told me of a conversation she had with a local shop owner. She asked him ""What do you think of this save the whales thing?"" and he, a native of Iceland, replied with a grin ""Eh, fuck the whales,"" and he shrugged and burst out laughing, because it may not even make a difference to him either way. He could just be dead tomorrow. She described this as a ""very Icelandic"" response.

Do you think the same thing, this same characterization, applies to people in Seattle, due to their own proximity to volcanoes?

Ok there may be negatives but do they mention the negatives with litter? Not hey dont. Just imagine your cat walking in a litter box full of germs no matter how often you clean it. When hes done he walks in your house spreading those germs. Also the litter may get stuck to his paws and he could eat them which potentially could clog his intestines. Its not likely but happens in young kittens more often. So you decide. A slightly unsanitary litter box without being able to monitor piss or constantly having shit and litter spread all over your house. They also make a ton of money selling litter so if it became common for people to train cats to use the toilet they may lose money. No one wants that...so obviously they will say its bad. I believe there are more risks with litter than a toilet.,2

"Except the one who should be dominant is you, not any of the dogs. 

Food aggression is a bad behavior to have in a dog. I have a breeder in the family too and I've owned several dogs myself. I don't let my dogs act like wild animals because they're not. They're descended from wolves sure. So are Pugs and Chihuahuas. They're not wild animals though, they're domesticated dog breeds, and if you're going to own a dog you should take responsibility for it, and for its actions.

A dog that thinks it's okay to attack something taking its food can attack anyone, even an unknowing child or bystander. When your dog bites a person because they got too close to its food, are you going to tell them that it's just ""what dogs do""?

What about if it tries to establish dominance on someone or their dog and injures them? It shouldn't be trying to establish dominance at all because it should be looking at *you* as the person calling the shots. And the shot you should call is to forbid any aggression between it and other dogs. Otherwise you're going to get a dog that will try to establish dominance over every dog it meets, and that's not good behavior. No one's dog is going to just accept being dominated, and their owner is going to be pissed when your dog starts tearing into theirs because of dominance. 

You should be in control of your dogs, instead of letting them have free run over everything and everyone.",29

Anyways, my parents adopted the kitten and were in the paper. They named her Lucky. Lucky had a good and happy home for a while...turned out she had Feline Leukemia and she passed away a little while later (the local paper published an article with the headline ""Little kitten runs out of Luck"")

"We have our dog on Zonisamide for epilepsy.  It's much easier on their system then pheno.  He doesn't require liver checks.  Also the timing of the dose doesn't have to be as precise. You can be off a couple of hours and it doesn't matter much.  Side effects are mild. There might be some loss of coordination at first while he gets used to the drug. My dog is completely normal and has not had any seizures on the medicine. When the vet suggested to ween him off to see if the seizures came back, we did and he had 2 seizures in one month so he went back on it. He takes it twice a day every day for the last 4-5 years. The only follow up he needs is an annual test to make sure the Zonisamide levels in his blood are correct.  If not then the vet can adjust the dose. 

It's a human medication.  It's very expensive most places but it's super cheap at Costco pharmacy. Also you don't have to be a member of Costco to use their pharmacy. It seems like a lot of vets don't know about this drug for dogs yet. Our dog was diagnosed at an animal hospital that had a neurologist on staff. She originally prescribed it.

"What kind of chickens did you have? I never had to teach mine to walk up a ramp. Hell I wish that had been needed, I would have made sure not to teach them how to go upstairs.

What I'm saying is I came into the laundry room to find our chickens had annexed it into their new bedroom. And they didn't want to leave either. 

They also figured out how to get into the feed bins, we had a screen door mounted backwards in our feed shed (so it swung into the room instead out out into the outdoors) and they figured out if they hit the latch it would open up. Once it was open my fat ass giant hen sat in front of the door until the rooster came in, and the rooster would fly at the top of the bin until he knocked off the lid and they would feast.

They will scar their vocal cords so the dogs can't bark so that they can have 500 dogs in one barn without people knowing. When female dogs stop reproducing, they shoot them and kill them. They do so much fucked up shit to the dogs. This isn't hobbyists having a couple litters. They're having hundreds of litters and doing it unlicensed and causing harm to the dogs. Not the original person you questioned on where you draw the line but I would draw the line at a point where you can't properly care for all dogs involved and can't give them a proper lifestyle. Being caged just to have litter after litter is completely different than having dogs give birth and properly raising all the puppies and caring for the mother. If you can't do that anymore, you've become a mill. The Amish are just terrible.

"Here's the thing. You said a ""stoat is a weasel.""

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies weasels, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls stoats weasels. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying ""weasel family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Mustelids, which includes things from wolverines to polecats to honey badgers.

So your reasoning for calling a stoat a weasel is because random people ""call the small ones weasels?"" Let's get ermine and ferrets in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A stoat is a stoat and a member of the mustelid family. But that's not what you said. You said a stoat is a weasel, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the mustelid family weasels, which means you'd call otters, minks, and other mammals weasels, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?",14

"Best I can say is good luck.  Does little kitty hiss every time big kitty gets near?  If so, I'm not optimistic.

Until last summer (that is for about six years' coexistence), periodically big kitty would act friendly, lick little kitty's face, and they'd hang out sort of together.  But last summer, big kitty was sick (kidney infection), and got very grumpy, and really bit little kitty (resulted in an abscess on his rear end).  Since then little kitty hisses every time big is close, even if big is being sort of non-aggressive.

I have tried Feliway spray again (I used it in the first couple years after I got little kitty) and I do think it is reducing the level of conflict.  But sometimes, I just have to put big kitty in a room by himself for an hour's time-out.

Other suggestions:  Play with them together (maybe one just watches, but...) for ten or fifteen minutes every day - at about the same time.  

I assume you have two litter boxes, one for each.  And make sure there are perches or the like, where one can escape the attention of the other.  

You may end up having two kitties who are not really friends, who sort of ""time-share"" you.  No cute pics of them cuddled up together; but, if you are out of the house 10 hours a day, there's still some companionship there.  I am semi-retired and home most of the time.  But if I'm away for a day, they're always hanging out in the same room together when I get home

"Pit bulls were originally bred to kill dogs and bulls. That thought should always be in the back of the mind of a pit bull owner. They aren't bred to be human aggressive. They can be perfect family dogs. But they shouldn't be trust to run around livestock and other dogs unless under close supervision by someone that knows how to see when play turns to aggression. 

People who are really into the breed don't let their dogs be together unless they can watch them. They know what their breed was bred to do. Then you have people that rescue them from a shelter or buy one to look tough and get so surprised when it mauls their other dog. Or kills the neighbors livestock. But it was only ever raised with love! How could that happen?

 If I'm at the dog park and I see a bully breed, I will call my dog away from it. If that dog does snap and decide to kill my dog there very little people can do. If you give an attacking Labrador a swift kick to the ribs it will stop. Pits won't. They keep going until the dog is dead. 

People always want to say it is just how you raise them. No. Every breed has a set of traits. A beagle will howl and sniff. A newfoundland will swim around you in the water. A greyhound will want to bolt after small animals. If this weren't the case breeding would be pointless. They aren't dog aggressive because people fight them. People fight them because they're dog aggressive. ",8

"On Christmas Day Dexter had been throwing up constantly. I had seen fake Christmas tree needles in his vomit, and figured he had eaten some of the Christmas tree. Because it was Christmas, I took him into the vet the next day. The vet took X-rays, did a blood test, and a test for pancreatitis. The pancreatitis test came back positive and they couldn't find anything on the X-rays. They mentioned they would send the X-rays out to a specialist to see if there was a foreign body. The vet sent me home with antibiotics and told me to syringe feed him. A vet tech called Sunday to see how he was doing, and he was doing fine at that time. That night he started vomiting again.

I took him back into the vet Monday morning. They then informed me that he had a foreign body in his intestines, and seemed perplexed that I had no knowledge of their findings. They took another X-ray and commented that it looked like it was moving nicely through his intestines. So to help it move they gave him IV fluids all day at the vet. I took him home and they told me if he started to vomit again to take him to the emergency vet, if not to bring him back in the morning for more X-rays and fluids.

Tuesday he received fluids again all day to help him pass this foreign body. Again, they told me to take him home and watch for vomiting. Hopefully he would pass it that night.

Wednesday comes around, he still has not pooped and he is seeming a lot worse. The vet takes more X-rays and determines it is not moving and he needs to see a specialist. She gives me four options: take him in for surgery, do an ultrasound at the specialist, wait to see what happens, or do a barium study at their office. I elect to go to the specialist. Thank god I did, because not 5 minutes in the specialists office they determined that there was a string tied around Dexter's tongue. He went in for emergency surgery. Since the string made it all the way to his colon, it was taught and cutting into his intestines. The surgeons had to remove 25% of his small intestines and said that the string cut into the intestines so badly it might have gone through it. They sewed him up as best as they could. It is now a waiting game to see if his intestines will leak. They said they wouldn't know until 3 - 5 days after surgery.

All of this could have been avoided had my vet done a proper examination of my cat, or told me on Sunday that it was a foreign body. Instead the vet HELPED the string go through his intestines. I'm beyond upset over this whole thing, but at least he is in better hands now. He won't be able to come home until Monday or Tuesday because he's in the ICU at the pet hospital. We visited him today and he seemed a lot better than he did with the string in him.",4

"The breed itself isn't bad. It's the overwhelming popularity of the breed + consumer ignorance on breeding habits + people looking to make a quick buck that bother folk. It's mostly the breeders that are the issue. 

Because doodles are mutts, there's no standard for breeding (ie a list of things all the parents and puppies should exhibit). Breeding a mix doesn't mean  mixing blue and red to get purple. It means you're getting anything between blue and red, which are shades of purple but not the same shade in every batch. Standards mean you're always getting the same shade of purple. Unfortunately the only way you can get to a standard is by making lots and lots and lots of puppies and interbreeding them, and killing or dumping the ones that don't fit. Making a new breed is fairly unethical at this point. 

The lack of standard also means a lack of a regulated breeding club. Breeder clubs are a good way to rule out puppy mills, profit breeders and backyard breeders, who are the main contributors to dog overbreeding and therefore not people you want to support. 

There's also the health issue - mutts of vastly different breeds have a lower chance of hereditary illness for sure, but the mutt health myth is one of the reasons doodles are popular, and it's wrong. Poodles and retrievers share a lot of the same illnesses, which means the puppies can be just as messed up as an inbred showdog because it's chances are just as high. Because there's no regulation, someone can just buy a sick poodle and a sick golden and make some sick puppies. That's possible with every breed, but the doodle breeders are selling these sick pups for 2-4K because of the 'name brand'

Basically: people who breed goldendoodles are doing it for high profits and getting away with it because the people buying simply aren't informed on dog breeding habits and ethics. It results in a lot of dog owners getting ripped off, and is contributing to dog overpopulation. There are plenty of existing breeds that are just as good as the doodle that are hypoallergenic, cute, smart, and less expensive with a better guarantee of health. 

I don't feel any ill will to doodle owners, but the breeders are shady as fuck. ",8

Also as a note, if you find yourself in a situation where you have to separate two fighting dogs, the easiest and safest way to do it is do get one of the dogs by the hind legs, lift them up and back away. The dog can't turn around and bite you and it won't be able to carry on fighting the other dog because it's balance will be gone.(think of it as getting a boxer to fight standing on one leg). Then hopefully the other dog's owner can come and take theirs away from the fight or if they're not around, you can leash one of them to a pole or something and then get the other one under control.

"Anyway, a quick search of the literature:

Aggressive Behavior of Dogs Kept As Companion Animals: Classification and Influence of Sex, Reproductive Status and Breed by Peter L. Borchelt:

&gt;It is clear from the present data that more aggression occurs in male than in female dogs. Overall, about Z/3 of the instances of aggression occurred in males. This is in contrast to the virtual equality in the sex incidence among the cases of non-aggressive behavior problems.[...]

&gt;Generally, the types of aggression which are the most sexually dimorphic occur in the context of reproductive behavior. Thus, inter-male aggression in many species is correlated with seasonal changes in androgens, is first exhibited when androgen levels rise during puberty, and is correlated with adult baseline levels of androgens. Dominance-related aggression is also correlated with adult baseline levels of androgens (Leshner, 1978).

Management and Rehabilitation of Inter-Dog Aggression In Animal Shelters by Jane S. Orihel (I'm citing her lit review):

&gt;Inter-dog aggression often occurs between dogs of the same sex, but it is more prevalent among males (Voith, 1980; Beaver, 1983; Borchelt, 1983; Hart and Hart, 1985; Sherman et al., 1996; Roll and Unshelm, 1997).

&gt;For household aggression, treatment often consists of stabilizing the social hierarchy by reinforcing the status of higher-ranking dogs and reducing the privileges of lower-ranking dogs (Sherman et al., 1996; Juarbe-Díaz, 1997; Overall, 1997). 


Characteristics, Treatment, and Outcome of 99 Cases of Aggression Between Dogs by Cynthia Kagarise Sherman, Ilana R. Reisnerb, Lecreca A. Taliaferroc, Katherine A. Houptb

&gt; For household aggression, same-sex pairs, especially females, were far more numerous than opposite-sex pairs (P &lt; 0.001).
*(Note: author found fights between female pairs more injurious than between male pairs, though results were non-significant.)*",1

Same with spins. If you do a 180, 360, etc. and let's say your ""regular footed"" (when you're moving, your right foot is on the back ""tail"" of the board and your left foot is in front), if you spin to the right, or clockwise, it would cause your back to be facing the direction in which you are moving, which would be a ""backside 180, 360, etc."" Oppositely, if you spin to the left, or counter-clockwise, so that your chest faces the direction in which you are moving, this is called a ""frontside 180, 360, etc.""

The wood chips most people use as bedding is bad for their lungs, so you have to either put them on Carefresh (expensive) or fleece (time consuming to change), and spot clean daily.

"Given how many millions of homes have dogs, incidents are pretty rare. My older dog, a 8 year old boxer, I would and do trust with any child.

He once got attacked by a cat while on a walk, and didn't growl or even bark at the cat, and I had to pull that cat off him, and its claws broke off in his snout. (And that cats owner yelled at me?) 

But my fox hound will definitely let you know if your pissing him off. So the kids grew up knowing it was okay to play with one, but the other they only played with when *he* initiated play.

"This is the go to treatment for a flea infestation in smaller animals in shelters. It's quick and very effective (sometimes more so than a real flea shampoo). It's also cheaper, which means a lot to many places. 

That said, a whole lot of soap isn't needed. A small dab will do, but it must be spread around (you can add water to help). It doesn't have to be a bubble bath - remember, it's a dish soap, so it doesn't take a lot to make a lather and spread around. 

It must be throughly rinsed, making sure to not get water in the ears, eyes, and especially the nose or mouth. If fleas are present in these areas, it's best to rub your finger on the already lathered body and then gently touch/massage these areas just enough to have some bubbles touch the fleas. Then, wet your finger and wipe away.

He's hilarious though. I have some feral cats that live outside that attack anything that gets near them, including my dogs unfortunately. My husky and the retriever are both terrified of them all. The wiener on the other hand? That little bastard is the most confident dog in the world. I swear, it's like he thinks a large pit-bull or something, he'll just run up to the other cats, and he'll act like the aggressor. Funny as hell how my big dogs run away from these cats while the cats run away from my little wiener. At least he's good at killing moles.

I know I won't be able to convince you on the Internet, and this will probably just piss you off, but seriously no one is getting paid to tell people vaccines are good. They don't have to, people are spreading that shit around like butter on bread on their own. They do it cause they don't want their children getting sick from horrible diseases that have cures already. They've been irradicated and now people are getting sick from them again because people won't vaccinate their children. If you're arguing vaccines don't work which you calling them ""pseudoscience""  leads me to believe then you're just an imbecile. They obviously worked or We'd still have these diseases going around, and let's say they have a 10% chance of causing autism. They don't but for the sake of argument let's say they do. Isn't it better to get a vaccine and become immune to diseases that could kill you, than gain a little chance of autism? Basically you're saying you'd rather let your child die of a disease, then have to take care of an autistic child. Plenty of autistic children are functional, but no dead children are. 

Ps there are much more eloquent people that could have made this argument, and probably could have made it better than me. I don't know all the info so correct me if I'm wrong about something, but please provide a valid source if you do. ",2

"The simple answer is evolution.

These animals are born ""imprinted"" with a lot of useful information. For example in nature, a foal or calf would need to walk on their own in a matter of hours after birth, because the herd moves on, and predators lurk. Not just walk, but keep up.

This has been evolved because the ones who did not walk fast enough were killed off.

Humans on the other hand are crafty. They can protect and hide away their young for months and years until they can fend for them selves, so humans and human relatives never evolved the same way.

The plus side is that the trade-off for being born ""blank"" and slow for humans  is an unique ability to reason and learn :)",37

"Here's the thing. You said ""that was a tad unnecessary.""

Is it unnecessary? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies necessities, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one says that is a tad unnecessary. If you want to be ""a tad"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""a tad unnecessary"" you're referring to the linguistic grouping of tadidae, which includes things from tadpoles to Thaddeuses to tandrills.

So your reasoning for calling a necessity a tad unnecessary is because random people ""call the necessary-like ones a tad unnecessary?"" Let's get Teds and Todds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A necessity is a necessity and a member of the necessities family. But that's not what you said. You said a necessity is a tad unnecessary, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the necessity family unnecessary, which means you'd call toodles, toddies, and other tads tads, too. Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?",1

Because no one else was around it played out as this really intense and intimate experience where I was closely interacting with another creature's mind.

"Speaking from personal experience - Get another one. I lost [my first dog, Cash](http://i.imgur.com/sqLew8k.jpg), eleven months after I got him to cancer, and holy fuck did it feel like life ripped out my heart, stomped on it, shit on it, spat on it, then put it back. The only time I felt pain that bad was when my two year old cat died when I was eleven (genetic liver problems, his liver failed and we couldn't save him).


Within four weeks I had a puppy. And holy crap was she the best decision I ever made in my life! The joy that she brought and the companionship made Cash's passing a lot easier to deal with. She gave me something to do in the morning, gave me something to focus on instead of feeling hurt and lonely all the time.


I'd literally come home from college and would just cry, and I wouldn't stop because I missed Cash so much. But once [Juno, my puppy](http://i.imgur.com/Mh0ot7T.jpg?1), came into my life, the crying became less and less, and I laughed a lot more. She's going to be four in March and is the light of my life. I know it will almost kill me when she passes, but I know I'll just do the same thing - Bring home another dog because my heart has room to fill with more and more dogs.

"Don't get an Epi-Pen.  See your Vet.  They can prescribe a 'dog' sized syringe with a charge of epinephrine.  You can carry this with you (keep) in an insulated container with say, an ice pack, if your dog is actually allergic to bee venom.
Epi Pens by design are  to be injected in a human sized thigh.  The needle will basically most likely go right thru your dog.
The usual place to inject your dog is in the back of the neck/shoulders area by 'tenting' the skin.

"Our baby jumped out of a window we had open when our heat wasn't working. We didn't know the screen was only half attached to the frame at the time. Apparently she instantly realized her mistake and after failing to jump back in, she sat in our front flower bed and yowled for a few hours before one of us woke up and realized she wasn't inside. She bolted in as soon as the door opened. Apparently some can learn their lesson.

She also just slipped out the front door about a month after we adopted her and neither of us where home. My roommate left at 6pm or so and I was the first to come home around 10pm. See a cat in my yard (it was dark) and thought nothing of it. Until she ran up to me and luckily we had a bell on her because our house was big and old. Only thing that kept me from assuming it was just some cat was that bell. Wouldn't have looked twice otherwise.",3

The end of your fingertips are *not* ""vestigial"", which implies you have literally no use for/of them. 

Similarly, the ends of cats paws are **not** ""vestigial""; ""declawing"" is cutting off the last knuckle on each ""finger"", which not only removes the fingernails but also alters the way they walk and balance themselves and, in bad cases, exposes the ends of their paws to pain, which is why some cats start refusing to use the litter box (scented/chemical-based litters).

OTOH, surely you know that human males and females have been ""fixed"" as well, right? And that it doesn't involve castration in men?

My male cat's been fixed but he's not missing any parts; these days, vets are likely to do the same thing they do to human males. Also, he couldn't care less b/c he a f--king **cat**, so his ego isn't exactly at play here.",5

I lost one to cancer when she was 17 and it made me sick.  I didn't want another cat.  Though some cats just showed up at my place and I took them in.

The one I lost was a real sweetie, always loved being on a lap and very affectionate.

I had no idea that a feral little black kitten would show up one day.  He was 4-5 weeks old and terrified of everyone.  I have no idea what happened to his mom.  I leave food and water out for other ferals, so he had that.  He moved into the utility room, so he had a safe, dry place to sleep.

I started tossing kitty treats to him.  He eventually came around.  These days he's a cuddleslut.  Totally shameless about wanting attention and he's usually on my shoulder whenever I'm on the sofa.

My point is that I'd never have had this little black guy on my shoulder if I had made the one who died my last cat.  I got lots of love from her then, and lots of love from this guy now.  ",0

Imagine if someone took a blade or a lazer and cut or burned off the top joint of your fingers. All ten. Not just the fingernail, but the entire top portion of each finger down to the first spot where it can bend.

Venom was a plot device that allowed writers to destroy any subtlety in the character and now he's just portrayed as a dumb brute drug addict.

What possible reason could you have for wanting Venom to be in the film? What does it add to the film that wasn't already in there?

"It's a wonderful thing to grow up with a canine companion but under no circumstances should your sister allow her children to sit on/hang on the dog like that. They may be best of buddies but children should be taught to interact gently and respectfully with dogs. This is how bites that seemingly come out of nowhere happen.

""He doesn't even mind getting dressed up as a pretty princess.""
His body language indicates otherwise. The half moon eye and the tongue flick are tell-tale signs of canine discomfort. This particular dog may never ever snap at your niece but he's clearly distressed. Even if he's too passive to react otherwise your nieces might not be so lucky with another dog. It's crucial to understand a bit about doggie body language to prevent tragedies before they happen. Unfortunately this information doesn't seem to be widely circulated so oftentimes the warning signs are missed and accidents happen. I've heard stories of dogs biting children seemingly out of nowhere and people can't understand how their wonderful dog did such a thing out of the blue. As friendly and well socialized as they come, dogs are still animals that lack human sensibility and reasoning and they will react to discomfort in a canine capacity.

The Germans are generally ok with ignoring sexual assault that happens at their festivals. There are ten police reported rapes per year at Oktoberfest and an estimated 200 that aren't reported to police. German laws require a woman to prove that she fought back hard enough in order to convict someone of rape. Marital rape was legal there until 1997. Assaults just don't make big news like this one did because immigrants are being blamed for it this time.,10

Declawing is done purely for the owner's convenience, is analogous to removing the top third of all of a person's fingers, and cripples a body part that even an indoor cat needs to use every day to walk, climb, and dig in its litter. It can also cause chronic pain. There are many reasons to support spaying/neutering while opposing declawing.

Peak output for a horse is like 14-15 hp so around 11kW. So 4 are like 44 kW. That's not bad at all and well above some smaller tractors. [like this one for example](http://www.tractordata.com/farm-tractors/005/7/9/5791-john-deere-5055e.html). For reference a human cyclist can achieve an output of 400 Watts for about an hour and heavy workers can average around 75 Watts over 8 hours according to this [Link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_power) Since one horsepower is the power a horse is able to deliver constnatly and one horse power is ~ 750 Watt a horse can deliver around 10 times the power a human can.,173

"That is correct.  What the common dog owner doesn't understand is the effort that goes into establishing a stud book.  The AKC is nothing more than a business and they have proven on many different occasions their inability to truly protect the integrity of a breed.  ONLY when parent clubs petition on behalf of their standards has the AKC ever corrected wrong-doing.  The LRC was unable to provide a sufficient argument in the elementary stages of this dilute fad, and now the AKC has allowed too many false registrations to correct the issue until a new breed is established and those who continue to insist on calling them labrador retrievers can be shunned by both retriever owners and the dilute breed.  As a lab breeder and trainer, I've worked with several ""silvers"" and although I've never had great success, they certainly haven't been my worst clients either.  As a dog they have merit for those interested in such characteristics, but it's not my personal preference.  I just don't want to bastardize the labrador retriever any more than necessary, which includes back yard labs just as well as silvers.  The silvers are just red-headed step children, because they display the disqualifying characteristics physically.  There are so many labs that are bred simply because Joe has fido and he knows Jim's dog Penny is coming into heat and they breed them...

I'm a purist, and I breed only to potentially improve on all traits a dog demonstrates, and I try to make pairings to improve any weaknesses.  I've never come across a silver supporter who had that interest in the breed, but rather simply want a dog that's silver in color...  

Dilutes are here to stay.  I'm okay with that, but I wish they would be happy to call them something other than a lab.  I don't go around claiming to have a St. John's Water Dog",1

"Lions are social cats and may form bonds with their keepers. Most wild cats are not very social so they're a bit different. Even still, the same applies. Turning your back may trigger them to pounce. Even if at first this pounce is playful, there instincts can take over and they may kill without understanding what they're doing. Again, they are wild animals and are unpredictable. Their instincts have not been bred out of them and because they are huge and powerful it's really not hard for them to do a lot of damage.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwIG0Azev_w) the lion was merely playing. If the owners hadn't intervened, it could have gotten way out of hand. Imagine if this man was alone with the lion.

[Here](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19781025&amp;id=YjYeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Nr8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5884,3643743&amp;hl=en) is an example of an owner being killed because her back was turned and she was alone. The lion was most probably just playing, at least at first.

[Here's a shitty video compilation I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU9pkFsdYpg) of lions turning on their handlers seemingly without warning.

[NSFL](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=be6_1362108572) footage of two lions turning on their handler simply because it was feeding time, they were excited, and the owner fell over. Again, instincts kicking in.

[NSFL](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=772_1327773867) footage of a lion killing its handler. This is what happens to the lions after the fact. This is why experts hate this shit, because not only are the handlers risking their own lives, they're risking the lives of the animals.

These incidence are so common that there is no shortage of video evidence for it. Keep in mind, I only posted incidences involving lions specifically. The bottom line is that they are wild animals and I can't emphasize this enough. They don't fully understand what they're doing. They have no concept of death or pain when it comes to others and have instincts that they follow blindly. They're just doing what they do. It's the same shit over and over again. People think because they know the animals, that they have a social bond, that they can interact with them like they do with their domesticated house pets. They don't listen to the warnings. It's human hubris at its worst.

"&gt;Overall the Tamaskan breed is healthy with only a few notable health issues, which affect a small percentage of the bloodlines to date. Roughly 10% of males suffer from cryptorchidism: undescended testes. With these cases, usually only one testicle fully descends within the scrotum, while the other testicle remains ""hidden"" up within the abdominal cavity. Epilepsy has been diagnosed in five dogs, affecting about 1 out of every 100 registered Tamaskan worldwide. Several dogs have been found to be carriers of degenerative myelopathy. As with all large breed dogs, hip dysplasia is a risk.

"I'm glad you said this. I'm a hedgehog lover and I am very dismayed about their continual growth in popularity. People who are not prepared to care for them properly are buying them. Hedgehogs are being abused and neglected because of their ""cute"" factor. When really they are not a pet that all kinds of people will like. 

Not to mention that now more and more pet stores are selling them. These hedgehogs are often inbred. They are often mistreated. They are not cared for properly and then proper instruction isn't given upon sale. They are not housed correctly. They are given toys which are dangerous to them. The list just goes on and on. And unwhitting people who ""saw a cute picture"" go and purchase them and perpetuate the circle. The pet store sees they sell well so ""Hey! Let's get more!"" 

And it makes me sad. Hedgehogs can be wonderful. But it takes a specific kind of person to enjoy their company. Do not go in expecting snuggles or cute looks all the time. In more cases than not all you will get are bites, pricks from quills and a huffy puffy angry ball of hate. They also require daily handling if you ever hope to have them be friendly. And even that isn't a sure fire bet. 

I just....I'm glad that you pointed out that eventhough everyone talks about how cute they are and wants to get one, they can be very angry pets. They can be very bad pets for certain people. 

Please Please PLEASE do not just go buy a hedgehog because you see a cute picture on the internet. It's a living being and it requires certain care. If you are not prepared to give that care or do the proper research, please find another pet. And even then, please research THAT pet and make sure you can for it. ",27

"Your dog must be the spiritual brother of my dog. There is a lake near my house that I walk my dogs around and one of them loves to jump in the lake and swim out to the ducks. The ducks have gotten so used to him, they just sit there now and let him swim up, sniff them a bit, and then swim back. The rest of the walk, he'll continue to rotate between jumping in the lake, and rolling around in the mud on the edge. By the time he's done, he's absolutely filthy and I have to give him a bath. The damn dog loves doing it so much though, I don't have the heart to stop him.

Oh and he also loves the hose. If he sees me even near a hose, he'll freak out and get excited. I can spray him for hours and he'll just run around happy as can be, getting super muddy and trying to ""catch"" the water. The funny thing is, my other dog, his brother and litter mate, absolutely despises water. He hears the hose and instantly runs to the door to let me know he wants to go in. Whenever I run the tub for their bath, he'll literally hide in random spots around the house and make me find him. He's a little mini-dachshund so it can be pretty tricky to find the little smart-ass sometimes. I love them both to death though and wouldn't trade either one for anything in the world.",1

"I think my mindset is that these are still wild animals. To raise from a tiny baby is one thing, but people can forget they're wild.

They do have different dispositions, but it's only apparent when they're under stress. Since I really only see them when they're stressed/not feeling well, it's more apparent to me. The one from the wild reverts much more quickly to biting and otherwise defending herself - which is totally fine because we're aware of her nature and the fact that she is technically a wild animal. Too many pet owners forget that.
They're both absolute love bugs otherwise though. Skunks are very chill for wild animals, I want one so bad.

Both are practices that the individual won't really remember afterwards or care. Both have been proven to be harmful and unnecessary tactics. I think both of these are wrong but I'm not gonna yell at mothers for abusing their kids because they got them circumcised.  You challenge the system and help educate those who don't know any better.

"Tell me, what happens in a force diagram when you try to jump? You force your muscles to exert pressure on the ground and you push off right? All of your energy is exerted in the down direction to go up. Newton's third law says for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Since the mass of the earth is so much larger than you, the force you exert on it is inconsequential, but it still pushes back on you with equal force on your mass causing you to push off briefly. 


[This](http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/age16-19/Medical%20physics/text/Walking_/index.html)
&gt; The reason that the vertical forces are greater in walking and running than they are when you are standing still is that in standing the vertical force has just to balance your weight. However in walking, and to a more extreme case in running, the force has to support your weight and produce a change of momentum as you land, changing the downward motion to an upward motion for the following stride. In walking this force would be up to 1.5 times your body weight while in running it might increase to between 2.0 and 2.9 times your body weight! 

And

[the end of this article both say the same thing about running.](http://www.multisportcanada.com/tri/cody-beals-how-much-easier-are-treadmills/)

&gt; The starting point for any dynamics problem like this is a diagram of forces, called a free body diagram. We’re going to consider a runner moving at constant speed acted on by three external forces: the force of gravity (aka weight), the aerodynamic drag force (aka air resistance) and the ground reaction force. The force of gravity is constant and we’ll assume that drag is also approximately constant. However, the ground reaction varies throughout the gait cycle.

Notice how in both cases, there is only one force that points in the direction of movement...The normal force, also called the normal reaction or ground reaction force. All mean the same thing; the earth is pushing back--equal and opposite.  


Maybe a different scenario would help. Imagine there is no earth, you're just floating along in space in a suit. You make the motions to run but instead go nowhere. Why? Nothing to push off of. There is nothing to provide a 3rd law reaction. The simple act of moving your muscles is only half of the requirement of movement. ",1

I don't remember that but I do remember not wanting to be in a high chair at all. A lot scarred me emotionally and I think that's why I have such a huge chain of problems. I just found out I was adopted about 3 years ago, and I'm 18 right now. They said they would've never told me if they had the choice but I asked questions and they kind of had to. So it's been a very very complicated journey. I can't say I can compare one set of parents to the other because since I was adopted I've never physically spoken to either of my birthparents. I've messaged my mom a lot but never spoken to her.

That generally happens with kittens. I raised more than my fair share of litters and when they begin to open there eyes they are blue. As they mature they almost always change to like a green or yellow. They will be about four or five weeks old when you see the eye color has shifted. Kittens usually open there eyes about a week or so after birth -- varies by kitten. I assume they are all usually the same color because of the eye developing.,2

"When I was younger I was out on the river with my brothers and a few friends. I had grown up on the river and this gave me a false sense of security. I decided to walk towards the front of the pontoon boat and act like it was the great Titanic. My friend decided to join in the action and create a great looking Jack and Jack on a shitty Titanic. A boat crosses in front of us a ways up and my brother slows the boat down a bit to avoid the waves. When he slows the engine my friend and I rock forward losing our balance. The railing at the front of the boat gives away and I know we are going in.

It was a split second decision but I immediately contorted my body into a dive and sank as far down as possible. I knew that the boat was going to run me over and swimming as deep as possible was the only viable solution. My friend hesitated, turned around, and grabbed onto the front of the railing to hold one. He was hanging off the front of the boat. My brother was in complete shock and didn't think to switch the engine into neutral. My friend lost his grip and the boat went over him. 

While I was underwater I realized that the boat was probably above my head so I decided to swim perpendicular to the boat. I eventually surfaced a good distance from the boat. 

You would think this story is over, but it is not. When I surfaced I immediately started looking for my friend and eventually saw him surface behind the boat. My brother was still in complete shock and was worried about running us over, not realizing that the boat had already done that. He placed the boat in reverse and proceed to back over my friend. 

At this point I assumed my friend was dead and I started swimming towards the boat yelling at my brother to cut the engine. I start looking around the water for a body and was relieved and surprised when my friend popped out of the water right next to me. 

My friend had superficial wounds all the way up his back from the initial pull through the boat and 4 large gashes on the side of his arm from the second impact. We were able to stabilize him on the boat and place him on the jetski for the nearest boat dock (about 10 mins away).

"I've owned 2 cats that have been declawed before I learned of negative stories of declawing, one of those cats is still with us.
Our first cat I was to young to remember when it was declawed, but it never showed any signs of pain.
Likewise the cat we have now was declawed as a kitten and while the vet told us to keep it from being to active for 2 weeks, we was up and running around like his normal self the next day (we tried settle him down, but he's an insane cat.)  He still has amazing grip with his front paws despite being declawed and will make 6'+ vertical leaps and catch the shelf with his paws and pull himself up the rest of the way, again no signs of pain or anything.

"To anyone thinking 'Hey! That looks like loads of fun, I want a squirrel!'

The only reason I kept him is because there are zero shelters that take baby squirrels in where I live, and I would think twice before doing this again.

It takes a lot of hard work and dedication. It is basically the same as raising a child. My home wasn't mine anymore, and poop was just an all the time thing. Poop on my hair, poop on my back, people at work would be like 'you have... uhm... brown stuff on your shoulder.' Let's not talk about the surprising amount of pee a squirrel can produce. Feeding every four hours, stimulating for bowel movements, weening, balanced diets...

The constant [gnawing](http://imgur.com/uH4V0vN) on all of my belongings. He [really](http://imgur.com/IMzlnbL) wanted the inside of our cupboard.
I wanted to do this well, I wanted this squirrel to be happy. My home became a [tree](http://imgur.com/TwcAsQk).

I do love him and I don't regret any of it, and I am REALLY proud of what we managed to accomplish, he is truly thriving, but, with the knowledge I have about it, an apartment is not the ideal place to raise a squirrel. It was too difficult, and I would only do this again if I lived in the country.

Also, the first thing to do if you find a squirrel is NOT to tell yourself 'omigosh, I must save him and bring him home!' most of the time, the mother will come back for it, and you need to focus your efforts on this before making any other decision!

That is all :)",13

"One day, this stray, adult cat, moved in and stayed with me.

I tried to give him away,but no one wanted an adult cat.  I didn't want one either, but I didn't want to take him to be killed at a shelter.

Fast forward 19 years. He had been my one constant, through countless girlfriends, a couple of house moves, and even curled up with me through some bad times here and there, including some illnesses.  Finally, it was his turn to be sick and he lost so much weight, he had to sleep under the covers with me, curled up in my arm.

On his last day on earth, he became unable to move, his kidneys were unable to filter the water from his blood and so he literally couldn't move his muscles. He jumped off the bed and just lay there.  I put him on the bed and laid next to him, and he used all his strength to reach one paw out to touch me.

I lost my best friend that day.  I'll never forget him trying to reach out to me one last time.",59

"She does have that kinda forehead so possible and they went with beagle mix because 'pitt' anything is a 'oh shit' thing. If she is part pitt she'll be high energy, very loyal to family, and be a bit too smart for her own good.

My father ran around the house with it, the quail angrily chasing him for stealing its lover.",96

SO i decided to do what you do with your dog. Made the bath a slight above lukewarm and brought him over, I got in, and put him in. He freaked for only a second and then realized i was in it with him and actually let me wash him! Was so nice to be able to wash my pup without him acting like i was trying to kill him! Granted i had to take a shower after, but well worth it! (He still freaked out when he realized he was wet. Wait till i make him go in the ocean)

"&gt; Why don't people want to adopt black cats? I'd adopt Anubis in a heartbeat.

If not Anubis, you will have no trouble finding another black cat at the local shelter. 

Animal behaviorist Temple Grandin wrote in a book that black cats are genetically more sociable than other coat colors.  She has studies to back that up.  Black cats tend to get along better with other cats and humans than other coat colors.

Which is why it's so tragic that black cats are the least likely to be adopted.  Even shelter workers talk about ""laid back black cats"" and say that they're usually the easiest to work with.

If you want a friendly, sociable cat, adopt a black one.  Black cats make fantastic pets.

Full disclosure: I'm really biased here.  I share my home with three male black cats.  (There's a gray tabby girl, too.)  These guys are relaxed, personable, friendly, affectionate, and all-around great pets.  My first black cat had been dumped in a parking lot.  He was friendly from the start, calmly got in my car, purred on my lap all the way home, then walked into my place like he had always lived there.

The other two were found as feral kittens, a few months apart.  Both of them socialized and became loving lapcats.  One of them is a shoulder cat.

So if you're looking for a cat with a great personality, think about a black one.

(I should add that my tabby girl is wonderful, too.)",8

He could not have been outside for more than 10 minutes when he was hit.  They tried to get one from a shelter for $200 but since they don't have a fence and their previous dog was hit by a car they would not sell to them...I'm pretty sure my parents don't throw their pets at traffic...,1

Nucleosythesist scientist? Do you mean nucleosynthesist? Because that's a process that uses protons and neutrons to create new atomic nuclei, like in the big bang. Nothing to do with biology/genetics.

Myglomia? The only google result for that is this post.  

If the cat is a female, it's going to inheret one X chromosome from each parent. If it's a male, Y from the father and X from the mother.  Usually one of the X chromosomes in a female will be randomly and independently inactivated (X-inactivation or lyonization) in each of the cells of the inner cell mass.  

I'm not sure what this process is, unfortunately this isn't my area of expertise. Hopefully someone more well versed in genetics will notice the cat's interesting phenotype and feel compelled to educate us.",21

"I honestly just don't understand how people are so confident in trusting young children with animals. As a five year old, I broke my cats leg (on accident of course) because I wanted to see if cats could land not on their feet and I was five, so I really didn't fully understand the concept that it was a living, breathing animal that could be injured so easily. Cats don't break their legs in cartoons, so it didn't occur to me that it was possibility in real life. 17 years later, the cat is still going strong, and I still feel truly horrible about the incident. Obviously that is not a typical thing to happen, but there are so many variables with really young children, it doesn't seem worth the risk.

Also, given the average life spans of dogs, having a dog while your child is a baby is just asking for it to pass when they are too young to understand it but old enough to be traumatized by it. I guess some people might see this as silly, because a child might have to deal with loss at any point in time, but this is my other main motivation for waiting my kids are not too young to get a family pet/dog when I eventually have children and a dog.

Mostly, these issues aren't the dog's fault. They are going to chew, or burrow or do something like that. The goal is that they have something that's OK to chew on and has their energy directed away from the couch and onto a chew toy or a game or a walk.

"The ""Nucelosythesist"" guy everyone is upvoting is talking out of his ass. Molecular Geneticist here (which is actually a title relating to genetics, unlike ""Nucleosythesist""). 

Venus is just a particularly striking example of an ordinary Calico cat. She (as a female cat) inherited one X chromosome from her father and one X chromosome from her mother. Like in humans, in each cell of an early stage blastocyst, *one* of these X chromosomes is randomly selected to be expressed; the other is ""shrivelled"" up into what's termed a Barr body, inactivating it.

The cells then continue to divide, with each cell's daughter cells expressing the same X chromosome as it's parent, resulting in different regions of an organism's body expressing different X chromosomes. Since in cats, the hair (and evidently eye) color gene is carried on the X chromosome, different regions of the cat become different colors, resulting in this ""calico"" pattern.

Venus just got particularly lucky in that the blastocyst cells which would grow into her face divided differently in a bilateral fashion, leading to her extremely distinct and striking look.

As a fun fact, the exact same mechanism of X chromosome inactivation occurs in human females, but our skin color gene is not carried on this chromosome, meaning we don't have calico coloration on our skin. I believe some sweat gland related genes are carried on X chromosomes, however, meaning that some regions of human females' skin will have more or fewer sweat glands. So if any ladies out there ever wondered why a section of your arm sweats a lot but another section doesn't... This is why.

P.S. Just goes to show, don't believe everything you read online. A simple google of Nucleosynthesis tells me that it is a physics process relating to nuclei of atoms. Googling myglomia yields only this thread as a result... It's entirely a made up word.",64

It sounds weird, its hard to explain. But from that day forward I never touched beef again. Its been about two years now. I still eat chicken but maybe one day I'll lose my taste for that too. 

I say all that to say that maybe everyone doesn't become a vegetarian because they made a decision to. Maybe some people just lose their desire for meat naturally over time which probably makes it easier. You can know how delicious something is but have no urge to eat it.

I can tell you've never worked on a farm.

&gt; are incidental to the process

No, they're a direct result of the farming practices you support with your lifestyle. You can close your eyes and plug your ears all you like but the fact remains, for sheer convenience, you support farming practices which result in the deaths of millions of animals.

You are purposely and wantonly taking those lives because of your desire for convenience and to bow at the altar of 'optimum health'. Despite the fact you're completely capable of surviving by eating food you grow.

&gt;Causing as little harm as possible is clearly more moral than otherwise

It sure is. Let me know when you do that. Because right now, you do cause unnecessary harm to millions of animals.

Just because you don't (knowingly) ingest the animals your lifestyle kills, doesn't make you any less responsible for their deaths. In fact it's more-wasteful than hunting only one or two animals a year to feed a family",2

Jobs were literally asking for a degree and 5 years experience, which no college grad had. All we had was the degree. So what happened? We were forced in entry level positions that were hardly matching our skills. Now, don't get me wrong, I a woman that believes in starting at the bottom and moving up to learn the pace of the business and understanding the company and its departments, but that's not what happened to us.

"&gt; After owning a husky, I really do feel they are the cats of the dog world.

After living with two huskies and doing plenty of research on them, I have to say you guys are definitely in the minority. Huskies are known to be particularly hyperactive and exhausting in general. A lot of people get them because they're beautiful dogs, but quickly find out this is the case unless they've been extensively trained beforehand.

watch the dogs body language, especially when the kid starts crawling around. do the scent familiarity like someone else suggested. make sure the dog knows that the baby has its space. i personally wouldn't let the dog go into the babies room... make it a safe space for the baby, same with play areas",1

When all was said and done I peeled the meat off it so he could have his floor chicken.

The second time however I made a dish and it had some hot peppers in it. The total dumbass tried again and got himself a pepper. I was about to chase him and thought, nah, this will sort itself out. He was about to run when he saw I gave up, so he hunkered down all proud of himself and bit right into it.

"Spaying and neutering helps reduce the chance of cancer in the reproductive areas, can help curb violence/ agression/ dominance behaviors, and save you money in the long run (less destructive behavior, which can be destruction of property/ biting, and the aforementioned cancer possibility, saves on potential vet medical bills, and human medical bills due to attacks.)

Not to be rude about it, but the first article is misleading in it's cited material. The reference number 5 used in the article links to a study for Osteosarcoma in dogs, in relation to increasing height and weight, with a footnote indicating that neutered dogs have an ""observed"" increase. The citation piece did not indicate that neutering was the factor that doubled the chances, just that it was observed to be the case within the dogs who were in the study.

Larger dogs seem to have a higher chance of being neutered to begin with, as big dogs are more destructive and any violent outbursts have larger consequences when compared to a small breed such as a Miniature Poodle or Chihuahua. It's no surprise to me that larger dogs are neutered/ fixed more often for that very reason. 

It's like a study on skin cancer noting that redheads seemed to be more likely to get skin cancer, but the factors that are part of the study are things like sun exposure and sunscreen use. You would observe that redheads are more prone to it, but it's not a factor of the study directly.

Articles that are cited for 6 and 7 (more supposed ""studies"") seem to be missing or linked incorrectly. 

Total disclosure here, I did not read the PLOS article in it's entirety due to the lack of supporting data that is more than ""observed"" or coincidental. The data set used in gathering the information for this article is as low as 15 subjects.... 

&gt;Only diseases with at least 15 cases found using this screening were included in the study.

which is not a large enough sample size to properly associate a spay/neuter with increased chance of illness/ cancer. 

The Golden retriever studies doesn't factor in the [inbreeding increased cancer risk](http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask449) associated with the breed.

Also these links are about dogs specifically and do not speak to cats at all. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here are some articles I would like to put forth.

[Humane Society link.](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/why_spay_neuter.html?credit=web_id83581228#health)

[The USA Today article cited in the above link.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/07/pet-longevity-states-spay-neuter/2130813/)

Excerpt:     
&gt;Experts say states with the healthiest and longest living pets also have the highest neutering and spaying rates, more pets living inside and fewer regional infectious diseases.

[Banfield article mentioned in USA Today piece.](http://www.banfield.com/Banfield/media/PDF/Downloads/soph/Banfield-State-of-Pet-Health-Report_2013.pdf) This report contains data from 2.2 million dogs and 460,000 cats. There is a specific graph showing that spayed/neutered animals live longer than intact animals. I will admit right now that I believe this may be due to our spay and neuter culture around animals. The majority of household pets are spayed and neutered, and are therefore owned by people who care for them and take them to the vet. Intact animals are often homeless and may have shorter lifespans due to the number of dangers they face outdoors.",1

"&gt; That said the communication part wouldn't totally make sense, a dog with naturally erect ears could communicate better but a dog with unnaturally erect ears is thought to have limited communication ability by some animal behaviorist because the ears don't stand and move like a naturally erect ear would which could be misinterpreted and confusing to other dogs. &gt; 

Ahah that's very much possible thank you.
About the medical benefit's I'm not sure though, if it is not actually researched it remains arguable ofc, but it is been assumed that floppy ears (warmer and moistier environment) creates a better place for infections and parasites. I'll see if I can find anything on that part (I'm just very curious) That said I don't think cropping is the solution, many dogs have no issues. I honestly think we should just change the way we breed them and not go for traits we only remove later on (or just disfunctional stuff in general but that's a whole other discussion). However, floppy ears and white-patterns are an actual side-effect of breeding for a more 'domesticated' variant of a specie, might not be that easy....",1

Simple:
Desexing the cat has no long term side effect or complications.
Declawing can have instant complications, cause long term pain to the cat when it walks, can force him to walk differently, which is bad, can cause muscle pain, strain, etc...

This is according to studies.

Two of them got puppies around the same time babies were born and probably spent very little effort training them. Included in these particular sob stories were details about how the otherwise-lovable doggie bit their child (who I would bet was riding the dog like a horse) &amp; therefore can't be surrendered to a shelter because a biting history = unadoptable = put to sleep. I am a huge animal lover and reading these stories makes me so incredibly sad I can't even handle it.

The only thing I haven't tried yet is the double-sided tape, which we're going to attempt when we get a new sofa. 

I do keep his nails trimmed, but he still manages to do some damage with his stubs. And it's not like he has nothing else to scratch at, he just likes to cause us misery because he's an asshole.

"Yes. But the understanding thing is my question. It seems like stretch for the male to be reasoning, I have to kill her cubs if I want to get laid.

But what has been observed is when a male encroaches, it is females with cubs who band together to resist the new male, supporting the father of their cubs but mainly supporting their cubs whereas the females without cubs do not. (Maybe sometimes there is loyalty to their mate and their sisters/female friends.)

So it does seem like lionesses have some understanding of the situation. I would guess a lion is much smarter than a house cat in many respects. They hunt for a living and are able to choose from among prey animals, something house cats don't have to do.

I think in general we have over-estimated the role of instinct and under-estimated the role of intelligence among animals.",6

"Trufax: Veterinary fee schedules are fixed by [German Federal Law](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/got/BJNR169100999.html). A simple search on google.de within the past year returns several reports of a spay rolling in around 100-120 Euro.

&gt;""Bei Katern kostet eine unkomplizierte Kastration mindestens 60 Euro zuzüglich Mehrwertsteuer. Bei weiblichen Katzen kostet eine unkomplizierte Kastration mindestens 92 Euro zuzüglich Mehrwertsteuer"", so Dr. Theo Mantel, Präsident der Bundestierärztekammer, laut der Tierhilfe Leipzig Land. **Geregelt sind diese Kosten in der Gebührenordnung für Tierärzte (GOT).**
Die Kostenschwankungen ergeben sich unter anderem aus dem Gesundheitszustand des Tieres und möglichen weiteren notwendigen Untersuchungen. Auch die Art der Narkose und die verwendeten Materialien spielen eine Rolle. (emphasis mine, source http://www.t-online.de/lifestyle/tiere/haustiere/id_49596100/kastration-bei-katzen-diese-kosten-kommen-auf-sie-zu.html) 

German veterinarians are allowed to increase the cost of the procedure up to three times if the surgery were complicated, such as if the queen were in heat, pregnant or for some reason a poor candidate for surgery. In this case, the veterinarian still needs to submit paperwork to justify the increased expense. 

In Berlin I know there are low-cost spay and neuter programs available to pet owners, and there are even soup kitchens for pets. ",1

also, just so you know, almost all species of birds have an awful sense of smell - about as good as humans, if that tells you anything! - and a mother bird typically either can't tell or doesn't care if her baby has been touched by a person. that's an old wives' tale. if you find a baby bird, the best thing to do is put it back in the nest, or to put it in dense vegetation as close to the nest as you can reach. the parents will continue to to take care of it if you do, and will NOT abandon it. [here's some more information along those lines.](http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/faq/master_folder/attracting/challenges/orphaned); and [here's](http://birdandmoon.com/comic/found-a-baby-bird/) that information in a flowchart format.
