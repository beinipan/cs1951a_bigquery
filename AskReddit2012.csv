"&gt;Party loyalty? I'm not a democrat.

Yeah you are. You complained about Romney not explaining his policies when he was quite explicit and while President Obama didn't explain a single thing. You called a candidate ""full of shit"" and say things like ""Honestly, I couldn't care less about who won or lost."" regarding a debate that President Obama dramatically lost.

Yeah, you're a democrat and a dedicated one, and that's sort of obvious.

&gt;As far as Obama goes, it seemed as if he didn't take Romney seriously nor did he attack his claims very well.

Yeah, that's what it is, President Obama was just too cool to win the debate.

&gt;I honestly don't feel that either side did much of anything to attack their opponent's policies.

Right, Romney used the debate as a forum to present his policies and openly challenge the president. The president had just heard about Romney's policies that night and had no dirt on them, and nothing to say for himself, and no solid plan of his own. So there wasn't a lot of attacking going on, and not a lot of debating either given that the President wouldn't answer challenges directly.

&gt;Personally, I didn't find much substance in the debate. I'm not sore because ""my team lost,"" I was just wholly unimpressed with the whole thing. 

Yeah it is because your team lost, as you think that Obama's backing down had to do with just being too badass to win. That's probably also why we lost Vietnam, as we were just too cool to engage the VC.

Obama didn't go to that debate to lose, but he did, because the other candidate was just more prepared and stronger. You'll see a different Obama at the next debate I'm sure.",1

"Democrats will almost certainly still have enough Senators to fillibuster, so not much.  Basically, imagine the effectiveness of the Bush presidency after say 2004.

"Well Mr. ""or and dumb ass democrat"" I disagree with you. First of all, it is not but Mittens who says things like: ""Education should be for those who can pay for it"". Who wants to eliminate Obamacare and, my personal favorite, who wanted a filter for porn. This guy can not run a country. Now, in my humble opinion, I think presidents should be elected because they have a majority of vote, direct votes, from the population. Many videos and articles have proved that it is possible to win the presidency with less overall population votes, if the right states are targeted to make them vote for you. That for me is not how politics should work, is should not be a game. Most countries in the world have a single vote method, where all the votes are counted and added to a grand total. You would see candidate A with 10 million votes and candidate B with 5 million votes. If the diference in votes satisfies the law then candidate A is elected president. If the votes are too close, depending on each countries law, there might be a second vote. Also if there are more than two parties, like it happens in many countries, the top two candidates pass to a second round of votes. It is a simple majority that makes you win. ",2

"1) Education after high school costs money, but education in public schools does not. College and University tuition costs money, so some people work part time while taking on some student loans. The US Government issues student loans and grants for qualifying students, and if you do well you can earn back the money to pay it off. The Obama administration has pushed for legislation to make less interest off of student loans. Overall, our universities are still quite desirable, however, and many students from Europe and Asia do come here to study.

2) If you are in a car accident, almost no hospital could ever turn you away from seeking help. However, all medical procedures cost money, as in Europe, and with no private insurance, which is usually purchased by your employer, you will have to fall to State or charitable aid, which exists. For citizens over the age of about 65, Social Security and Medicare exist as a publically funded insurance option. The challenge is to extend this insurance coverage to people of all ages.

3) Laws vary from state to state. Some companies at some states have ""at will"" work laws which allow either employee or employer to terminate a work agreement at any time. Other unionized jobs have stricter regulations against termination.

Nothing is as simple as you made it out to be. I believe we have many areas that we need to improve in the US, but we wouldn't be where we are in the world today if we hadn't done some things right.",1

I'm impressed, rather, that Romney was able to balance their budget and create enough of a surplus to fund a health care system. It worked in a wealthy state. That should be applauded.

Yes, it is a shame that other states and the nation as a whole is so massively in debt that we cannot even afford to fund Medicare and Social Security, not to mention another entitlement like ObamaCare. So what do we do? The only thing we can. Fix the economy. Get people working who want jobs. More taxpayers = more tax revenue. Working people won't need a national health system, so if we ever implement one, it can serve only the truly needy. But we're not there yet. Let's fix the economy first, then see what we can afford.

"The budget deficit is made up of three parts.  
1) Entitlements, primarily medicare.  Obamacare will cut the cost of medicare without reducing benefits.  Romney and Ryan promise similar medicare cuts, but then they will use them to pay for tax cuts.  R&amp;R go further by introducing ""premium care"", which means that the government will only pay for a small part of your medicare costs.  This would cut the deficit, but they only go into effect 10 years from now, after the baby boomers are mostly passed away, so they won't have a big effect on the deficit.
2) Bush tax cuts.  Obama's promised to not renew them.  He caved in 2010, but he's grown some spine since then.  Romney and Ryan promise to renew these cuts and give the rich more cuts.  So, Obama will cut the deficit, Romney and Ryan won't.
3) Revenue loss due to the recession.  Both sides promise to increase hiring.  More jobs = more tax revenue.  Romney's record on job creation in Massachusetts is abysmal.  Obama's isn't great, but we are seeing some job growth.

So far, Romney's only plan to reduce the deficit is to cut spending, but he doesn't say what he'll cut. Given the record of the GOP recently, this probably means fewer teachers, fewer cops, no school grants, less investment in new energy and other technology, and cuts to social programs like Planned Parenthood.

In all fairness, this is exactly what being a politician is about. It's not about your own ideology, for one thing: it's about representing the views of your electorate in government.

"I don't know why but when I came in here the following text is what I read. 
""As a former Libertarian presidential contender, the 2008 Libertarian vice presidential nominee, the former chairman of the Libertarian National Campaign Committee, and the man called ""Mr. Libertarian"" by media across this country, you might be surprised to find I’m supporting Republican Mitt Romney for president. Yes, this Las Vegan has gone “all in” for Mitt. Why? Because Mitt Romney is the only sane choice for Libertarians.

It’s simple. Libertarians believe in less government; lower taxes; cutting rules, regulations and mandates to get government out of the way of small business; reining in out-of-control government agencies like the EPA; auditing the Fed; and balancing the budget. Sound familiar?

So do Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Certainly a little less than Libertarians, including me, would like. But, I’ll take incremental progress over no progress. Mitt Romney is a step in the right direction.

Barack Obama is a thousand miles in the wrong direction -- a direction that leads to the bankruptcy of our children and grandchildren and the destruction of the American Dream. A vote for anyone but Romney is a vote for Obama and his disastrous road that leads to the end of America (as we know it).

The Obama you’ve seen for the last four years is nothing like the radical man who will be unleashed for the next four. The first Obama term was just a small taste of things to come. Without having to answer to voters again, Obama will be his REAL radical self. Without restraint, Obama will ignore Congress, and govern by Executive Order. These radical Executive Orders from ""Obama unleashed"" will change America forever.

Don’t believe me? Are you aware Obama issued almost 1,000 executive orders in his first term? That’s more than all other presidents in history combined (and still counting). In a second term Obama will render Congress meaningless.

In 8 years Bush added $3 trillion in debt and created 20,000 new government rules and regulations.

Disgraceful.

In protest, I left the GOP in 2007. Then along came Obama. He has added $5 trillion in debt and 60,000 new rules and regulations…in only 3 ½ years.

Unimaginable.

In a second term, with no voters to answer to, Obama will be free to wreck the American economy just as he was taught by a slew of radical, Marxist, American hating mentors -- Barack Obama Sr., Frank Marshall, Saul Alinsky, Professors Cloward &amp; Piven, Bill Ayers, and Reverend Jeremiah Wright. These aren’t liberals. They are publicly avowed radicals and communists.

In Obama's second term I believe he will unleash economic Armageddon -- the total collapse of the U.S. economy and our financial system.

Today, the real unemployment is in the 15% range. By 2016, we will look back with envy at ""the good old days."" You think $5 trillion in new debt is bad? Wait until ObamaCare kicks in, adding trillions in new taxes and spending that will double the national debt.

Europe has been following Obama’s plan for decades -- big government, big unions, big spending, big taxes, big pensions, big entitlements, free health care, too many government employees, out-of-control pensions, and unlimited spending on green energy. The result? Economic disaster on a grand scale. Greece, Italy, and Spain are enduring a tragedy few can comprehend. France is next. Someday we will read about this in history books.

America, under Obama, is following the exact same path.

Hopefully I’ve got your attention.

This election is NOT about Libertarian versus non-Libertarian. This election is about capitalism versus Big Brother socialism. Mitt Romney is far from perfect, but at least he believes in capitalism. At least he won't denigrate and discourage business owners. Be thankful for little things.

I’m not just a Libertarian. First and foremost, I'm a capitalist evangelist. I'm proud to be a small businessman.

Economic issues are the whole ballgame at this point. We need to get our fiscal house in order first. Without an economy, without jobs, it’s impossible to deal with all our other problems. Mitt understands, as President Calvin Coolidge once said, “The business of America is business.” That’s why electing Mitt Romney is so important.

This election is our LAST STAND to save America. Mitt understands that Obama’s rhetoric, constant threats against business, union favoritism, IRS intimidation, 60,000 new rules and regulations, stimulus to nowhere, never-ending unemployment and food stamps, the added taxes and regulations of ObamaCare, and the attempt to ban oil drilling and regulate the coal industry out of existence, have collectively ground the U.S. economy to a halt. We will not survive four more years of Obama as CEO of this economy.

The U.S. economy is a large, diverse, failing company in desperate need of a turnaround. At this moment in history America needs a CEO with a track record of extraordinary success, job creation, and specifically- experience turning around failing companies. That person is Mitt Romney.

As Clint Eastwood said, ""We own this nation."" It's time to take it back. The future of America and our children depends on it. Their quality of life is hanging in the balance. Our back is to the wall. Obama’s defeat is that important to our economy, our freedoms, our children’s future, and ultimately, the very survival of our country.

It’s time for a coalition of Republicans, conservatives, Tea Party activists, Libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, small business owners, financial first responders (investors and business owners willing to risk our financial lives to create jobs), patriots, and common sense middle-class Americans to join together and support Mitt Romney now.

That is why I’m voting for Mitt Romney. That is why I urge all Libertarians, and Ron Paul supporters, to swallow hard, put our differences aside, and support Mitt Romney.
Vote as if your life…your business…your children’s future depends on it. Because it does.""


Anyone cares to explain what is going on? 
BTW. Libertarians are basically Republicans that want to smoke weed and get laid.

But that's not part of the correct narrative. Everyone knows it was exclusively Obama's fault.,20

"when i was in illinois i would frequently get robocalls about israel and iran and nuclear weapons.


they were worded in such a way that I tried to save them because of sheer awesome post-apocalyptic movie intro quality.


alas, years and years ago now, long gone. I have not had the pleasure of another such robocall.


""In 1998 president Clinton allowed the nuclear scientist Al Almahadi (or something) to relocate from Germany to Iran, since then he has been working hard on developing nuclear weapons for the Ayatollah's regime, he will succeed, and Obama (and some democrat running for state senate) are applauding his efforts all the way""  ""they want a nuclear Iran and they will use the opportunity to expand control over your life"" ""do you want them to control your life? do you want a nuclear Iran?

Everything that has happened in the last few years has only led me to the conclusion that the whole thing is just theatre and none of the real changes this country needs will ever be made because of a powerful corporate lobby pulling the strings of both Romney and Obama. So, no I have nothing to say about the debate.",1
I like to think Obama winning and the smackdown of several prominent Tea Party members in recent elections is America's way of saying that backwards ideologies like anti-gay marriage will no longer be tolerated,34
Obama,3
"I appreciate that you avoid hyperbole. That is refreshing to hear. However, you didn't answer my question. How is Obama passing laws that take away the ability of people making their own decisions any different than your desire to force your ideals upon others?

Personally the idea of a cultural authoritarian is terrifying to me. Culture is a very subjective thing. You say that we should live based on Gods word. But which God should we choose. And if you say The Christian God, as I assume you will, then what version of that word should we follow. Christianity has a basic belief system that works well for an individual who chooses to follow it freely, but even most Christians cannot agree with each other upon it's interpretation. 

So how can it be responsibly translated to a code of laws that can be enforced upon a populace as diverse as the United States without destroying the very core that this country was founded on.

To some extent it seems like you are saying that people are free to pursue happiness **only** if they pursue happiness in a manner in which you approve. That leads to people being judgmental, that leads to corruption and that leads to any number of terrible abuses of power that should not be allowed in a country that truly cherishes freedom.",2
Yes he's a democrat so he's allowed to do that but not the evil republicans. Obama got beat in the first debate so Biden had to step up and act like a bitch to look like he won. ,1
"According to the constitution is pretty clear who is and is not allowed to be president. Until that changes, then it stands on its own merits. Right now its just kinda something that most people here find funny. The birthers are right, hes is not able to be president, but for all the wrong reasons. Hopefully Hawaii will regain its sovereignty back and it will just be a footnote on Obama's Presidency. At the current time and place America is under the mass delusion that Hawaii is a part of the United States so under that delusion his presidency is valid. The problem is its a delusion. ",-8
that last part seem to have been ignored by the hivemind.  Obamabots you guys do what you do best! ,-7
One of the moments that made me want to throw something and that also illustrates your point was the rising cost of health insurance comment. Not a single reply on Romney's assertion that Obamacare is causing premiums to rise even though you could make a decent counter argument based on the fact that premiums always go up but the size of the increase has been trending down recently. Nothing.,1
"The reddit voting algorithm is logarithmic. In terms of the front page and the hot category, posts are ranked by total score as well as how quickly they attract upvotes. The first 10 points are worth exactly the same as the next 90, and then the next 900 after that. When a subreddit reaches a certain density of voters, anything that doesn't get *immediate* recognition is buried under many posts that do. The kinds of posts that result in a quick upvote are typically things like advice animals, where you can scan it from the thumbnail and get a cheap formulaic joke in less than four seconds. Not to mention the fact that those who upvote memes can upvote a hundred in the time it takes you to watch or read anything of substance. A complex article will be buried before the new queue voters even finish reading it. Anything controversial or disagreeable has no chance beneath opinions everyone already agrees with. Because of this, the only articles left are sensationalistic ones, upvoted quickly for the headline alone, whether or not they have any credibility or even more than a paragraph of text. /r/poltics will often upvote straight to the top articles that are heavily biased, unsubstantiated blogspam, barely better than rumors.  Essentially, more users there are, the more posts get filtered - and Reddit's filtering process produces abject garbage. The fact that any serious discussion or controversial debate goes on at all is a miracle.



Additionally, as a subreddit rises in membership and upvote totals, it attracts an increasing amount of attention from users scanning /r/all. Voters from /r/all naturally have little idea of the purpose of the subreddit, and its specific rules and culture. Assuming they even look at the subreddit the post comes from. When the subreddit ""I'mgoingtohellforthis"" attained notoriety and started attracting more upvotes than it even has subscribers, half the comments became variations of ""What the fuck is this lame ass shit?"" It went from hardcore 4chan-style racism to jokes about Justin Beiber being gay. The larger a subreddit becomes the more it loses it's 'point' and becomes just part of the generic reddit monoculture. The racist joke subreddit is probably a bad example, but try looking at Askscience. Anything with &gt;1000 upvotes makes it to /r/all and attracts users who don't know that any off-topic, unscientific discussion is banned. The subreddit has 45 moderaters and the bullshit is removed, but you can still see the grey wastelands of ""[deleted] [deleted] [deleted] under every popular question. Or for an even older example, the ""Does anybody else"" subreddit. The point was originally to find strange quirks that a few people might share, like going up the stairs on all fours or bringing a blanket everywhere. The more ""mainstream"" it got, the more people upvoted extremely common, obvious shit, that everyone agreed with. Anything really strange was filtered out by the downvotes, or lack of of upvotes, of the masses of new users. God, I still remember ""DAE Like soft cookies"". What a special snowflake you are, what with half the fucking cookie section at the grocery store advertising how soft, chewy, and moist their cookies are, and cookie commercials showing homemade, right-from-the-oven cookies being slowly pulled open, revealing their ooey-gooey centers. When a subreddit explodes in membership, the community that made it special is pushed out of the way. Maybe I sound like a hipster, but in this case it's justified - imagine if fans got to vote on which music a band made.



About a month ago, in another post, to illustrate what I meant about the voting algorithm, I sorted /r/gaming by 'top this week'. I had to go to #118 before I found an article. Before it there were 115 pictures and 2 youtube videos, average length 57 seconds. I'm not saying that the content of the large subreddits is too mainstream, or lowest-common-denominator. It's far, far, worse than that - it's instantly digestible content. 


Or, closer to what we're talking about here, compare the different atheism subreddits.


Top 15 in the hot queue

/r/atheism (1,402,324 readers) - 8 imgur links (memes, pictures and text), 3 social media posts, 2 articles, 1 personal story/joke, 1 gallery of images

/r/skeptic (57,651 readers) - 7 articles, 3 ""can someone debunk this claim""s, 1 blog post, 1 meta self-post, 1 snopes post, 1 social media post, 1 video. Subreddit limits memes and blogspam.


/r/freethought (30,329 readers) - 13 articles, 1 video, 1 self post discussion.


/r/trueatheism (24,548 readers) 8 self-post questions/discussions, 4 videos, 3 articles. Subreddit does not allow images.

/r/RepublicofAtheism (3,345 readers) 13 articles, 2 videos. Subreddit requires that posts be ""relevant"".



That's just the *type* of content. I didn't bother trying to compare the length or quality of the articles and other posts, but the difference is obvious from even the most cursory glance. The subreddit deterioration applies to Reddit as a whole, and though I sound like a pretentious asshole for saying it, the site did used to be slightly better. We didn't have Barack Obama coming in to do an AMA, but we had more lengthy posts, more technology and science, more articles where the top comments got to be discussions instead of ""This is sensationalist bullshit because...""


Of course, everyone says that. When they introduced comments one of the first comments ever submitted was something like ""Really? This website is going down the toilet"". I might hate the defaults and a hundred other subreddits, but I admit most of the small ones are still fine. And I can use RES to filter out specific annoyances, for example blocking the entire quickmeme website. Even keywords, like ""saw a redditor"" and ""does anyone else"". No matter how bad it gets, with the subreddit system, we can pretty much just split infinitely. Maybe it's just that the more I use Reddit, the more I see it's flaws, and the novelty of the content wears thin. I've seen this exact askreddit question posted [dozens of times.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/search?q=unpopular+opinion&amp;restrict_sr=on)",1
"When an otherwise nice person has had their mind poisoned by religious horseshit (and no, I'm not being /r/atheism, fuck those guys too). 

A guy I really liked to hang out with had this conversation with me:

""Well, god didn't make people perfect but they have to rein in their impulses. Like one guy might really be angry and want to kill someone, and another might want to, you know, be gay.""

""You just equated murder with homosexuality. The difference is, murder actually affects and hurts other people, how does his being gay affect you at all? How does it hurt anyone?""

""It does hurt people.""

""How?""

...thinks for a second... ""well, it really offends me to see it.""

Now it's awkward hanging out with the guy, and he's always been a really decent and fun person to be around. He even seems to have a brain, he does well in life... but the same parents that made him that way also condemned him to a lifetime of bigoted thinking and belief in fairy tales.

Rant 2: When people choose to argue politics from a position of ignorance, and they don't even have a sense of just how much they don't know. 

Before commenting on something like obamacare or military spending or the upcoming election, you have to know an absolute shit ton. For example, if you're seriously going to have an open mind about which president you'll vote for, you have to research their voting record, look for contradictions... for indications that they'll change their votes based on popular pressure or corporate donations. You have to know their background and experience, and somehow try to get a sense of their overall decency as a human being despite having never met them, and despite an army of publicists constantly exercising spin control.

You can have a million statistics on-hand for the economy but you almost need a PHD in economics to know how to interpret them.

You might think you 'get' health care, but without working in the industry... do you really get it?

If people refused to talk politics until they had all the necessary facts and qualifications, 99% of us would be forced to just duck the topic entirely (myself included). But my goal isn't to discourage discourse or shut up people who I disagree with. I just want people to understand their own ignorance and admit to it, not make simplistic arguments that are mostly just regurtitated TV sound bites.",1
"I support Romney, but I do not like him or his views. I just think that he would be better at making jobs. Obama is a good man, but he hasn't done anything to help the current state of the economy like he said he would.

"All the Russian botnets in the world isn't going to stop this.  The only thing that will stop this is getting involved politically.  Unfortunately, many on Reddit are very hyperpartison and WILL NOT take this fight to the head of the snake.

Democrats are in power and they need to be targetted.  Calling the offices of lowly Republican congressman will get NO WHERE.  You have to take this fight to Obama and Holder.

"Where do I start...

I love big bang theory, sorry, I find it funny.

I respect people being atheist, I married one, but get seriously pissed off when any idea of God is belittled and anyone who has any belief that isn't atheist is considered stupid/intolerant/anti logic/pro life/anti lgbt...I am the opposite of all those things and still believe, I don't want to convert anyone, you have no right to judge me.

I make mistakes. Mostly, I phone post and my phone does not let me edit easily and I give up. This doesn't mean I have nothing intellegent to add.

Thinking that women should be treated as human beings does not make me an uber feminist...I am a stay at home wife/soon to be mom...I believe that both men and women should treat each other with respect and equality and I call women out on this shit just as many times as I call out men.

Parents need to be parents. This means if your kid misbehaves, they should be punished (like take away a toy or put in time out, or for teens, take away their phones/game systems). Also, don't take your young kids to fancy resturants and midnight releases to PG 13 or R rated movies. Get a baby sitter or wait until it comes out on dvr...sorry being a parent means you don't get to do every last thing you want when you want to.

I will punch anyone who says yolo with any amount of seriousness (making fun of it is acceptale). I also hate swag...grow the fuck up people.

Funny stuff happens to random people, why would they record it if they didn't know it was going to happen? Use your brain.

I don't say/share things for upvotes. Karma is imaginary and means nothing. I often share difficult experiences to illistrate a point or to reach out to others who may be suffering to show they are not alone. I have received amazing support in my darkest hour and my goal is to help others if I can. No one deserves to suffer alone and it can be hard to put yourself out there, especially on a site that will call you a karma whore and claim it's fake. I will give what proof I can if asked, but there is a limit on what I will show out of respect for those involved.

I don't like Obama and do not want to vote for him. For the record I don't like Romney either and I have some tough choices to make. I am an independant, my veiws are very moderate, and I hate the bull shit from the extremes on both sides.

"No, not so far. Based on the way swing states are lined up right now and the current division of electoral votes Obama is going to win.

(the moderator did not hold down the fort) If anything i think morally and socially Obama is in the right and as such the public will see that and vote accordingly. Also i have not spoken to any young people recently who will vote for romney and the older republicans i know are not voting as they dont like either candidate. Keep in mind i live in a very conservative state as well. That isn't saying they dont exist, but the point is that if i am not feeling an overwhelming republican vibe yet, well...just not expecting mittens to win.",2

So no, I will not go in there telling them ObamaCare is the way to go, but I will go in there and ask them, ""How do we fix this for me""?

To use a dumb metaphor: The GOP would rather crash the bus than get in the back, and while Obama isn't the greatest bus driver, he's still getting us where we need to go. I think one of the reason's the rhetoric is so one sided here is because he is the only legitimate option.

But yeah, I wish he took a stronger stand for civil rights, or penalized the banks when he bailed them out, or didn't extend the Patriot Act. I personally wish he was farther to the left.

Remember the ""Anybody but Bush"" campaign of 2004?  The Democrats ended up with John Kerry, the guy who lied about what he saw in Vietnam, and married into Big Tomato, and was on either side of every major policy issue.  Not exactly the ideal candidate there either, but the sentiment was the same.  Whoever it is, just get Bush out of office.  It failed then, and a campaign from the other side based is the same ideology would fail too.  I didn't like it then, and I don't like the idea of getting somebody...anybody, just to replace Obama.

"Trump's accusations were sideshow tabloid distractions, and Obama treated them as such, using them to fuel a genuinely funny comedy routine.

"From the outside world looking in, Americas gun laws are primitave and just plain stupid. Defending the legality of owning a weapon thats only purpose is killing other human beings is just unforgivable. 

And in relation to what you said about kids thinking 'fuck it, its not worth it', that would eventually begin to happen but it would probably take some time.

In the UK and other Western nations troubled kids dont go looking for guns to shoot people. I believe this is in part due to the fact if you place a gun in 99% of the populations hands their reaciton would be ""woah, this thing is scary"" as we have not been brought up in a place where guns are considered normal. 

Unfortunately the American gun lobby is too strong and Obama therefore wouldnt have the bollocks to go against them as his popularity would ultimately be deemed more important than planting a signinficant seed for gun reform.",0

Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.

"In the Reagan era, the Republican party was incredibly attractive to many moderates and independents, due to their true fiscal conservatism and modern conformations to the social issues of the time. Now, however, the party has been hijacked by a Neo-Con influence that refuses to acknowledge a changing social climate, while disregarding their own platform concerning fiscal conservatism.

Who then, other than a die hard republican, would be swayed to an old and stale view and understanding on social issues, coupled with the blatant disregard for the one thing that actually attracts people to the party, that being a small government, fiscally conservative party? The answer is clearly, not enough to maintain a dwindling hold on the political landscape. 

It is up to each county and district to develop a grassroots effort to vote out their corrupt neocon leadership in the GOP in exchange for a more socially aware and fiscally conservative party leadership. The majority of people holding office in congress are puppets of the party platform, or whoever happens to be the highest bidder for their vote on social issues that have a lesser pull on their re-election.

Once party leadership is changed, the platform can be changed to something palatable by the United States general population, and indeed the rest of the world. At that point, the GOP can begin to develop a better slate of representatives they run for office.

The Party, within the next 2 years, will experience a split between the Neocons and the grassroots attempting to pull power from them. I believe that the Republicans that campaigned for Ron Paul within the GOP will be instrumental in leading this charge for a pro-liberty, fiscally conservative, and not entirely socially retarded message with a focus on reforming the Federal Reserve, monetary policy accountability, and less government infringement on personal freedoms.

Hopefully, this transformation will have happened within 4 years, and the GOP can field a candidate that does more than ""Obamacare is bad, Big bird, Binders"" and all sorts of other lies.

Otherwise, you can expect them to lose more and more seats through 2014, and, barring major economic collapse between now and 2016, another Democrat in office after President Obama's second term ends.",3

Mentally ill people aren't rational, but they're also not stupid.

The reason they do that is because that's where the gun-free zones are.

The government creates pockets of people who are legally prohibited from protecting themselves. Schools, for example. The government forces mostly female teachers and young students into dangerous environments where they are prohibited from possessing any means of protecting themselves.

So naturally, that's where the crazed killers go to find a good supply of unarmed victims.

So, do they vote for Obama because they don't agree with Romney?  You know Romney or Obama will win because they are the most popular and the other candidates don't have nearly the amount of backers to get enough electoral votes.

So the person decides Romney isn't a good choice for whatever reason.  They pick Obama because they agree with more on what he says or because they don't like Romney's plan(s) that much?  Yes, quite a lot of people do actually.

Not voting doesn't do anything for or against that person or any candidate and people don't vote for many reasons whether it be a disability, laziness, they don't care, etc.


Your edit question:  I don't know if I follow but here it goes.  Each state in the USA has a number of electoral votes which is based on how many people that state has in both the House of Representative and the Senate.  The more electors per state, the more important it is to win.  You need 270 electoral votes to become president.  That means, states like California that have 55, are a big deal so you'll see candidates do a lot of campaigning there.  Candidates are most likely to go to swing states though and not ones that are heavily liberal or conservative as its a waste of money and time.  Swing states are states that can go either way for each candidate.

Hope that answers your questions.",1

"The President has a huge amount of influence, but a lot of time it's just that - influence without direct ability to change something. While it's something to keep in mind while criticizing him, it's also not an excuse. A big part of that role is the ability to get the different groups to follow your lead or work together so that something can get done. 

With Obama, the Republicans controlling congress have been so insanely determined to block anything he does to try to take the presidency from him that there are a lot of things he gets slammed for which is solely because of Congress's political bickering. Still, there was a period before Republicans took Congress where the Democrats did nothing and the Whitehouse's support and endorsement of a number of issues damaging civil liberties can be blamed pretty squarely on him. 

I have a few Republican 'friends' on fb that I keep on my feed just to try to understand how they arrived at their belief. Sometimes they have good criticisms, sometimes they'll blame Obama for things that are absolutely not related or that were orchestrated by Republicans in Congress simply to spite him. Example, they recently forced a vote on official budget plans for the House even though they already had one. They had a bunch of Republicans propose a bunch of various extreme ones and required one from the President. His got 0 votes - 0 from Democrats because they knew the whole thing was a publicity stunt, and 0 from Republicans of course. Then they spread the word that the Presidents budget plan was so bad no one voted for it. Even though the whole thing was just a stunt orchestrated by them.

"&gt; Romney again promised to “not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans” and also to “lower taxes on middle-income families,” but didn’t say how he could possibly accomplish that without also increasing the deficit.


He said he would cut government and merge a lot of government bureaucracies and send things like Medicare to the state level effectively cutting spending. Don't forget he mentioned cutting PBS as a joke. Not only that but lowering rates and decreasing loopholes that small businesses can't get around effectively helping small businesses while keeping the tax income for the fed the same.

&gt; Romney claimed a new board established by the Affordable Care Act is “going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.” Not true. The board only recommends cost-saving measures for Medicare, and is legally forbidden to ration care or reduce benefits.

Not true, Romney stated that ultimately (keyword ultimately) that Obamacare will tell people what kind of treatments they can have. Telling people what treatments should be made does not necessarily mean rationing and shame on them for putting the words in his mouth. In Sec.3403 subsection (b) it states the purpose of the committee is ""in accordance with the following provisions of this section, reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending"" What's the point of a committee if it's doing what the free market does on its own, without a price tag. Instead of letting the free market do its thing and have them decide what's the most cost effective while achieving the best care you'll have something similar to the US Postal Service or the DMV where it's cost effectiveness instead of quality care and service.

&gt; Romney accused Obama of doubling the federal deficit. Not true. The annual deficit was already running at $1.2 trillion when Obama took office.

[False](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_deficit) (also the sources are on the right hand side, including from the fiscal year budgets from gpo.gov)

&gt; Romney claimed that middle-income Americans have “seen their income come down by $4,300.” That’s too high. Census figures show the decline in median household income during Obama’s first three years was $2,492, even after adjusting for inflation.

Probably the only legitimate exaggeratory falsehood in this entire article.

As for politifact, most of the facts were half-true, mostly-true and two were mostly-false. How on earth can you have something ""half-true"" or ""mostly true"" is beyond me. Is a true fact not a fact? If it's false it's a lie. 

&gt; Mitt Romney says up to 20 million will lose health insurance due to Obama health care law (according to the CBO report)

They rated this false? The CBO report did say up to 20 million. Of course the other middle estimates were lower however the report stated just that and he worded his statement correctly in saying ""up to"". There is nothing false about that.

P.S. if you are wondering if I just made some of these up on the spot I didn't. I have actually heard people use all of these arguments. A girl I work with even incredulously responded with ""You're voting for Obama?! But this is texas!"" As if somehow the state I live in was supposed to govern my presidential vote, and when I tried to explain not only that Texas hasn't always been so heavily republican biased and that its capital is one of the largest progressive/liberal minded culture hubs in the country she responded with ""You don't even get it.

His timing may be politically motivated, but there is no reason to think he does not support marriage equality. He is the first President to come out in favor of marriage equality.

"This probably won't get read but whatever. TL;DR at the bottom

Reddit is big, there are a lot of of diverse opinions on reddit but it's not just big in population but in size, the more obscure the redditor the deeper they hide within reddit. The stereotypical redditor is an athiest/agnostic, liberal, prosocialism, prodemocracy, antiwar, prolife (with an attitude towards BC for reducing abortion), antireligious fanaticism, proequality, proscience, prologic, proequality, antiracism protechnology, anticorporate, male between their 20s and 30s.


Like most humans redditors like to get their hate on, like likeminded views, and like to help others. Most redditors are not fervent in these various beliefs because they are not heavily affected by them. 

You will find that the people in /r/atheism come from highly religious areas where it's an impedance to their daily lives. People on /r/politics are worried about America's path, and are reliant on the success of their government. 

I'm from Canada, I don't really talk to religious people ever. So even though I think it's unlikely that there is a god, I don't really care, I don't bring it up a lot, I don't complain about it on /r/atheism. If I was surrounded by religious whackjobs who wouldn't let my friends get married and refused to let my girlfriend get an abortion, I might be a bit more concerned about atheism, I might go on the internet to vent my frustrations but I don't.

Canada has universal healthcare and a healthy dose of socialism, radical conservatism doesn't really affect me. I'm not a fan of my countries conservative party, but it's not like the Republicans of America.

I don't have to argue with creationists because in an urban Canadian city the idea is silly. If I actually hear someone claim that evolution is made up (I can't recall it ever happening) I would find it bizzare, surreal.

The point I'm getting to is this: Stephen Colbert's quote ""Reality has a well known liberal bias"" is incredibly true. You might say I'm just a liberal because these are my stances and I'm just as bias, but my belief system is based off of logical examination of evidence, I'm open to debate based on facts. The facts are:


-There is no evidence of any religion having any basis in reality, any supernatural creator would be completely unknown to us

-evolution is basic biology, it's like basic atomic theory to chemistry, it's incredibly verified.

-abortion is something to be avoided, but the positives outway the negatives, these fetuses never became a person, or formed a memory

-socialism works, socialist countries with high taxes have the highest happiness rates, low unemployment, high life expectancy and so on and so forth. Working together yields better results, greed is not good, and no one needs to be a billionaire.

-religion causes more problems than it's worth.

-corporations when poorly regulated cause havoc

All of the basic views of reddit are more or less correct. Some redditors don't hold them for good reason (they are just followers, like followers of anything else) some redditors vary on the specifics. But logical examination of facts will generally lead you to these views. In Canada most of these views are fairly well upheld, as in many European countries.


The fact is, an unbiased examination of Romney is that he is a bad candidate. Ignoring Obama entirely, Romney should not be elected president. His business experience is highly questionable, he has no consistent stances on anything, the idea of lowering taxes on the wealthy in America is laughably absurd. The current Republican party in America is obscenely corrupt. Propped upon the votes of fools, with the money of very rich men. In most modern countries both candidates would be too far right. America is too far right. A more socialist economy and social agenda would only aid your country. These are facts. These are explainable, definable things. You can find all this information out there.

Is reddit's response to Romney winning the debate slanted, yes. Is reddit's attempts to blame the ref or ignore it a poor logical stance. Yes. Is reddit strongly disliking Romney biased? No. Romney is a serious threat to the well being of a lot of people. 

Reddit is rational, come to any comment thread on any article and you will find the truth, or something close, and a counter point, and a link to a study. The rational truth is that Romney is bad. Reddit is fairly objective, perhaps a little fervent, occasionally they fall for the same trappings of other ideologies but ultimately the views of Reddit are an approximation of reality.

TL;DR Reddit is rational. Romney is objectively bad. American politics are irrational.",1

And I'm in the middle of all this, and I'm a socially libertarian, economically conservative/liberal. And occasionally I'd raise a good point that'd just shut them both up, like ""Both of you are just applying logical fallacies to this, why not look at the issue, like *why* Obama's policies are good or bad?"" and then interject my viewpoint.

"The major benefits of marriage come from the Federal law, although individual states grant marriage licenses.

The law on the books when Obama took office was the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Among other things, it forbids Federal recognition of gay marriage. Therefore, you can get a gay marriage in Massachusetts, but the privileges of marriage are mostly denied to you.

Obama is the executive branch. He can't write laws, only sign them. A congress controlled by Republicans will never repeal DOMA. The best he can do is refuse to defend DOMA as constitutional, which he has done. The second best thing he can do is appoint sane Supreme Court Justices. DOMA is up for review by the Supreme Court.",1

"This is because of several factors and I'm going to just say them without trying to weave them into a narrative, but they all play into why I think the US lacks a good healthcare system.


* Debter's prisons. This may be the oldest thing on the list, but when books like Oliver Twist came out, some countries had prisons for people who had debts they could not pay. The vast majority of these prisoners were there for medical reasons, and the prisons were wretched places where entire families would be locked away and essentially left to slave labor to pay off debt they'd likely never be able to. I know at least in the UK the public outcry to ban such places resulted in part in their want for free healthcare. In the US at that time extreme debt was something you could either move away from to avoid or claim bankruptcy and get absolved some. Most US bankruptcy is still medically related today.

* The ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" attitude many Americans have means they'd prefer to do anything possible to avoid looking like they didn't get where they are by anything other than their own blood sweat and tears. This is conflated with the idea that you didn't ""earn"" something if it was paid for by taxes because you didn't pay the full cost of it. It's an admirable ideal twisted to keep people from asking to not be left in crippling debt when their bootstraps need some stitches in the hospital.

* There's also the ""I got mine, why would I care about you"" mindset wherein people who are covered by either an insurance company from work or medicare or medicaid (our two healthcare systems for the retired and *extremely* poor) don't feel any need to change the system as it is now. This is the group of people who are surprised that even after their insurance covers whatever it wanted to that they're still left holding the bag for far more than they can possibly pay themselves, but they get left in a ""devil you know is better than the devil you don't"" situation. They just assume the insurance will cover all but their copay when the system is thoroughly rigged on both the insurance and provider side to leave the patient with large amounts of the bill.

* There's also the fact that many people don't need terribly much medical care most of their lives and it's just not a daily concern to try and reduce the cost of having a burst appendix or having a broken bone set until you have it happen for most people.

* It's politically advantageous for republicans to talk fire and brimstone when someone brings up universal healthcare, it gets them votes from (mostly) the very people who'd be most benefited by a single payer national healthcare system. Democrats generally don't get fired up enough in support of it and don't do a good enough job humanizing the horrible tales and problems lack of a better system leaves people with.

* AND THE BIG ONE! As with many things in life, when you just can't figure out *why* something is the way it is even though it seems to make no sense, the answer is often ""money"". In the US we generally have healthcare providers (hospitals, private doctors, etc...) and insurance companies that pay them along with heavy subsidies from the federal and state governments. Since large amounts of the population have no say or even much insight into how much medical care costs it's in the interests of insurance providers to haggle the costs they pay down and the providers to inflate the costs up. They'll put bandages that cost pennies on a bill for 30 bucks because they know the insurer will get a discounted rate of 10bucks. This has been going on for decades now which is why the costs have gotten so out of hand, and think about how much really expensive procedures cost. Hell, it's an average of $10,000US to have a child in a hospital now and that's for plain-jane non-epidural non-c-section no complications births. If you get cancer and try to treat it you're just about certain to go completely broke. Same with chronic diseases usually as well. There is no political will to outlaw gouging of prices in this way, and former employees of insurance companies largely run the governing bodies that would have any say in it anyway.

* There are also other things that play into it like doctors needing huge insurance policies for when people try to sue them for malpractice, weird laws and de-facto systems that encourage the prescription of drastically more expensive name brand medicines when there are generics for small fractions of the cost, and other things, but those points should give you the basic rundown for why the US has such a hard time breaking from our current bullshit to something more humane.

I think if the current ""obamacare"" thing gets fully implemented it'll at least get everyone covered by some sort of insurance and bring everyone in the US to the point we're all chaffed and hurt by it's failings and then hopefully there might be stronger political will to correct and renovate the system into something better.",2

"Yes. Vote for liberal Democrats.

Think I'm kidding? I know liberals have a reputation for deficit spending, but it's completely wrong, given the history of the past 3 decades. We had the fastest growth of government spending under Reagan and Bush II. Clinton left us with a surplus (after raising taxes, a fiscally conservative move). Bush II immediately spent the surplus on taxes for the rich; a move that liberals opposed because they wanted to pay down the debt. (BTW, back in 2001 Paul Ryan argued for he tax cut because he was worried the government would pay down our debt *too fast*.) When Howard Dean was governor of Vermont, he build up a rainy-day fund when the economy was good, and tax revenues were high, to use during a down time. He didn't cut taxes or increase spending to use up the extra money.

Obamacare is a money-saving move. CBO scored Republican bills to repeal Obamacare as increasing the deficit.

That's the tip of the iceberg. Republicans were fiscally conservative in the postwar, Eisenhower era. They went off the deep end 3 decades ago, and are just getting crazier. Want social liberalism and fiscal conservatism? Vote Dem. That's where the center used to be.",2

"The gypsy culture in the UK is predominantly inclusive, and whenever gypsies are featured in the news, it is in association with criminal activities.

When you compare this with the US, black people do have a disproportionate prison population and higher crime statistics, and it could be argued that black culture is inclusive, it is to nowhere near the same degree.

Will Smith is black, but he isn't associated with crime or violence. Same with some of my friends, or the black guy who smiled at me today.

While the term ""black"" is obviously a description of someone's race based on the appearance of their skin, the term ""gypsie"" is an exonym applied to the Roma people, with the direct associations of caravans, inclusive living, and, unfortunately crime.

However, a black person who is not part of the ghetto can still be described as 'black', a gypsy who doesn't live in a caravan and abides by the law is unlikely to be described as such.

Now, I have no idea where you get this 'Europeans call Americans racist all the time' shtick. I'm from the UK, have travelled extensively in the US and Canada, and have plenty of American friends (including my girlfriend) and I haven't heard of Americans complaining of this before, nor have I heard my European compatriots describing Americans as racist.

Also, Europe is filled with racism. In some European countries it's still acceptable to black up, the Prime Minister of Italy described Obama as ""tanned"", we have neo-Nazis up the wazoo and casual racism still exists in many progressive societies.

Conversely, I would argue that the US has such a fear of racism (or merely the label of racism) in progressive societies that there tends to be hyper-correction and avoidance of anything that couple potentially be construed as racism. For example, the term 'African-American', arguably far less accurate than 'black', affirmative action, allowances of 'black only' scholarships, etc.

So in answer to your question, when people in the UK use the term 'gypsy', it is generally to mean the class of people who are the root cause of crime in many parts of the UK, rather than the race of people to which it applies, where 'Romani' or 'Roma' is preferred.",7
I think obama explains things more clearly but as a result what he wants to say runs over time more often. I always felt like romney was from zero punctuation and maybe if he talked fast enough no one would bother to look up the facts he was citing. ,6
"1) Just because you like a person or he/she is a good person, doesn't mean that he/she would be a good president. No one is perfect anyways, so keep in mind, although you like someone, it doesn't mean they will make the right choice for you.

2) Supporting someone doesn't mean you like someone. In a two party system, it's often because you **don't** like the other person. Example: many people didn't vote for Obama, they voted for not-Bush/McCain/Republican. I would guess there are going to be people disappointed in Obama who are going to vote not-Obama for breaking promises or not fulfilling them.

3) Most voters choose one (or a couple) issue(s) to be most important: eg ""jobs"", ""education"", ""gay marriage"", ""abortion"". The political party system is set up to be opposites; so if your issue is ""abortion"", (if you are pro-choice) you vote Obama or (if you are pro-life) you vote Romney. Therefore, what people would like or dislike about Obama are his policies. Economic policies, Social policies, Domestic politics, International Politics, Corruption, Torture, Taxes, etc.

3) Granted you can also get into the worst reason, ""ooooh he's handsome"" or he looks like a president.  #I'm looking at you random woman of my childhood who voted for Clinton for this reason

4) Also, the better question is why is Reddit so obsessed with Obama? Yes, he ""did"" an AMA.

"When your candidates were campaigning last time, I was still in high school. I'm from Romania, an Eastern European country, a member of NATO and the EU.

I remember that while the campaign was still on, some fat american chick came to our school with some program. One day, the school English teachers brought all the kids to a lecture hall and the american chick asked us what we thought of the US campaign and the candidates. 

Modesty and all, I was in the top 3 English speakers in that high school. I often went to English language contests and came back with prizes, etc. Back then, as I still do now, I wasted countless hours on the Internet and was pretty well aware of the Obama vs McCain pro and con arguments.

However, I kept quiet and listened to what my colleagues had to say. It was pretty unreal. The discussion went from statements to full-fledged debate and taking sides. In about 30 minutes, people were shouting their opinions. The american chick (still can't remember what she represented or why she was in our school) was grinning and moderating the bicker. The teachers were seated behind her and were looking at the kids arguing.

Everyone was pretty much clueless and all the time through that heated discussion, I was thinking of what the reason for this could be.

Towards the end I spoke up and asked what the fuck this was for? What good was it? Of course, my bad language wasn't appreciated and the only answer I got, that everybody there got from the teachers/american chick was that ""we'll see in the future"".

What the flying shit was that supposed to mean? 

Well, in the following years, the wonderful American Army built active bases in my country (because we are at the border of NATO territories and closest to the Middle East), they built ""rocket shields"" that supposedly prevent attacks and many press scandals have erupted that talked about ""secret military torture prisons"" in our country. 

No matter the reason, I say that we're pretty deep in now to care, as a citizen, who the fuck runs the USA. Since any idiot with fairy tale beliefs can run a nuclear superpower (I'm looking at ""God told me"" W. Bush and Planeteer Romney), I'm worried. We're basically sharing borders with Mother Russia and, historically, it wouldn't be the first time we've been raped by them in the event of war.

"Episcopalian, though admittedly I rarely go these days except for Christmas and Easter with my mom.

The deacon who taught my 7th grade Confirmation class was gay, the GLSENYouth group I went to as a teen was held in a church by the pastor and his husband, Gay Prom was held by the local Unitarian church, and three of the six chaplains at my college were gay (one Episcopal priest, one Reform Rabbi, and one renegade Catholic).

A lot of Episcopal church leaders have been calling for marriage equality for a long time, including [**Bishop Mark Sisk**](http://www.dioceseny.org/news_items/225-bishops-commend-obama-s-support-for-marriage-equality) and the church leadership of my home state New York. 

After the NY marriage victory, there was a note of controvercy when Bishop Provenzano of Long Island [**ordered gay priests to legally marry their partners**](http://www.christianpost.com/news/ny-episcopal-bishop-orders-gay-clergy-to-get-married-52529/) if they live in church housing together. This is the general rule for priests living with partners in church housing, but some clergy think it's inappropriate for the church to require legal contracts at all.

I'm also very proud that the Episcopal church is home to [**Bishop Gene Robinson**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Robinson) of New Hampshire, who gave Obama's inaugural prayer. Bishop Robinson has been with his husband Mark Andrew since 1987. Their relationship was first blessed by Bishop Theuner in 1988, Gene was elected Bishop in 2003, and in 2008 they got a legal civil union and had a formal wedding at St Paul's Church. The sermon he gave at NYC [**Gay Pride Day**](http://vimeo.com/35272053) a couple years ago is one of the most moving I've ever heard.

The Episcopal church has also become a strong advocate in the fight for the rights of trans* and gender variant people too. Last April, an interfaith coalition of clergy including [**Bishop Shaw**](http://blog.transepiscopal.com/2011/04/trans-faith-action-week-launches.html) appealed to the Massachusetts state legislature to save a trans anti-discrimination bill.

Meanwhile McCain was talking about having troops in Iraq for a century, and singing bomb-bomb-bomb Iran. Way I saw it, we had plateful of steaming shit in 2008. Obama's plan was to finally start doing the dishes. McCain wanted to leave the plate to fester, and instead go to the store, but a bunch of bread on a credit card, and start making some shit sandwiches to go with the shit plate.",1

"I don't think you guys are quite right here, it's not that two parties decided to block out all other ideologies in the interest of staying in power (while constantly fighting each other for more of that power).  

It's basically simple math, there are pretty much two sides to any given issue, and two parties have arisen to take opposite sides on each issue.  If you throw in two more parties, let's say green and libertarian - it doesn't DO anything or CHANGE anything.  YOU personally might feel your beliefs are more adequately represented, but you still lose in the end because most people don't agree with you, and that's how our democracy works.

I furthermore think calling politicians crooked is sort of the videogame version of how things are. Yes SOME of them are crooked, yes MOST of them are way more schmoozy than all of us. But the vast majority of them want to do good things and believe in what they are doing. I know you think, say, Obama is kowtowing to a certain industry just to get more money from them and get re-elected, but it's so much more complex than that.  Even if (in your view) he has made the wrong decision on that issue, it's one of a million decisions he's making and perhaps the most persuasive argument he heard was from someone that had a lot of thought (and their own financial interest) in the game. I guarantee you there is not a fireman alive that would do a better job as president of the united states than either Obama or Romney. By a long shot. A lot of the job is BEING a politician. A good heart and a strong back, even a genius IQ doesn't make you a good president. And someone believing something different than what you believe is not EVIL, and you don't have to choose the lesser of two evils. Seriously.  Choose the guy you think is going to be better at the job, despite your few (or numerous) differences. 

Anyway. In conclusion. More than two parties won't really fix a damn thing, even if funding is completely leveled. It's not that two parties are holding all other parties down, it's that the vast majority of people have little to no interest in any other party.

"I'm not trying to troll, I'm genuinely curious: Why does Osama bin Laden's death come up in so many posts here? What impact did it actually have beyond securing support for Obama?

In answer to the OP, I'd say...

* 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq by the US
* The Arab Spring
* The Fukushima disaster
* The impending economic collapse (or how we cut it close)",20
"This is a complicated question and that's why it is hard to get a straight answer.  The cleanest way to say this is, ""yes, but ... ""

During the Bush years, [a few things happened.](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20095704-503544.html)  There were tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, a prescription drug benefit was added, and we had two major wars.  None of these items were budgeted for under Bush -- meaning they did not appear on the balance sheet on the budget.  By simply accounting for these items, that alone increased the debt, **even though Obama did not make the decision to spend those funds.**  

There was a stimulus too -- funds that Obama *did* spend -- but that only comes to about $1.44 trillion.  

Now, the total number spent for all of these items is less than $16 trillion. So let's look at [how that can happen](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-57506201/national-debt-passes-$16-trillion-should-you-worry/):

&gt;But how could it be that Obama's policies only contributed $1.44 trillion to the debt when it has risen around $5 trillion since he took office? The answer is the recession. During a recession tax revenue falls as income falls, and spending on existing social services such as unemployment compensation and food stamps increases. The result is a larger deficit. However, Obama didn't cause the recession -- it was already well underway when he took office -- and **he cannot be blamed for the debt we've accumulated as a result of the downturn**.

From that same article (which explains the overall picture very well):

&gt;The increase in debt, which was largely the result of the stimulus package, didn't turn things around and propel us into recovery. Our problems were far too large for that. But it did stop things from becoming even worse.

You are misinformed.

The Roman Catholic church is a MINORITY.

Composed of primarily Hispanics, and a few remaining Irish and Italians.

Protestantism is by far, the dominate religion.

&gt;So if the Holocaust shows god's disdain for Jews than these other bits of persecution must show his disdain for Christians. 

There is nothing that compares to the Holocaust.

50% of the Jews on the face of the earth were rounded up and killed at that time.

There is nothing compatible to that in Christianity.

Because the Christians are not cursed by God.

&gt;So there are multiple 'correct' religions?

Yes.

The religion of Islam was dictated to Mohamed by the Angel Gabriel himself.

And Gabriel does nothing, without God telling him to do it.

But as I said, it is meant primarily for the Arabs.

If you are not an Arab, you should be a Christian.

Well, [here you go](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/full/index.html).  Who told you nobody knows?  If you don't want to read the bill, (hell, **I** haven't) then don't read it, but forming an opinion based on ignorance won't do you any good.  

I've read the layman's terms of the bill and have a basic idea of its pros and cons, and you should do so as well.  I'm pretty sure the Supreme Court read a bit of the law when they upheld its constitutionality.

&gt;Additionally, every medical or insurance professional I have talked to has said that they don't know exactly what this bill will do, but it looks like it will make prices go up.

What part of the bill is the part that makes insurance premiums go up?  Are they talking about the part where they will actually be forced to pay for people that are sick?  This is the part of the bill I agree most strongly with.  Insurance companies *need* to be regulated, at least to the point where they don't drop people for ""being too expensive""  When I worry about the potential benefit/loss ratio to me (a healthy young worker **with** insurance)  I look at [this graphic](http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/story/2012-06-28/health-care-ruling-whats-next/55900370/1).  

Now, the additional costs incurred by insurance companies having to cover people with no lifetime limits and pre-existing conditions is **supposed** to be covered by the [individual mandate](http://healthreform.kff.org/the-basics/Requirement-to-buy-coverage-flowchart.aspx)  (you can see by that chart whether you will be required by law to purchase insurance).  [This article](http://moneyland.time.com/2009/09/16/health-insurance-premiums-up-131-in-last-ten-years/) from 2009 (before ""Obamacare"" passed) illustrates how insurance rates have increased 131% in the last decade while becoming less generous in payouts for claims.  I'd like to see some more accountability on insurance companies, wouldn't you?  

&gt;Generally any time you can privatize something, it will be done more efficiently. 

I've seen this argument lots of times.  I looked around for some good links, but they are *REALLY* dry.  Basically they boil down to saying ""There are good arguments for and against privatization, and that it should be done with caution.  

&gt;Yes, you might have to regulate to an extent to keep companies from gouging consumers, which I'm not against. However, letting the government participate in an industry nearly always results in tons and tons of waste.

This part here is why I would like you to read some of the links I've posted, if not the law in total.  The fact you're arguing for privatization vs. government health care.  Uh, the American health care system **is** private, and I'm not seeing a whole lot of efficiency.  The thing to take home here is that Obamacare is *not* socialized medicine, (outside of the expansion of medicare) 

It is a [list](http://www.freep.com/article/20120628/FEATURES08/306250001/Affordable-Care-Act) of regulations taking insurance companies to task.

&gt;the federal government is stepping in and mandating who we can choose and what we can do as far as our healthcare.

No, it is not.  You as a citizen or small business, get to choose whatever insurance you want.  Matter of fact there's even a website set up to help you look through insurance options, [healthcare.gov](http://www.healthcare.gov/).  Of course you can still browse any website you want, you don't have to use theirs.

&gt;This sort of boils down to campaign finance, and how representatives are put into place, because they aren't put there to uphold the will of the people. They're put there to uphold the will of corporate donors. These corporate donors don't give a fuck about the people (seriously, study American business law and corporations, it's pretty well established that a corporation that promotes anything other than its own share price, and thus its own shareholders, is potentially wasting money)

Amen, brother.  You're talkin' my language now.  With American politics the way they are, I'm surprised the Affordable Care Act got passed at all.  I fear for the future of the act, but I guarantee that insurance companies will not be vying for the whole law repealed.  They'll want those consumer protections taken away and the individual mandate upheld.  I took a look a look around for [top political donors in 2009](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=2009&amp;indexType=s) (the year before it was signed into law) and there are a couple of pertinent players there.  The AMA, AARP, Pfizer, Blue Cross, all could stand to gain from everyone having coverage.  

I can tell you that the hospital I work at is **THRILLED** that Obamacare was upheld.  It will help us by hopefully reducing the amount of people that come in and are not covered, one of the highest expenses for a Trauma 1 hospital like mine.  

**TL;DR**  A healthy dose of skepticism is warranted, but take a look at the facts, and for god's sake ignore the punditry.  Also, her breasts are real, and they're *fantastic*

"B) Separation of church and state; gays should be able to have rights because they are people. The ""biblical principles"" this country was founded on has nothing to do with government, or it shouldn't. This country has no official religion for a good reason. It interferes with people's rights.

E) This year's Republican campaign is much more radical as a whole than Obama's administration. If you value your rights as a ""Christian"" and your states' rights, then why are gay and women's rights not as important? Because they don't affect you? Based on what I've read of the bible it seems that Jesus would be very sad that you seem to disassociate yourself from the issues of a country you live in just because they don't involve you specifically. 

F) If a government has no tie with religion other than not to interfere in it, then why should Obama's religious beliefs matter at all? Also Romney ""stands for"" way different things depending on who he's standing in front of. As a Christian shouldn't it be more important to be concerned with the good of your country and the fellow man that your god says you should love and less concerned with what you call yourself or what other people call you?

This is because ACA (Obamacare) does not address the provider side and costs of medical care, but rather the access and availability of insurance (the provider side). For employers relying on hourly cheap labor with razor thin margins (where quantity is the only way to make money), a bump in costs is expected to make the company adapt.

Papa John's is just being open about what they're doing and the effects of ACA. Everything in business is about alignment of incentives.

"I have done a few years of competitive debate, so i have a little bit of experience on the subject. Did obama win point by point. that is, did obama arguments respond to and/or refute mitt's. Maybe, but it might have just appeared that way because mitt was being so aggressive. 

But is that really ""winning"" a presidential debate. I don't think so, i think winning is who comes out ahead politically. Now, it is hard to predict the future, but wary of saying that obama fucked up politically. He made no major gaffs, and he was calm and relaxed, keeping with his persona. Mitt, was aggressive, to the point that, even though Obama spoke 4 minutes longer, it seemed like mitt was the one hogging time. That also goes with his persona of being a pompous prick.

furthermore, i am always wary of saying that obama made a major fuck up. Politically, the man is unbeatable. He lost one race when he first went into politics, and hasn't lost one since. Every major political endeavor he takes on(such as health care), he gets through. And it always seems like he's being a push over, or not strong enough, but i think he just knows exactly what he needs to do. 

During the debate he wasn't flustered, he didn't lose his temper, he was calm and relaxed as he took notes. He acted that way on purpose. He was already in the lead, he didn't need to make a big show and tear romney apart, that would have made him look like a dick.

"Not that they became significantly better at finding OBL; but, significantly more directed towards finding him. We look to our leaders for direction, not the actual physical action. Obama made OBL a higher priority in intelligence and military. Bush was more concerned with Iraq and other things. 

Other arguments aside, it came down to the leader prioritizing his resources towards different objectives. Obama said he would make OBL a priority and he did. He allocated the resources he had to finding, capturing, and killing OBL, and it got done. Considering Bush's own words on the priority level of OBL within his administration, it has become fairly evident that Bush didn't feel OBL was on the same priority level that Obama did. He may have instructed missions to gain critical information, but not to the extent that Obama did. I find that Obama's priorities aligned with my own in this regard and I commend the president for the job well done.  

Now, this is not to state that I feel that the servicemen and women and our intelligence don't deserve credit. They do. They deserve a lot of credit. I simply don't feel that if Bush were still president, or McCain were in office, that the level of commitment and resource expenditure to finding OBL would've been the same. We would've found the guy *eventually*, sure. And there wouldn't be a president in the world that would've said ""No, don't pull the trigger."" I simply believe that the actions and resource expenditure that Obama was willing to activate is what ultimately led to him being in the position to say ""Operation is authorized.

"Mass killings of Jews using SS troops and gas wagons started being used almost immediately when Soviet cities were captured.  Babi Yar occurred in September 1941, well before the war had turned.  The question was not what to do with the Jews, the question was how to do it to so many of them. It was going too slowly.

The whole Madagascar things was like a position paper written up by an intern to answer an Obama vs. Hitler debate question 'you're very anti-semitic. What is your plan for the Jews if you win the election?' On the public stage you can't answer 'kill them all, even the children and pregnant women.'  So they pull out this binder with an unfeasible plan of transport of millions of people on battleships they don't control to an island that isn't theirs.  Then when someone after the war starts asks 'what are they doing to the Jews?' a Goebbels operative pulls out the position paper for 'resettlement'.",0

"Opinions of a fifteen year old white kid:

I don't like Romney at all and I have various reasons backing that up, but who actually wants this guy in office? One of my friends was talking about his family voting for Romney because ""Obama is black."" That really ticked me off. If you vote for a certain candidate because of your religious beliefs, or you specify to voting for one party, you are part of the problem. You have to do research about each candidate and choose the one that suits your opinions the best. The RNC has not changed my opinion of him at all, actually, the more I see of him, the more I see his potential at being the next president, I get more and more physical pain from looking at his face. That's an understatement.

I don't like Obama as a president, but I think he's a cool guy and he's impressed me for his past three years in office. He's been the first president to make changes, whether in my life or even if it doesn't effect me at all and I appreciate that, but I would not vote for him, if I had to choose him over Romney, I would in a heartbeat.

I really like what Gary Johnson stands for, but the chances of him winning is very slim, and this is why i've given up hope for presidential elections, even know I will be persuading my mother to vote for him. 

I also think Ron Paul was one of the most intelligent candidates for president this year, the fact that he didn't participate in the mudslinging makes me think of him as a man who is stronger than the others, who are literally spending money on television commercials to attack their opponents with false opinions and facts. I will be doing more research before the presidential election, but I really hope something changes substantially. We need to pull our troops out of other countries, stop wasting money, and put the hardworking tax payer's dollars toward something beneficial and stop letting the filthy rich get richer. Of course, these are just my opinions based on my current knowledge, which is very low in comparison to the majority of people on this thread. So, please, instead of hating, I would like as much feedback as possible.",2
"I have a hard time believing that *either* candidate won the debate, which is probably why you see a lot of Obama supporters blaming the moderator, though imo I don't believe the failure for either candidate to win was specifically the moderator's fault.  

Anyone who says anything different must have been watching a different debate than I saw, frankly.  All I saw was the equivalent of elementary school smack talking in the playground.  Neither candidate answered the questions, they used each question as a springboard into the same one of three rhetoric talking points.  They treated the American public like no one could possibly understand what the answers to the questions should be, so they dumbed everything down to a point that I truly (for the first time) felt insulted by BOTH candidates.

So, I really don't care who the paper or who some website says won the debate, I think they both lost and the American people lost because we have these two idiots to choose from to lead our country for the next 4 years.  I think anyone posting links saying either person won the debate are really just parroting nonsense from someone else's mouth, I've yet to actually talk with a real person (read: not some silly internet blogger on some stupid political hype blog) who thought that either of the two actually did even a semi-passable job of answering the questions they were being asked.

"&gt;He spent thirty minutes and said nothing of substance

The President of the fucking United States came on to Reddit to answer a few questions. How much free time do you think he has?

&gt;I fail to see why it's a big deal that a guy spends next to no time coming to a site that is filled with his supporters and repeats talking points that he knows they want to hear.

Do you actually need me to explain why this is a big deal? Regardless of how the AMA was conducted, IT IS A BIG FUCKING DEAL. In fact, you probably couldn't get much more of a big deal, unless it was the spawn of Louis C.K and Neil deGrasse Tyson.

&gt;He answered a total of ten questions

What were you actually expecting? Hundreds of quirky, witty responses divulging all sorts of inside info and rampant Government conspiracies? Granted, it wasn't the most thorough AMA ever, but you were foolish to expect much more.

&gt;It was a lame publicity stunt that admittedly worked

*Obviously* it was a publicity stunt, every single high profile AMA is, I thought we had established this point by now? It's called give-and-take. The celebrity gets to push an agenda, we get to pitch a few questions. Not too hard to grasp, is it?

&gt;but that says less about what he did and more about what sheep the majority people are

People are sheep for displaying a bit of excitement about a MAJOR stepping stone for online communities? Jesus Christ, are you like the biggest fucking cynic in the world? It wouldn't have mattered if Obama logged in and called us all a big bunch of cunts, it is still a momentous occasion.

I tell you what fucks me off about Reddit; people see things in black in white. You are either with, or against. Not everything is that fucking simple. For example, I don't believe the Obama AMA was absolutely fantastic by any means, nor did it shed any new light on his current campaign, but I do see the influence this could have for all online communities, and we are the children of the internet, are we not? However, you have outlined how you find absolutely *nothing* positive about the event, going as far to say celebrating it is 'one of the stupidest fucking things you have seen'. That's what I hate about Reddit.

Good day.

"Now for the actual advice, if anyone is still bothering to read! lol

Fill out the FAFSA as soon as possible

 * Some scholarship awards are first come first serve 

You want to get money in this order

 * Pell Grants (Get the max you can every semester)

 * Scholarships
 * Subsidized Loans from federal govt
 * Part time work (It's low on the list because it directly affects your grades)
 * Family/Friends (In a pinch you can beg, and you might have to.)
 * A note about borrowing from family and friends, IT IS THE SAME AS ANY LOAN.  In a bank loan your collateral is your credit.  In a family/friend loan your collateral is your relationship, i.e. it WILL NOT survive if the loan is delinquent.
 * Food Stamps
 * Remember early on in this I mentioned Pride?  Your income will be well below the poverty line, I qualified for $100 a month in supplemental nutrition assistance, and I ate every dollar of that.

Avoid at all costs

 * Credit Cards
 * A loan will max out at 6.8%, thats a lot but somewhat reasonable
 * Credit cards average like 24% interest thats 2% PER MONTH  That shit will drain your finances forever and kill your quality of life and your credit.
 * Student loans not through the school
 * I think Obama has changed the laws on these but these were basically scams to fuck over college students at super high interest and can never be cleared through bankruptcy.

School Tips

 * Always go to class
 * Showing up is 60%... I repeat
 * Showing up is 60%
 * Meaning if you go to every class you are almost certain to at least get a C
 * Abuse office hours - This is how you get the A. Period.
 * TAs and Professors know a lot.  Their job is to share that.  They have all the answers, and they know what they are doing.  Stay in their office until you figure it out.  If you don't get it after going to every class and going to office hours often, the teacher knows you and will pass you any way because they have a relationship with you. Remember, people care if they know you care.
 * Get old tests, old notes, old homeworks from your classmates
 * Material doesn't change that much from semester to semester, if it's not the exact same test it will still teach you a shitload about the same material.  If it is the same test, congrats on your shiny new A.
 * Make friends
 * I was the old dude everywhere I went.  What did I have in common with a bunch of 19 year olds?  Everything.  I wanted to get good grades, I wanted to learn this stuff, I was stressed as hell, I was broke, and I drank in my precious little free time.  Everyone learns the material from a different angle, and you can learn from everyone.

Personal Life

 * Suck it up
 * You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake
 * You are an old, broke community college student with nothing to offer
 * But FUCK IT you are working your ass off, and every hour is moving you in the right direction.
 * You don't deserve to be confident about your life success, but build your new confidence on your hard work, and your progress.  You have a goal and you are working to get it, and that is the most rewarding thing you can do.
 * GYM GYM GYM GYM GYM GYM
 * All universities and many community colleges have AWESOME gyms for students.  Get in there, play basketball, join the boxing club, do yoga, do fucking zumba, pilates and cross-fit.  There is nothing like being mentally and physically exhausted at the end of the day and crashing in bed knowing you got shit right.

Work outside of school

 * It's hard man work takes time from school work and from relaxing.
 * Do what you gotta do, but just remember you are working to get through school, not to get a better job at Joe's crabshack
 * Try and find a job on campus, they don't pay that great ($12/hr-ish) but it keeps you close to class, and usually they offer the opportunity to study while getting paid.

People upvote when they agree with you. Most people on reddit agree with Obama. Most people on reddit don't agree with Romney. It's fairly simple...,1
"I did not even come close to posting all the evidence I have of Romney not keeping his word, or how his word changes every few years/months/weeks/days. In stead I tried to keep it specifically on topic.  I can most assuredly prove that Romney is not a man of his word (even his own party mates were able to readily do this throughout the primaries).  It is not your personal trust in Romney on trial, it is his behavior and always has been.  

Also, you say that taxes will raise if Obama does nothing.  You already admitted that he was not doing nothing, and still have not given any reason as to why congress would let them expire also, when it is most certainly against their best interest.  

So, your beliefs are based on ignoring all evidence to the contrary, whether they are based on Romeny's behavior in the past, the opinions of people inside his own party, the opinion of both right and left wing media, financial experts worldwide, and a belief that congress will not act it its own best interest in the one promise that got the majority elected.

So, no, it is not your beliefs, it is your refusal to except anything outside of your beliefs, even though the entire world is seemingly against you.  That is why your arguments are so poor.

"1) I'm from Scotland

2) Not that I'm aware of - not on the ""main"" channels, anyway. It'll get a mention on the BBC News 24 channel, but not in depth. More like hey, Obama and Romney had a debate. Obama seemed to ""win"" that one, here's a 10 second clip of the debate.

3) Interestingly enough, the younger generation seem to be pretty clued up compared to the older. My dad is a super smart guy, but he doesn't know much about the presidential run this time round. Probably because the younger people have the internet and all the info about the campaign they want. People are talking about it online, and the younger ones are pricking up their ears. I say that like I'm an oldie, but I'm 20. I should mention, the 2008 elections were a BIG deal. I feel like I haven't seen near as much press cover for this year.

4) I do not know a single person IRL that wants Romney to win. Scotland as a nation is pretty tolerant of all differences and most of us do not take kindly to someone telling a gay person he doesn't deserve rights, or implying that poor people aren't worth his time. That man don't sound like he wanna be president, to me he sounds like he just wants to be king of all Londinium and wear a shiny hat. As for me... Obama isn't perfect, but he's a shiny light of safety and love compared to Romney.

5) Something interesting? I guess you could ask about my opinions about government funded healthcare. Personally, I love it. We have the NHS here, and it's my buddy. I pay tax, and I'm perfectly happy knowing that if I injure myself, I've got help there. I'm also happy knowing that someone who doesn't pay tax will have help if he injures himself, off the back of my tax. I would rather this person got help on my taxpayer dime than have him sick and scared because he ain't got no insurance. Having had the NHS all my life, the idea of being charged for an ambulance or lifesaving cancer treatment baffles me.

You can blame the Republicans for not compromising, some of that is fair, but a strong leader who had the oval office and both houses, should have done a lot more.

I'm convinced no that nothing substantial will change. Little rudder shifts here and there but the government is what is is regardless of who holds office those brief few years. 

In Romney I actually see change - a change from tax and spend towards a smaller government, more privatization, less regulation, broader trade, more productivity, etc. The best argument against Romney's economic policies is that he could lead corporations like a dictatorship but not government. Well, he was also a governor and, if you look at his record, he was pretty close to center rather than hard right.

He needs to run as a rightist as much as Obama needs to run as a leftist. If you don't have the conservative (Romney), or liberal (Obama)  vote, you'll lose. So they run on extremist platforms that they have no intention of following through with, thank God.

How do you know exactly what those people are doing?  Are you them?  Furthermore, are these people homeless now?  How exactly does someone simply quit looking for work unless they're loaded?

&gt; Unemployment peaked at 10% during his administration. It only went down because people are no longer looking for work.

Again, what are you basing this assertion on?

&gt; Correction: He flopped on the issue when he realized he would get more votes by doing so. He was in opposition to it for all but recently.

He's responsible for passing Don't ask Don't tell, and long before he came out in favor of gay marriage, he advised the justice department to stop enforcing DOMA.  Actions speak louder than words.

And basically you are the exact type of voter that I'd imagine who can be swayed by Romney's consistent lies. No concern whatsoever about the facts.  Just make up random speculation, and repeat baseless lies spewed by a man like Romney who literally stood on stage in a national debate and spouted one lie, after another, after another, after another.

"It's almost trendy to say ""I'm going to move to blah blah blah"" in the US.  It's become a way for people to express distaste with something, rather than an actual desire to move to a more progressive country.  

Generally the people who say things like this are just idiots.  For example, ""If that socialist Barack Obama gets elected again, I'm moving to Canada.""  derp

"Romney's record as governor of Massachusetts is pretty well documented, though he seems to backtrack on it on the campaign trail (since it's a liberal state that passed gay marriage and universal health care with his mild support).

When the election is an incumbent vs a challenger, I would suspect you don't need as much research on Obama, yes?

The basic grounds that Romney is challenging Obama on is a philosophical approach in the short and long term approach to the economy, he's advocating for reducing scope &amp; regulatory powers of the federal government and effectively taxing the rich less and deferring some to the state level whereas Obama continues to advocate infrastructure investment &amp; revenue increases (taxing the rich) at the national level.

Massachusetts should be a much more interesting microcosm for the election than it actually is, as it's a heavily democratic state that Romney served as governor as... yet that story line is almost entirely absent from the national news.  Odd.

Anyways, MA was in a big budget hole when Romney came in... and the state also wanted to legalize gay rights and get universal health care.  Romney gutted educational and public programs to stabilize the budget (as sort-of but not really advertised) with the arguably worst side-effect being skyrocketed university costs at the state schools, and passively signed on to gay marriage &amp; universal health care which were pretty successful (and later became the basis of so-called Obamacare).

You can argue the pros and cons, but the fact that Romney doesn't have a high approval rate in the state he governed in is really unusual.

I live in Massachusetts and witnessed him firsthand, so happy to answer any questions about his record here - but as a result I'm *heavily* biased and already have my mind made up.

"I'm curious, what qualifies someone as ""winning"" the debate?

From the comments it would seem the more charismatic and emotional arguments a candidate makes, the more likely they are to be declared a winner. I'll give it a Romney, he made some good points and spoke directly to the people's interests, but the lack of substance behind his claims is where I personally see him as losing the debate. Obama, many, many times, offered tangible evidence that they have a plan. It might not be the plan that is best, but at least he has one which everyone can go check and verify against his claims... that, to me, means he won the debate. Thoughts?",2
"I agree with you.  I would love to see Ron Paul debate Obama on that (and any constitution point since they are both brandishing the document as why they should be elected) issue.


As most Democrats are really conservatives/libertarians in the way of a smaller government.  Less spending on imaginary wars that cost a Pentagon budget of a half trillion dollars a year plus and got shit for reducing the Pentagon budget from 530 billion this year to 525 billion.  I may be wrong on the astronomical number but really does it matter.  Democrats/Libertarians want nothing but clear cut laws that no longer exist.  We live in an miasma of an age that is gone.  The Greatest Generation left us with an idea they never pursued to the letter.  Equality, Love of Liberty, and The Pursuit of Happiness.

What we were left with was fear mongering and degradation.  It works great until the dust settles and when it does Obama can be easily seen as a Constitutional Harvard professor that turned his back on this simple document.  He was elected with the backing of Goldman Sachs and a tribe of dedicated supporters that believed in the hope of another future.  A great coincidence of the time is neither Bush nor Obama could really be blamed for a massive crash in the American way of life.  Yet they both agreed that something was to big to fail.  Which makes sense since our stranglehold on the world is simple.  The British refused to go to the Euro for the same reason.  Germans are now kicking themselves in the pants and most likely blame the French for pushing it.  The British pound was once the only stable currency to exchange, and still is to the most part.  Germans are tied down to the Euro which they see as a bad deal now.  The dollar with a stable inflation has tied the world together for almost a century.  Colonial Empires do not die from armies or civil wars (look at Spanish gold and or the ruble), they die from no one wanting their currency/paper.


With this sad Bob Dole coming election we on the conservative side that must vote Democratic to save the Republic from outright Sharia Law in the form of a Roman Republic makes us all sad.


TLDR:

Cliff Notes version.  Simply as Americans we have the promise to live our lives without someone looking over our shoulder.  Hope was brandished in a political  campaign, the name of sanity and yet we have seen none.  We are left with the (maybe) Obama may not giving a fuck and starting to do what he said to begin with.  Republicans have doubled down on crazy.  It is a choice between Fascism light or Fascism hard but both come with killing families, Pakistani's, Afghan's, Iraqi's and now American's and those are just the one that hit the papers.  Now the skies are no longer safe from dissent.  Nor your family.  A child of 18 to 19 in Texas will be looking at a screen.  The innocent 18 - 19 year old ROTC that was recruited when they were 13 (that just wanted to fly) child that presses a button on the order of a ranking officer.  Questions do not exist, little but murdering several generations of family (He or she is innocent since that was an order from an old man with stripes on a shoulder) will get to live with pressing a button that wipes put 4 or 5 generations of people that are celebrating a wedding..


P.s. 

Almost forgot.  With the Pentagon Budget we could have free healthcare and education for everyone in America with a lot left over.  We are exporting more oil then we import at dirt cheap prices.  Yet we are stuck with a Russian/China/India/Pakistan complex that has been left over from the Cold War.

"Voting since you were 8?

&gt;But the one thing I don't agree with is when you suggest we are the system. I don't think the American voter has that much responsibility anymore. I think we're told we are through propaganda. I mean look at the party system.

The party system and its problems have been there for a long time. It seems rather Americans have the responsibility but are ignorant or irresponsible, and vote for bad candidates/parties over and over, when the options are there on the ballot (including ""write-in""). 

We are the system. Without our squishy brains no system. 

We believe in it whether we participate knowingly or unknowingly. 

Marx (no I'm not a Marxist) diagnosed this in the 19th century: The people do not know they are doing it, but they are doing it.  

Although, since then things have changed. Most people in western democracies are like you. They are cynical and they know *exactly* what they are doing (voting in a shitty system, not taking the minimal effort to mark a third party candidate or not vote at all; they are consuming too much, eaching too much, destroying the environment, jacking off too much...), but they do it anyhow.   

This situation seems more hopeless and certainly more self-deceptive as modern democracy has aged and grown cynical in the 20th century and 21st century.

If our actions didn't demonstrate our belief in the system, we wouldn't have the system we have. We *create* it with our actions and obedience to it. In denying it we also believe in it: Yeah, well, it's a shitty system, but... (Compare: The Chinese aren't the US system, because they are another system.) Each purchase with the dollar demonstrates a belief in the (economic) system. Each circle we fill in on the school/healthcare/voting/etc application demonstrates our belief in the system. 

Without our actions to produce it, there would be no system.  


&gt;So ultimately isn't the candidate we're allowed to choose from out of our hands?

Not if we don't vote for them. Each vote demonstrates it is in our hands.

Most of his tax arguments revolves around higher wage jobs. 90% of Obama's net 125,000 jobs created are low wage jobs. If you use the same wage level/tax formula, your right those numbers don't work. (not that you came to this conclusion yourself, you read it or heard it from a talking head).

I can only assume:

Romney's tax plan assumes that higher wage jobs, meaning higher revenue from the 50 - 75k group as it will be nominally higher though the marginal rate will be the same. I assume this stems from his 12 million jobs plan. If you look at Obama's recovery most of the jobs are low paying under employed jobs, so the numbers don't work with that formula.  ",0

"Totally disagree. Obama didn't clash with Romney. Perfect example- early on Romney talks about how the middle class has been hurt with what he calls the economy tax (the fall of median income, the rising price of gas and other goods/services). He put a dollar value on it--$4,000. Obama responds right back talking about he has saved the Middle Class an average of $4,000 in taxes. And how they have been able to use that money to buy Johnny a laptop or his first car. Or to help pay for college. At no point did he address Romney's economy tax at all or how the values were the same. If I'm a debate judge that means that Obama's impact (Johnny's car, his laptop, etc) isn't reached because the $4,000 dollars saved wasn't spend on those things, it was spent on rising costs. Whereas Romney's impact--that the President hasn't been doing enough to help the Middle Class at least on this issue is reached. 

It felt like President Obama was talking to the American People last night in a 2 hour ad. He didn't interact with what Romney was saying. If Romney was flip flopping like everyone seems to think he was, then why didn't the President call him out on it?

"Good point, I hadn't really thought about the kind of opinions that are detrimental to others, I think you're right about the fact that this kind of attitude is detrimental to society, especially in places like the US where it appears that such blinkered thinking is safe from questioning by taking various guises. 

However I think some elements of this are a bit of a grey area, some people might think that having a religious belief is 'wrong' in a sense, I think of the problems with (if we take the US as an example) how much of this comes under something like free speech?  

It appears that there are few clear boundaries on the notion of beliefs and opinions, what right do we have to take away someone else's right to believe a certain thing? Some philosophers like Mill refer to the harm principle in some cases, and I think when it came to promoting ideas like Obama is a (possible) non-American who hates America, that is clearly wrong and to a degree harmful and potentially dangerous.

But should an individual be restricted from believing such a thing? Would they not be covered by the First Amendment? (I'm not entirely sure about that though.) Make no mistake, I do see, understand and agree with your point, but I feel that we should be careful about breaching an individual's rights because they hold a belief/opinion that we perceive to be 'wrong'.

But then again as you say, it should be well thought out, I think we should challenge those who hold what could be considered 'ridiculous', 'harmful' or 'dangerous' beliefs and see how they formed them.

So no, I don't believe him when he says he can increase the military budget, lower taxes (especially on the rich), and yet ""we've gotta cut the deficit"". I don't believe that the guy who's bringing back Bush's foreign policy team has a plan for averting war. But mostly, I don't believe he really cares about the deficit, or about jobs, or about verterans or civil liberties, or any of it. I don't think he'd think twice about sending 10,000 of my generation to die in Iran or Syria to ""protect American interests"". I definitely don't believe he cares about people like me and whether we can find jobs or afford groceries.

Both parties' nominees came out in support of Puerto Rican statehood. Doesn't that say anything about the willingness of elected officials of both parties to accept the idea?

"I call someone who lies a liar. When a politician repeatedly makes false statements in front of a camera, and those statements are PROVEN false(as in, he says ""x happened"" and it simply DID NOT HAPPEN), and he refuses to take anything back and continues on with the same lies, he is a liar. When Todd Akin says ""legitimate rapes"" don't result in pregnancy, he is a liar. When Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney try to display Obama as responsible for things that happened before he even became president, they are liars. When schools teach children that the Loch Ness monster exists and is a dinosaur to support creationism, they are teaching lies. You could also call them fucking retards, but for the most part I find it more plausible that they are lying through their teeth and they know it. How do YOU define ""liar""? ",7

"As someone who used to work in med-mal defense (i.e., for the insurance companies), I can tell you there there is very little correlation between defense/settlement costs and premiums. Malpractice insurance companies (just like other insurance companies) charge the highest premiums they can get away with; it's a simple maximization of revenue calculus.  Just like medical insurance rates have increased exponentially in recent years (until Obamacare required that insurers commit large % of premiums to actual medical care rather than profits), greed - not lawsuits - is the primary reason malpractice premiums are so high.",5

"I'm of Irish descent, so I'll tell you true.  America is a pile of racist shit-heads who all have the mentality of every man for himself, but it wasn't always this way.  Once people of many cultures put their combined effort together to form a community.  They attempted to live in peace with their neighbors and make a life of it.  Now, television and media has warped the fucking soul of this country.  Reality TV isn't even about reality.  America is an illusion.  It is the thin veil that covers a mixture of varied peoples and all their problems and hatreds.  Fear rules now.  Obama care won't even address all health issues, I doubt there's even a clause for Dental.  I love that fat people can't be called fat, but I can still be called scummy for bad teeth and denied any treatment without payment.  I sit typing this with a swollen face from a tooth infection.  I'm taking fish antibiotics, because I pay $30 a bottle online, and to go visit a dentist, it's 90 for the x-ray and then 35 for the prescription thru a pharmacy.  So, $125 if I go thru their system.  Basically, America the experiment has failed.  Our government is locked in grid-lock and only passes these laws to appear to function, which then just roll up the prices for the consumer higher and making the bureaucracy larger and even less effective.

Obama at least came from a background I can more personally relate to. Lower middle class, made his own way through college and life. I've never even met someone who came from the kind of wealth and priveledge that Romney has, and doubt that most Americans have either. Not that growing up rich inherantly makes you a bad person, but I think with the way he grew up and has always lived he's just so far out of touch with people who actually know what it's like to worry about mortgage payments, health care costs, etc.   Just my opinion.",2

"Anyone who says Obama is a liberal president needs to have their head examined. He's a left-leaning centrist. He's given the military his full support and listens to his strategic and intelligence advisors implicitly. Economically, he's attempting to do what Clinton did in the 90s: invest in areas that will yield a return. Unlike Clinton, however, he doesn't have the cushion of cash that was given to him by his predecessor, so in order to make those investments, he's had to borrow a fuckton of money.

Short-term, it looks grim. Debt is rising and panic is setting in. Everyone is freaking out about expenses and they're rushing to cut everything they can get their hands on. But cuts don't fix an economy, and over time, investments *will* eventually get us back on track. It'll take a hell of a lot longer than it did in the 90s, but if congress can get its shit together and the Republicans can stop running around like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off, it'll pan out in the end.

Electing Romney is a panic response. When the ship starts to sink, everyone looks to the guy who looks calm -- even if he's only calm because he's on a ton of prescription meds. The guy flipflops worse than John Kerry and is such an obvious double-talker, it's shocking to think people would even think of him as a viable alternative.

Hence the Sherman Anti-trust act of 1890. It was made so that the government would recognize and split up monopolies, because free markets and competition are the **very soul** of capitalism.

 I didn't mean for this to be a rant, sorry. But I believe that government should encourage competition and free markets, not create self-mandated monopolies while wiping out major insurance companies and losing several millions of jobs.

"&gt;[Top 10: Toughest Gay Characters](http://www.askmen.com/top_10/dating/top-10-toughest-gay-characters_1.html)

&gt;Forget the stereotype. These tough gay characters kick serious ass.

&gt;By Ryan McKee ,

&gt;Page 1:

&gt;Fifty years ago, gay characters were limited to swishy men with poodles, who always seemed to show up just when a guy was tied to a tree and say, “Ohhhh, it’s my lucky day.” Thankfully, gay characters have evolved. They’re not just the quip-happy Manhattanites of Will &amp; Grace or Ugly Betty. They can be thugs, cowboys, Mafiosos, detectives, and teachers of wizardry at Hogwarts. Recently, even Stan Lee has announced he’s writing a new homosexual superhero. Thom Creed will be a high school basketball player who is forced to hide his sexuality as well as his superpowers. Gay characters no longer just provide a quick punchline or play the female lead’s best friend. Now they can kick your ass. In honor of June being Gay Pride Month, AskMen.com is honoring the strides homosexual men have made by offering up the Toughest Gay Characters to ever grace the large and small screens.

&gt;Page 2: Ennis Del Mar from Brokeback Mountain

&gt;After its release, the movie became a punchline. That doesn’t change the fact that Ennis is one tough cowboy. Just to think gay thoughts in Wyoming can still be a death sentence, and it especially was in those days. Yet, Ennis made out with Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) on his front porch, unfortunately in view of his wife. He falls on his head after a bear spooks his horse and it’s no big thing. Even though Jack is the bullrider, it’s never a question who the top is going to be. 

&gt;Page 3: John ""Sonny"" Wortzik in Dog Day Afernoon

&gt;This character has to make the list just because Al Pacino played him. To pay for his boyfriend’s gender reassignment surgery, Sonny robs a bank. It’s a strong and lovely gesture, however, he doesn’t do a very good job. The police surround the building, but Sonny’s boldness and charisma win over the crowd gathered outside. Based on a true story, the real-life Wortzik (John Wojtowicz) spent 14 years in prison for the heist.

&gt;Page 4: Keith Charles from Six Feet Under

&gt;Charles is an out gay cop in the Los Angeles Police Department for nine years. If that’s not tough enough, he beats a suspect so badly during a domestic violence call that he’s forced to resign from the force. After that, he becomes a bodyguard and even sleeps with a pop diva he’s supposed to be protecting -- just because he can. Eventually he goes on to own his own security company and settles down with his longtime boyfriend David Fischer (Michael C. Hall). Buff with anger issues, Charles is a ticking time bomb through the whole series.

&gt;Page 5: Lafayette Reynolds from True Blood

&gt;Growing up black and gay in a devote Christian, small Southern town, you’d think Reynolds would try to fly under the radar. However, he flaunts his sexuality with big earrings and overt flirtations. When rednecks give him guff, he kicks their asses. While working as a short order cook at Merlotte's, he beats up three guys at once. Also a gay prostitute and drug dealer, he sells ""V"" (vampire blood). That’s the ballsiest thing of all. Vampires don’t take kindly to it and you don’t want the undead on your ass.

&gt;Page 6: Eddie Dane from Miller’s Crossing

&gt;The homosexual love triangle between the hit man Eddie Dane, stooge Mink and bookie Bernie in this Coen Brothers film is subtle but present. The main character Tom tells Mink, “If Eddie Dane finds out that you got another 'amigo,' well, I don't peg him for the understandin' type.” The right-hand man to crime boss Johnny Casper, Eddie Dane seems to really enjoy his job killing people. Played by perennial tough-guy actor, J.E. Freeman, he coolly tells one of his victims, “Because if you told me and I killed you and you were lying I wouldn't get to kill you then.”

&gt;Page 7: El Nene in Burnt Money

&gt;Inspired by a true story in Buenos Aires, this film follows El Nene’s rise from petty thief to hardcore bank robber. After meeting his main squeeze Angel, the two hook up with a group of seasoned gangsters for a bank robbery. During the heist, Angel is wounded in the midst the crime by police gunfire. El Nene is sent into a fit of rage and mows down the guards and cops with his gun. While on the run, El Nene has a chance to escape without Angel but refuses to leave him. That sets up a gay version of the Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid ending scene. They go down shooting in a blaze of glory, surrounded by police machine guns.

&gt;Page 8: Vito Spatafore from The Sopranos

&gt;Hiding his sexuality with a marriage and kids, Vito enters the New Jersey crime family in his uncle’s crew. He quickly moves up the ranks to Capo by being a great earner and cold-hearted killer. When his cousin Jackie Jr. messes up beyond repair, he kills him without remorse. A whale, he loses weight in season 6 and gets frisky. After getting caught in a gay leather club, he goes on the run, stopping at nothing -- even killing strangers -- to hide out.

&gt;Page 9: ""Gay"" Perry van Shrike from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

&gt;Val Kilmer’s character is a private eye straight out of the film noir days -- except for the fact that he prefers the company of men over dames. Hired as a consultant to teach Harry (Robert Downey Jr.) who to act like a detective, Perry instead spends most of his time saving his ass from an ill-advised murder investigation. A cool character, Perry delivers justice with his Derringer. He called it his “faggot gun... because its only good for a couple shots, then you gotta drop it for something better.”

&gt;Page 10: Chris Keller in OZ

&gt;To write Keller off as just a violent sociopath isn’t accurate. While he murders at will and double-crosses his longtime lover Tobias Beecher, he’s methodical and fearless. Sent to prison for robbing a liquor store and killing the employee while trying to escape, its nothing compared to what he does inside the joint. Killing nearly at will, he keeps the Aryan Brotherhood in check and other prison thugs leave him alone. When he senses one lover isn’t being honest with him, he breaks his neck while the guy is blowing him.

&gt;Page 11: Omar Little from The Wire

&gt;What makes this stick-up man so badass is his discipline. He never raises his voice, never curses, and is the only character in the amazing HBO series about death, drugs and deception who lives by a strict, if abnormal, moral code. The closest thing to a Robin Hood character, Omar robs the biggest drug dealers in Baltimore with his sawed-off shotgun and merry band of gay thugs. This character is so feared, the streets literally clear when he walks to the corner store and dealers just toss their stashes at him without being asked. Barack Obama, a huge Wire fan, named him as his favorite character in the show. “That's not an endorsement,” he added cautiously. “He's not my favorite person but he's a fascinating character.”",6

As it gets more normal, this will just be seen as a normal part of a sex life in a digital age.

The tax increases that are coming in 2013 are going to primarily be coming from the end of the Bush Tax Cuts, which really don't apply to the american middle class.  They were just tax cuts for the rich, and the last time we increased taxes on the rich (During Clinton I believe) we had quite a lot of economic growth.

That said, the democrats don't have a super majority in the senate/house, so any radical legislature they try to pass can probably still be shut down by the republicans.",2

"Here's a few points from the perspective of a libertarian American:

1. I reject the idea that enacting taxes to fund services is ""caring for your fellow man"". When you enact a tax, you are using violence to take money (and thus, labor) away from people. I believe that such taking should be minimized, so that people keep what they earn. Caring for your fellow man is giving away what is yours, because you want to, without having to be forced.

2. I believe doctors have a right to market their services as they see fit. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe in Canada doctors are reimbursed in legally defined amounts by the government. (Ex. One check-up gets them $200 or something, no matter who the doctor is) I think doctors, who choose to invest time and money to become trained, should have the right to freely conduct business and sell their services for any price. I also think consumers have a right to pay more to get a better service. In Canada, you can't pay more, you just get on line. That's why Canadians with emergencies who are willing to pay come to the US.

3. When you place the burden of healthcare on the whole society, people's health becomes a matter of public policy. I recently lived with a Canadian chick, and she would often talk about how bad eating habits were a drain on the Canadian economy, because fatties would become morbidly obese and need tons of healthcare, which society has to pay for. She told me that Canada should enact laws about what kind of eating habits you can have, or put taxes on unhealthy food. Once the government takes over one thing, before you know it all kinds of laws and powers are required. I don't want my habits regulated. Nor do I want my life in the hands of bureaucrats. 

4. In general, I'm more open to things if they are done on a local level. Massachusetts has a kind of social healthcare going on, and it works for those people in that situation. I'm fine with that, because I know I don't have to live there if I don't like it. But huge Federal plans like Obamacare are destined to fail IMO. You can't administer the health of 350 million people from D.C.

"I don't think North Carolina voters will willingly overturn this. 

This is the sort of change that has to come from the federal level. The federal government has to step in, override all of these bullshit state laws, and stop letting people vote to deprive others of equal rights. You do not put civil rights to a popular vote. If slavery was put to a vote, slavery would still be legal. If Jim Crow laws had been put to a vote, they'd still be legal. 

Major civil rights victories do not, generally, come from statewide votes. 

This may piss people off who like to bitch about ""state's rights"", but fuck it. A state does have a right to deny equal rights to people. 

The end game here is not voting again in a state like North Carolina, the end game is the federal government passing a law to allow same sex marriage OR the supreme court making it illegal to deny same sex marriage. 

One or the other will happen within the next 10 or 20 years.  Hell, maybe sooner. If you had told me a week ago that President Obama would publicly endorse marriage equality I wouldn't have believed it. The good guys have all the momentum on this thing, despite the NC vote.",1
"They aren't valid unless you can actually demonstrate a logical progression from Point A to Point B.  

There's no reason to assume that allowing two gay people to get married will ever actually cause polygamy to become legal, or to allow people to marry animals, or to allow pedophiles to marry children. It doesn't follow logically.  

In the past, sodomy laws precluded a 'need' for allowing same-sex marriage, because those laws would have made it illegal to engage in the kinds of activities such a marriage would imply. Now that those laws aren't really on the table, and society for the most part accepts that gay people are having sex, and there's no real reason to prevent them from marrying each other and enjoying the same benefits we afford everybody else.  

Do you really believe that once gay marriage is legalized, society will also reverse it's positions on bestiality or pedophilia? That we'll make it legal to have sex with horses and children, and then have a need to re-work legislation to protect marriage rights for those people too? Do you have any kind of evidence to support the hypothesis: ""Allowing gay marriage increases social support of polygamy, bestiality, pedophilia, etc.?""

**Edit:**  Wow, I seemed to have touched a bunch of nerves.  I'll add this; 

I went to see President Obama talk at an event here in Iowa today - I've never seen a president before.  We stood around for two hours listening to a band a few warm-up speakers.  Halfway though Mr. Obama's speech, a whole pack of dudebros left, saying they'd seen what they'd come for.  All wearing the campaign stickers.  They knew they were going to vote for him, they didn't need to actually listen to him. So they left.  Too bad, because the president had some of his most rousing points at the end of his speech.

This was just barely enough time to pass the biggest and most difficult health care legislation in generations; an event that would likely never have happened under any other circumstances. This also happened under the onslaught of every procedural obstruction the Republicans could put in its path.

Third: Well, no shit that Obama opposed gay marriage until it was politically expedient not to. **That's how the game is played**. Welcome to politics 101. You can't accomplish everything all at once. Your choices are to proceed slowly, or lose. You are being delusional if you think otherwise. If you want to know what Obama's real position: In 1996, he supported same-sex marriage when running for Illinois Senate.

"It depends on your perspective.  I don't think he's a cartoon.  I think he just has taken a lot of positions that seem unpalatable to the average redditor.  This is my take as a somewhat moderate leaning Republican (undecided for this election)

Social Issues: Romney has clearly sided with the traditionalist/conservative wing of the Republican party.  For some people this is enough to not vote for him.  HOWEVER, the president will not be able to overturn Roe v. Wade, he will not be able to ammend the constitution to ban gay marriage, so I would ask: what's the big deal? Romney will probably rule much more from the center than his campaign suggests, so I don't think this should be a factor.

Economics: despite Romney's anti-china rhetoric, he will probably be a huge proponent of free trade.  If you think that's a good thing, vote for him.  If not, dont (although Obama is actually pretty much pro free trade).

Taxation: This is probably the most divisive issue between republicans and democrats.  What Romney wants to do - basically - is lower the overall tax rate and simplify the tax code to encourage growth, level the playing field, and try not to cut into revenue too much.  He's said that the tax cuts won't affect the deficit, but they probably will.  The question is simply how much.  Obama on the other hand wants to stick with the current tax code with 2 main caveats: 1. he wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest (millionaires? 250,000 and up?) 2. he wants to create incentives for corporations not to outsource (in my opinion a quite dangerous protectionist measure, but that's just me) 

Deficit: despite being more hawkish about cutting the deficit than Obama, Romney has taken some positions that make his views less realistic (like increasing military spending).

Health Care: Romney wants to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something similar but slightly different.  I don't know how realistic this goal is, given his other objectives and the fact that - once in office - Romney may about face and not make too many radical changes to Obamacare.

Foreign Policy: I don't see any real differences between the two candidates.  Romney will try to make Obama look weak on Iran, but both will probably react the same way to an international crisis.",0

Stop voting based solely on ideology and vote on results, for what policies work.  Become more involved in even if only on the regional level.  Remove the influence of big business on politics.  Democracy was great, and still is, it's just really starting to drift away from form the people, of the people by the people.

Theres a Tom Clancy book where the congress was wiped out and Jack Ryan says to the people regarding th eelection of their replacements, ""Don't send me career politicians.  Don't send me people who will just perpetuate the broken system.  Send me scientists, send me doctors and engineers and entrepeneurs.  Vote for what they can and have done.""  or something like that

People who complain about Obama being socialist and fearing communism, but love democracy really get me, cause guess what everyone being equal and having an equal say is pretty communist.

"Well, you should know that it's a very complex system.  Before the healthcare swap that Obama's administration pushed through, my family was doing just fine and had great coverage through my parents' employers where we only had to pay a 10$ copay for visits (pretty common for many in the white collar working world).  However, now we get a stipend through our insurance and are required to pay for 100% of the doctor visit.  When that stipend runs out, we are liable to be charged for the full price, up to a certain level where the insurance companies will step in and take over a significant percent.

Example:  I had cancer as a child and need routine followup every six months with three different doctors.  Cost?  Roughly $2,000 per six months.  Through our old insurance we paid the small monthly bill to the insurance provider (most of the bill footed by parent's company) and and $10 co-pay per visit every six months.  With the new system of insurance that we were forced into, we have to pay all $2,000 from our allotted stipend of about $4,000.  Once we reach that limit, we are forced to pay out of pocket until a higher limit is reached and the insurance companies pay more money on our behalf.  So now if my mother or father want to go get checked for something, it is likely that their visits will exceed our allotment, meaning they will have to wait.  Personally?  The Previous system is much better.  With the new system, you have families waiting to get check out medical issues until the new season and their stipends are refilled.  It's an interesting situation.

It was better *for my family* (note, not all families) before the new healthcare plan.  I totally agree that the system was and remains pretty broken for many people and am happy that at least some people are willing to work to fix it.  It's a process that no single decision can fix.  if it was as simple as ""let the gov pay for everything"" (which, for a country of 300 million people, it's not) then something would have been done by now.

Edit for clarification.",3

The Democratic Party doesn't like the idea, so it's not happening. And I agree with them entirely, it would be a stupid move that would weaken Obama and still wind up with him as the nominee. The only reason to have one would be if his approval ratings were like 10% or he was caught up in some type of huge scandal.",2
"I'm not sure, lets ask the people in jail/prison for possession if they would still have their jobs if they didn't touch pot. 

Before I continue, * correlation does not equal causation.* and I thought this thread was unpopular *opinions* not unpopular *facts*.

My ""data"" (Because seriously, data is nothing more than a LOT of anecdotes) is that 31 of my friends (above the age of 18) smoke pot. I just texted most of them and one has a job but he only smokes on his days off.

Five of those friends over the age of 21 don't have their GEDs. Only two are in college, none have degrees yet.

31 ""data"" points. How's that for evidence?

There are people who survive gun shot wounds, does that mean that when people die from gun shots those are just anecdotes? 

And yes, if you smoke marijuana and you get arrested for possession or you take a piss test and fail, you will more than likely lose your job. In the case of my friends, marijuana makes them happy with their lives so since they're happy living with their parents they see no reason to get a job and move out because they're happy where they are.

Marijuana use = Joblessness.

In 2007 almost 900k people were arrested for marijuana possession. Considering there's 16 million marijuana users in 2012, that's pretty close to 6% of marijuana users 12+ behind bars.

Now, 6% sounds like a that's not too much, but if EVERY redditor world-wide was able to vote in the US elections and EVERY redditor voted Obama, that would have influenced the election results by 1%. 

If one million people had bothered to show up at occupy wall street, that would have been less than .3% of the population, so 6% is a LOT. Especially when that's marijuana users 12+ so a lot of those users aren't even old enough to have a job.

And since I'm a huge jackass: 

number of people shot: ~65,000. 

Number of people killed: ~30,000 

So there you have it, if you're killed from a gun shot, you're not data, you're an anecdote.

And now I will end this post with: Correlation does not equal
 causation.


Edit: I just realized, I started my post with: **I'm not saying all smokers are like this,** and yet you still asked if there was any evidence marijuana causes joblessness.",1

"&gt;Do you think sovereignty of EU member states (like Finland, Denmark, etc) means slavery as well? The moment you try to say that increased local law-making = slavery, you lose the argument.

Why do I lose the argument?  We actually had slavery in states until the federal government passed the 13th amendment.

"Great question! I'm glad there's something I feel like I can actually contribute to. :P

I play keyboards in a band, and those things are hard to move in and out of venues. Moving equipment that is heavy and very sensitive up stairs and ramps is tough. It's a lot of work, fun, but a lot of work.

A while back I had a keyboard tech that I'd have to pay to keep around. Of course, that means I make less than anyone else because I was then splitting my take.

One night we had a show at a new venue that required a quick setup. My tech was sick and had been unable to make the trip. We were closing, so we were on at something like 10:00PM and finishing up the night, which meant we'd probably be going until 2:00AM or so.

When we arrived behind the venue there was a guy there wearing an Obama shirt. He was a little jittery but otherwise nice, and was obviously homeless. After talking to him for a few minutes I found out that the Obama campaign folks would pay homeless people to wear these shirts and walk around and be nice to people in the downtown area. One thing led to another and I offered to give him $50 plus two meals (late dinner and early breakfast) to help me load in / out. He agreed, then refused to let me or anyone else carry anything. The guy was stronger than a team of mules, it was like having 4 or 5 roadies.

The guy was a blast to hang out with and we learned a lot about him that evening. Heck of a dude. After all was said and done everyone else pitched in (because he'd helped them too) and the guy ended up with $250 to walk away with. After that, for nearly two years every time we'd play that town / venue this guy would show up and help out. The last time we did a show there we asked about him since he wasn't around, turned out he'd gotten a good job that required travel. He'd stopped by the venue the day before to tell the talent buyer that he was out of town and would miss our show. He sent his regrets... Haven't been back to that venue since, but I have a lot of hope that he's doing well.

Since I met Charles I no longer carry a tech or roadie and just take my chances on some awesome new friend to be available to help. If they aren't, no biggie, I could use the exercise.",2

"That the US is only at war with Iraq simple because of the fact that they control 90% of the worlds opium fields. Which is being heavily guarded even though Obama has claimed that the war in Iraq is over and has stopped pressing troops in the area. It has been researched and studied thoroughly through news reports and major broadcasting companies. Opium is used to make heroin which is the most addictive drug out there. One hit, and it's proven to be 100% addictive among its users. Making it the biggest drug trade industry in the world. Not only does the US military control this substance but also adheres to the highest amount of heroin being processed in the world. While Iraq has 90% of the worlds opium fields, the US is the sole leader and catalyst of the most heroin being produced and traded among its citizens. ",3
"The thing Americans don't seem to understand is that we've already had socialized medicine in this country for decades, and the current system is just a really shitty way of implementing it.

If a homeless man without insurance gets his face eaten by someone high on ""bath salts,"" that poor homeless man is going to get treatment, despite not being able to pay for it. The same thing goes for a minimum-wage employee who's limbs get mangled and who's employer doesn't offer health insurance. Hospitals can't refuse treatment in these life-threatening cases, but they have to cover those costs somehow. They make up those costs by charging even more those who *do have* insurance... so the insured end up paying for the uninsured.

No matter how you slice it, that's socialized medicine. So the question becomes this: what is the most efficient way to pay for these people who have no way of paying for themselves? Do you: A) have a system where for-profit, private insurance companies act as a middle man and siphon off hundreds of billions of dollars (and often deny coverage anyway), or: B) have a government run single-payer system similar to medicare for everyone (which is non-profit and operates on about a 3% overhead).

The Affordable Care Act (i.e. ""Obamacare"") is an attempt at a compromise between those two options, where the system is still implemented by private insurance companies (but they are limited by how much they can siphon off for profits/marketing), and buying insurance becomes compulsory for those who can afford it. I think it's a move in the right direction, but as we all know, there's a concerted effort to destroy it.

I'm probably joining the conversation too late for anyone to notice my comment, so hopefully all of these points have already been made (although, I haven't seem them in any of the top comments).",2

We know from recent experience that one of those leads to a larger deficit, and that the other is the aim of most western countries around the world, after shit-tonnes of research shows that is the way to make a country more prosperous.

Their kids look kind of latino-ish or ""jewish"" in their complexion.

I know my post might be very confusing with me throwing around all these ethnicities - and I apologize for that, but my point is simple: Black is a pretty wide term, especially when you consider that you can have a pretty dark-skinned parent and their half-white and half-black kid and have them both fall under the category of black when the kid is more brown than anything.",1

"I disagree.  Romney's campaign came off as very strategic to me.  We knew nothing about what he wanted to do before that debate.  He had given almost no specifics, that was his big criticism.  He hadn't put out any actual plan to fix things, and then Obama criticizes him on what little information we thought we knew about Romney's plan and boom Romney's just like ""nope, I'm actually gonna do this this and this"".  I don't get where people are saying he didn't give specifics.  He talked about exactly why raising corporate taxes on the top 3% of businesses is a mistake, he talked about all the public institutions he would cut and the criteria he would use to decide, and he tore apart what Obama has done in a clear and concise manner using numbers.  Those are just the first three that came to mind, but the first 30 minutes of that debate was full of ideas and plans on the Romney side.  I don't like Romney or Obama, but Romney's plan honestly seemed far more thought out than Obama's last night.

Saying that, this won't work next debate because now Romney's plan is in the open and he won't be able to jump on the president.  Also, I'm not sure why everyone thought Obama would win this debate.  It was on the economy, which is terrible.  Whether or not that's O's fault, it is very easy to criticize him about it.  When they get into social issues and foreign policies I think Obama will win handily.  Still, this was a game saver for Romney.",1
"&gt; anotherMrLizard said anyone who calls Obama a ""socialist"" is ""dangerously ignorant"", not that the act of describing Obama as such is dangerous in itself.

Right I understand that there is some distinction, but it is not such a big distinction as to make it seem a bit extreme to say that calling someone something is ignorant to the point of being dangerous ignorance.

&gt;In other words, if you think Obama is a ""socialist"" you are so ignorant you are a danger to yourself and others. This is a pretty fair assessment.

This depends some on how you define ""socialist"".  Does a socialist have to equal the extreme of the socialist party in a European country, or can it be enough to want to reduce the income disparity?",1

"I see your point, and I, as is everyone, am aggravated by the fact we were not allowed to see the pictures.

Personally, I think the burial at sea was more of an insult, that he will never be found, there will never be a grave for his admirers to gather, no dignity, no eternity buried near loved ones or fellow ''martyrs"", just crabs eating his corpse until there is nothing left.

So how do I know he is dead? If Bush made Obama's statement, I'd be leery. But for a first-term president to put his credibility on the line by stating Bin Laden is dead, it would be political suicide if it wasnt true becuase of the avalanche of backlash if another video of Bin Laden popped up with him reading the New York Times from this past New Years. There would be no chance of re-election, if not outright riots from such a blatant lie. It's one of those things that simply could not be claimed if it wasn't true. He didn't say we believed he was dead, it was unequivocal ""We killed him"".  And if we had already killed him, why announce it when he did? Why not when elections were coming, or any other time when he desperately needed the boost?

And the fact is the pictures were shown to a lot of people, our own elected officials ( which I admit carries little weight) but the leaders of other countries as well, including Pakistan, who we damn near came to war with over our invasion of airspace to pull off the mission. The last thing we needed, or wanted, was to risk war with another nuclear weapon country over a lie, especially when you consider the impact it would have on the region. (can you imagine how quickly India would jump on Pakistan to force the Pakistani's into a two front war? Especially after the Mumbai shit that went down, they are *itching* for another war). Then imagine the impact it would all have on the Muslim's world's take on it? Shit, their hatred of our interfering with thier lives is what led to 9/11, I cant imagine Obama risking all of this just to back up a lie about our killing Bin Laden!

Bin Laden is dead. He lived for years safely tucked away with the cooperation and support of a lot of people in Pakistan, which is why it took so long to find him.

Do I want to see the picture of him dead? Yes. Do I need to see it to believe he's dead? No. The fact that we have never heard anything stating he's alive (and we know damn well either he, or Al Queda, would love nothing more than to undermine the President by showing he is still alive) just further cements it my mind.


See, I'm not believing it simply because the government saysit's so, I believe it because it simply *makes sense* that they are telling the truth about it. There is no evidence to support he's alive, and there is no evidence that support 9/11 was aided by the US. Are there reasons to not trust the government? Of course! There are tons!! But just because a person lied to me a few times doesn't mean everything they say is the opposite of the truth. And I think that's a big difference.

I think the only issue regarding Bin Laden now is to get to the bottom of who exactly was hiding him, because those same people are probably hiding the rest of the group that we have been searching for all these years.

On a side note, the Muslim tradition is to be buried withing a day of dying.  Preferably, of course, on land. But for Muslim sailors it is acceptable to be buried at sea since historically a ship isn't necessarily going to reach land within those 24 hours. The claim was that they had all the DNA equipment to verify identity on that ship, and the intention was to verify difinitively that it really was him, then bury him in a Muslim-approved method with a burial at sea within the 24 hours. I don't buy it, as I think they very easily could have done the DNA in Iraq or other place, I think they just wanted to have his body dumped in a location where it could never be found. Not to hide anything, but as an insult to him, his family, and his followers. And I'm OK with that, although I wold still like to see the pictures. Maybe the next president will unseal them, or at least put a time limit on it.

Also, on another side note, it takes about 6 hours to fly from NY to LA, roughly 3000 miles, so 800 miles in 9 hours isn't much at all, the timeline does work.",1

"As a (fiscal) conservative on Reddit, I may as well be a foreigner, and I'd like to weigh in on this thread and ask some questions.

= For the commenters saying Obama being less of a bully... What's changed?  

He continued the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he escalated troop levels in both countries, he promised to close Gitmo for ages and four years later it's still open... Not to mention all the drone strikes and assassinations of U.S. citizens he's authorized.  

I think perhaps he has this image that he's more worldly and compassionate because of his manipulation of the press.  He gets away with literally bloody murder that a Republican rightfully would be nailed to the cross over, time and again, and people just dismiss it.  Hell, he was presented and accepted a Nobel Peace Prize for nothing.

=  Commenters saying he'd be better for the world's economy: The Hell?

I don't think Obama has been good for the country's economy, let alone the world's, I don't think he has a viable plan to turn things around, and I don't believe he's willing to make hard economic decisions on where to draw the line with our debt.  

Our country has had over three straight years of 8% unemployment, not counting those who are underemployed, or have dropped out of the work force like myself (I'm taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt to go back to college at 27, hoping things will be better once I graduate).  Gas prices have more than doubled, and with them, everything from food to clothes to electricity has increased as well.  After the housing market crashed and banks got stricter with home loans, rents shot way up.  I was making a middle manager's salary of $42,000 last year and I was living paycheck to paycheck, sometimes charging utility bills to credit cards whose balance I could barely afford to pay.  The employees I worked with who made half what I made were men and women in their twenties living with their parents, or in small apartments with several room mates and lots of drama.  Nobody in the lower and middle class is making it right now the same way the previous generation did.

To cap it all off, Obama increased the national debt by some $6,000,000,000,000.00 with his bailout and stimulus and national health care plan, raising it to total over $16,000,000,000,000.00.  IIRC, that's some $50,000 per citizen.  He keeps blaming Bush for the economy being so bad, but he supported the Bush policies that got us into this mess, and his own party lobbied hard against regulating the banks to protect their biggest donors, which was probably the biggest factor in the world economy going into such a terrible recession.

=  Commenters saying he's better for foreign relations: With who?

Iran is an oppressive police state that sponsors Islamic terrorist groups and sics soldiers with machine guns to spray into crowds of protesters.  Russia is the most obvious secret dictatorship that has ever existed and is helping Iran develop nuclear weapons.  China is making the worst abuses of capitalism possible to get ahead in the world economy, with what amounts to slave labor.  Yet people who are patriotic towards those nations seem to unanimously support Obama.

I don't agree with Mitt Romney on social issues, but Obama is bad for the U.S. and the world.  He is a politician in the worst sense of the word, and all he cares about is his image and popularity.  I don't think Romney is a trigger happy paranoiac who would start unnecessary wars.  Instead, I think he understands how businesses work, how the economy works, and how a government works.  And isn't that the key to making everything better?  Trade, partnerships, cooperation and shared prosperity, not empty promises from booming rhetoric.",0

I am not a fan of Obama fiscally. but i will say (as an active duty marine) I am very impressed by his foreign policy. He has done what has needed to be done, and is handling issues in a timely manner, while not jumping the gun.

Ended regional conference call, last one we will need to make. At this point we are basically just preparing for our last GOTV push. We have identified voters who are likely Obama supporters or are leaning Obama supporters in addition to not consistently showing up to the polls. Our job is to contact them and get them to the polls.

I am the hub director for the office so today I am sending out our volunteers to knock doors, give rides, and make calls. Spent most of the time between 12 and 2 preparing packets for easy use by the volunteers and getting their GOTV stickers ready. Then I took a three hour nap.

5 AM brought coordination with our advocacy lawyers. We have lawyers at every polling location to address questions, particularly ones concerning provisional ballots. However, since they are mainly out of staters from DC, many of them came down this morning as opposed to last night. Figuring out which precincts they needed to go to, which supplies they got, and other logistics was a nightmare that lasted about an hour and a half as many of the supplies were scattered across three offices across the county. However all is good, or currently being made good and our lawyers should be able to help anyone in the polls.

Currently I am sending out a few people to drive voters to the polls. Having walked the precincts surrounding our office since June is helpful for giving directions to the drivers. Superior ground game is something the Obama campaign has that I don't think will ever be matched by a GOP counterpart.

"Speaking as a democrat, my opinion of Mr. Romney changed for the better after the RNC.  I thought most of the speakers involved did a fair job, particularly his wife.

I also believe he has the potential to be moderate, and this is the tone I think the Republicans in general struck during the RNC.

Overall, while I will be voting for Mr. Obama, my opinion of Mr. Romney has never been negative - at best, it has been neutral.  The one major exception to this is the recent comments he made regarding the Obama administration's handling of the Embassy attack in Libya.

"&gt;From what I've read, though, this is directly due to the policies enacted under Bush, not Obama.

It has more to do with the Clinton Administration, to be honest. But you can read about that on your own. 

Obama (and Bush before him) use deficit spending to increase government programs and ""help"" people in need. This deficit spending, as opposed to reducing the national debt, leads to reduced demand of US Treasuries, and less confidence in the government's ability to honor its debts. 

This simple fact has far-reaching consequences: increased interest rates, inflation, inability to pay back foreign debts (and thus less foreign businesses coming to the US), unstable markets, etc. 

Rather than dealing with the national deficit, Obama has instead increased our country's debt, and wants to enforce regulations on industries that will only slow them down, and encourage them to go elsewhere. ",1

"Romney is far more competent. He has an actual resume and has actually proved he can work with the other side. Do you want things to get done in the next four years?

Obama blames his lack of accomplishment on the Republicans, but he entered office with a Democratic supermajority. The majority of Americans apparently didn't like what that supermajority accomplished because they voted in a bunch of Republicans the next term. Clearly, people wanted the President to work with the other side. Did he? He claimed he wanted to work with them, but sent a guy (Rahm Emanuel) who said ""We Have The Votes. F-’em."" Does that sound like an administration interested in inclusion and bipartisanship?

Obama's biggest accomplishment was Obamacare, which he rammed through Congress not only without any Republican support, but without giving his own supporters enough time to read the bill they were voting on. Is that how our healthcare system should be overhauled? 

Those in the know have been criticizing Obama's competence for a while now, but it's taken Romney's surge to really get the issue out in the open. And I'm not talking about tea party folks calling him names--I mean genuine problems with the fact that neither Obama nor Biden has a clue about business or the economy--or negotiation. Just look at Obama's past--what has he really achieved or proven? Despite being a professor, he's never published anything other than books about himself. As a Senator he voted present and carefully avoided taking a stance on anything of substance--or introducing his own bills of substance. He's never been an executive and he's never had to learn to negotiate or work with the other side. At Chicago he was surrounded by some of the greatest scholars of constitutional law in the country (titans in his own field) and they've said that he basically never spoke to them. As President, he calls CEOs and Boehner and various leaders to the White House, where rather than working with them, he lectures them. There's a reason he's accomplished very little.

This is all leaving out the incredible disaster that Benghazi has been. Don't let the fact the election has crowded it out in the news deceive into thinking the incident was one of the worst in American foreign policy history. And it was handled about as poorly as it possibly could have been.

Romney has been a wild success at virtually everything he's ever put his hand to. He's _far_ more experienced and he understands the economy and business in a way that Obama just doesn't. Most importantly, he has experience as an executive (in business and in government) and he's actually proven that he can work with the other side. And he's a genuinely good guy. Reddit loves Obama's pictures fistbumping janitors and playing with lightsabers and laughs at Romney's occasional awkwardness, but which is the one putting his money where his mouth is? Just read some of those stories in the above articles. Where are similar stories about Obama? Who has he personally reached out to and helped? His own ex-girlfriend called him ""aloof.""

So if Romney is more experienced, a better leader, better understands the most pressing issue of the election (the economy), and is the only one that has shown capability of working with the other side, I don't see much reason to vote for Obama.",3

i think a lot of americans who are already on ""free"" medical care envision themselves having the same care as private insured people when they have full obamacare up and running.  what they don't know is the long lines and the poor treatment and limited options are only just beginning.",1
So are you going to prove yourself and idiot and vote for Obama?,1
"&gt; He is 37% of promises kept. That is still an atrocious work figure.

Probably not if you're in a work environment entirely dependent on the cooperation of co-workers who are actively working against you. In that sort of environment, 37% isn't atrocious, it's a damn *miracle*. And it bears mention that Obama won with enough of a margin that it could easily be called a mandate, and that this was after the Republicans left him with a ruined economy and two highly unpopular wars. He had every reason to think that in the wake of their failure they'd be cooperative in the light of the nation clearly wanting to go in a new direction. But we all know how that went.

Edit: For comparison's sake, according to Politifact, in 2010, the GOP *as a party* made 57 promises, and they've already broken 19% of them (and only kept 19%). Again, this is a highly contentious environment, but the difference is that the Republicans *knew* the opposition they'd be up against, and they've been voting as a block so they knew their entire party would be backing them. And even with those assurances their success rate pales compared to Obama.

&gt; Also, 365 days in a year, not physically working days in the oval office. See his golfing trips, foreign summits and so forth. Not every day of his life is spent working.

Foreign summits *are* working. You think just because he's out of the country talking to other world leaders that that's not something he's doing for America?

Through 2011 (the most recent numbers I can find), Obama was on vacation for 78 days (By comparison, by that time in his presidency, Bush had spent 180 days on vacation). That means in Obama's first three years he was on the job for over 1000 days. Even if we assumed that he took every Saturday and Sunday off (he doesn't), that would still mean he worked over 700 days in his first three years. And that's not even getting into 2012.

Trust me, there's no way you can make your numbers work on this. They are very, very wrong.

&gt; The article I linked was an important thing. Border security is huge. But you are arguing these tiny points that don't matter.

Like the fact that the argument I was making was that Romney dismissed those saying that the numbers he was giving didn't work even though he refused to give details? That's not a tiny point. That's kinda' the *entire* point I was making. Not that Romney was vague (*everyone* is vague at some point regarding their plans, politician or no), but that he was claiming to perform some sort of impossible feat without disclosing how he'd do it, and dismissing criticism without anything to back up his claims.

&gt;GM is a very large company. Their employees span Texas, Maryland, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and many others. It is not one or two states, it is most of them!

So what you're saying is that their numbers are so diluted that even if he turned every one of them into a sure Obama voter, this would have absolutely no effect on the election whatsoever? I don't see how this helps your argument. At the very least if they were all in one place they might help to turn a single state. But distributed, their votes collectively don't mean a whole hell of a lot, especially when everyone around them is getting *more* upset with Obama.

&gt; The fraudulent claim that GM increased their own sales blah blah blah...

Okay, at this point, we're getting off the original topic, which was that Obama did something that was highly unpopular, because he felt it would benefit the country. At this point you are arguing details and semantics and none of it changes the fact that this *was* a highly unpopular move, and it *was* one that was done in the hopes of helping America.

&gt; Romeny didn't flip flop 4 times in 12 hours. You are reading a headline and not the article.

And you are reading a headline and not what I said. I never said ""4 times"".

We have one comment directly from Romney, seemingly running counter to everything he'd said previously about outright repealing the ACA, and making an exception for ""pre-existing conditions"". Then we have a re-affirmation of his earlier stance about allowing ""pre-existing conditions"" by a subordinate, Jennifer Rubin. As we know from Romney's comments on the Cairo Embassy situation, he considers any comments by a subordinate to be representative of the administration... so this is, by his own logic, a second flip-flop.

If the Romney administration wants to claim that the National Review Online is lying and that no such representative spoke to them, I suppose they could, but until they do so, I think it's safe to assume that this was probably a staff representative of his. No, news articles about quotes from a candidate's election campaign don't always include the name of the specific staffer that quote came from. And if this was false, why *wouldn't* Romney leap at the opportunity to cry foul about the ""Liberal media"" making up stories to sabotage him?

However, we've already established him flip-flopping *at least* twice in that 12-hour time-frame - once in an interview claiming that he supported a policy he was previously on record against, and then again when Jennifer Rubin reaffirmed that his previous position was the one that he had.

If nothing else, Romney has a seriously confused staff who is ridiculously poorly-coordinated. But given that right now I honestly couldn't say whether he is for or against keeping ""pre-existing conditions"", he clearly hasn't established himself firmly on one side or the other of this issue.",0

"Let me attempt to answer your questions in a way that is not condescending.

&gt;Often healthcare is tied to a job. Can employers decide freely, if they're offering healthcare, or is it mandatory by law? If they're free to decide, why do they offer it? And when you're insured through your job, does the employer simply cut your salary by the amount he pays for your insurance? Can you decline as an employee, because you have better/other insurance?

It is not mandatory by law. At least for a private company. They offer it because they want people to work for them. It really depends on the employer. Some employers will cover your insurance 100% where you pay nothing monthly, and you only have to pay your co-payments and whatever is the cost post-procedure like any other insurance plans. Some employers offer subsidized insurance plans where it's cheaper for you, but you still have to enroll and pay for it. It'll just be cheaper for you. Of course, you still pay for your co-payments and any post-procedure cost that insurance won't cover. Some employers take it out of your paycheck to make it easier for you, or some just let you pay how you want to pay. Like sending a check or something. If you have insurance elsewhere like through a spouse or something, they'd gladly accept your declination because that means that they don't have to pay.

&gt;If you're not insured through a job, you can obviously buy insurance yourself. Are there government regulations what must be covered in an insurance plan? Or are there e.g. plans, that are very cheap, but don't offer coverage for (some) serious illnesses or operations? Does the price of insurance depend on your age and health? And is the insurance company free to increase the price whenever it wants? E.g., you're diagnosed with an expensive disease, and the price goes up?

You can insure yourself if you can get a good insurance cheaply. Most people get it through their employer because it'll be subsidized. It really depends on the insurance you get and the plans you chose for what they'll do. They government is trying to regulate the private insurance companies to provide better health insurance and not turning people down. Some plans only allow you to be treated at a certain location. Like an HMO plan may tell you that you can only be treated, for anything, and be covered at a location that is 2 hours away. Some plans let you pick doctors nationwide that is in their network. Private insurance companies will charge you depending on your history, age, and maybe sex. If you have a known condition that they think will be costly to them, they will increase your rate. If you're in good health and everything checks out, you'll have a cheaper plan. If you're old, then you maybe charged more because old people tends to have more problems. But then again, old people are also covered by medicare/medicaid which are government funded health coverage. If you're diagnosed with a chronic disease that requires frequent visits, your price will increase because it costs the insurance companies money.

&gt;I've heard about insurance companies simply terminating the contract if you're diagnosed with something expensive. Is that really a thing? If yes, then what's the point in insurance anyway? How are these companies getting away with this?

That was before where a private insurance company can simply drop you if they think that you're going to cost them money. They could also deny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition. That's for private. That was fucked up and it created a big uproar because of it.  What Obama is trying to do is make that illegal. Government funded care coverage don't do that. Private companies get away with it because they have the big bucks and is very influential with their money.

&gt;A lot of people have no insurance at all. Are there any free or very cheap alternatives to get healthcare, like free clinics, church/charity funds or doctors? I've heard you can always visit an emergency room. But what if you're not in imminent danger, but need constant treatment because of a chronic disease?

There are government funded free clinics. There are non-profit hospitals everywhere that will care for you if you have no health insurance and are reimbursed by the government. A lot of non-profit places are church affiliated and that's where they get some of their money. Some hospitals are specifically there for people without insurance. Most of them are university research hospitals where they get some money from research funding, most from the government, some from insurance companies, and most from outpatient lab testing. My hospital that I currently work for will treat anyone without insurance because it offers its own subsidized health care. It will attempt to bill people, but if people can't pay, my hospital won't come after them for it. My hospital treats a lot of homeless people because we're located in the worst part of town. Of course homeless people can't pay, so the hospital eat the cost and make money elsewhere. Some hospitals are private, for-profit hospitals that will only take in non-emergency people with insurance. There is a law that prohibits any hospitals from turning anyone away for an emergency case. Hospitals will treat you first and ask for money later. For-profit hospitals will take measures to make sure you pay, but non-profit hospitals are more forgiving, especially if they get medicare/medicaid. If you have a chronic, constant disease, it depends on the hospital. Some hospital will outright refuse you. Some will take you in and make you pay in full after each visit, some will have a subsidized plan where you get a substantially reduced bill, and some will treat you for free when they know you can't pay. Some university hospitals will perform surgery on you for free because they need to teach their doctors and nurses. You also have to keep in mind that for some chronic diseases, you need to see a specialist. These specialists are often time in private practice and is actually not employed by the hospital they work in. They're just renting a space in the hospital. These doctors can decide if they want to treat you or not. These doctors like their big paychecks. Some hospitals require that a doctor offer some subsidized care if they want to rent a space. Some hospitals don't. Some hospitals have designated specialist employed by the hospital to care for these chronic cases that are subsidized.

&gt;Obamacare doesn't seem to be a new kind of insurance, but rather a bunch of measures to help people get insurance easier. Did I get this right? Does Obamacare just subsidize private insurance? How does it work?

I can't answer this. I'm sorry.",2
"I hear this from every group, but I think using yourself at the baseline for people who don't fit the stereotype is ridiculous.

"Yea. I know that I have explained the situation as it is(works well for the insured but not so well for the uninsured) people tend to be very surprised to hear that 86% of the country is insured and not really having problems outside of the rising healthcare costs everyone is experiencing. 

I have also listened to a lot of right-wing candidates and left-wing falling mostly as a moderate and I have never heard any of them claim that people here would die if we had a system like National Health Service. Some of the things they say can be interpreted that way but when you look behind the sensationalism that American politics have become they are saying something way less, for lack of a better word, retarded. Like the death panels thing. That is a sensationalist label put on a real issue the right wing has with Obamacare. Right now the marketplace decides what gets covered on insurance plans. With the birth control thing the government is opening the door for more of it to be regulated by a committee rather than elected officials or the market place. The right wingers would rather the market place with some restriction run the show. It is a lot more complicated than I am making it out to be but the whole concept got packaged into 2 words which get repeated everywhere and eventually make it overseas. Our system is so stupidly complex that even our own people can barely understand it at the best of times.

YEAH...Democrats running the country are doing very well. I worked my way up to a white collar position, but I used to be a blue collar worker for about 10 years. I think that any owner, regardless of their political agenda, is an asshole if they refuse breaks to people. With that said, I think you're an asshole and an idiot for believing that political agendas have to do with how a scumbag business owner operates.

The whole point of this topic was to question whether or not something was OK; it was not to insinuate that one political party or the other was responsible. You can show just as many instances of Democrats fucking things up as you can Republicans.

Here's an example of an asshole we had in Illinois as governor: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich

Oh, and the Republican before him, George Ryan, was sent to jail as well.

You see, an asshole is an asshole regardless of what they believe politically. So really, quit making this all about politics and let's focus on the issue at hand - the asshole running the company the OP was commenting about.",2
"No, I am saying that culture dictates the direction of the country under a democracy not kept in check by a republic. The culture is fluid and changes with pop-stars and works of fiction, so in 10 or 20 years with the expansion of media, there is no telling what could happen. All it would take is one mastermind social architect to make you believe something and within a few years it could become policy and be reflected in leadership. Democracy unbridled is dangerous because the people want a king and for every one super smart person there are 50 dumb-asses. Obama is a pop star king and people really love this guy. America should not be lead by a king, but a representative. ",1

So it is a line that constantly gets re-drawn. The constitution give a broad outline as to what the federal government should do and the rest in theory belongs to the states. But the outline is very broad so the fed and states each pass laws and some are fought in the courts with final judgement with the Supreme Court. Some issues get adjudicated more than once and so the line changes over time. Some items are still up to the states with the money provided by the federal government but nearly all the states take the money and agree to federal rules/oversight (interstate highways for example).  Recently Obamacare went to the Supreme Court and they decided it was a tax and thus a proper function of the federal government (the administration was claiming it was an interstate commerce clause activity and not a tax). ,1

There is no doubt in my mind that Obama is a deceptive liar. He ran on the idea of ending war, now he goes along with the war propaganda and initiates acts of war himself, hes playing on the border of being impeached and rand paul is one of the few people trying to stop him.

I halfway think Fox News is just seeing how much support it can astroturf up, but that's another issue. 

Anyway, Santorum and Gingrich have come as far as they have by appealing to a VERY vocal fringe element and make everyone else cringe. Romney WOULD have the most broad-based support among the current three except he is the LEAST popular with the loud Christian fringe. Basically, no one will go out of their way to vote for him, but lots of Obama supports are still devoted. 

BTW, I have strong ties to Florida, Alabama and NY, so I think I have a pretty good idea of where people stand in very diverse areas. 

TL;DR - Santorum and Gringrich are jokes, and Romney isn't inspiring anyone to actively support him - in the meantime, all Obama supporters are terrified shitless of the prospect of any of those three taking office. So no, no chance. ",2
"[](/flutterwink """")First, an upgoat for posting ponies.

Why not Romney:

1. He doesn't seem to have a real agenda beyond getting himself into power.  He's basically running against his record as governor of Massachusetts, saying that he'll do the *opposite* of what he did there as President.  I just don't buy it.  
2. His running mate proposed perhaps the most monstrous budget in recent history, gutting pretty much all social program spending (yes, that stuff is important--it's what keeps looters out of your house).
3. I am unconvinced he *has* a plan for anything.
4. It would encourage the crazy wing of the Republican party and demonstrate that their obstructionism works.

Why not Obama:

1. *He* gave us pornoscanners and gate rape, not Bush.  No, Congress had nothing to do with that--it was the DHS all the way, baby.
2. I find his handling of the mandate to provide birth control with respect to church-operated but not church institutions (hospitals, other charities) to be questionable.  
3. I'm unconvinced that his economic plans are actually good ideas, but I'll concede that he has plans.
4. I am increasingly uncomfortable with the social left.  I'm unconvinced it makes people better, but instead simply *encourages* the innate tyrant in all of us.

There are other candidates.  You can vote Libertarian or Green, though I find both to be more repugnant than Romney or Obama, as the Libertarians don't care much about protecting minority civil rights, and the Greens are more socially left than the Democrats (something I'm just not okay with--I'm admittedly a social conservative and fiscal liberal, and no, I did not mean the other way around: give me lots of social programs, but don't take my proverbial kids).

Obamacare would be forcing Megan to pay (with money that she doesn't have) for an insurance policy that wouldn't cover her serious bills. You people think that Obamacare is 100% coverage. No way. It is juts like car insurance. It requires you to buy at least low level insurance. Low level insurance covers things like one doctor visit a year and a few thousand in hospital bills.

A president cannot be elected with only 13% of the country's support.

Also, keep in mind that Americans are serious about their political parties. I seriously doubt a Republican would vote for a Democrat candidate (or vice versa) solely based on race/religion.

Now, he presents himself as a moderate, the defender of Medicare against President Obama's ""gutting"" of the program, isn't going to decrease the amount of taxes that the wealthy are paying, WILL cover pre-existing conditions, and will embrace Simpson-Bowles (something that his running mate destroyed as part of a bipartisan committee to figure out the debt problem).  

The reason Obama lost is because he prepared himself to fight back against the candidate that we thought we knew over the past 1.5 years, but instead ran into a brand shiny new candidate who is supposedly a centrist and couldn't deal with it on his feet.  Romney was either lying for the last 18 months and moved to the center, or last night just became a liar and will move to the right once he gets elected.  If you do a little research, Romney is today backtracking on some of the bullshit he was spouting last night.",2
Is your password really Obama? Or are you just lying to us?,1
That's all that really separate the candidates: social issues. In almost all other areas they are the same. In the US we choose who's rhetoric is closest to our heart. Romney is a 1 and Obama is a 2. On a scale of 10.,1
"I don't think anyone won, I think the country lost. Mittens is an idiot and couldn't go 2 minutes without contradicting himself or talking around all the holes in his plans. Obama at least has plans, but they aren't really that great of plans either.",1
Not me but my cousin who is a doctor would be taking a 20% pay cut if Obama wins. ,1
"Alright, I just wanted to make sure. Didn't want you to be persuaded by the hivemind. The media can be really biased too, so try to research online for straight facts.

Romney flip-flopped on the issue of abortion, tax cuts and the Health Care Refrom (Which he approved when he was a governor), among other things. I feel that Obama flip-flops, but do you think he flip-flops for the popular vote?",1
"I'm saying, to me, there is a place which most people have. A soft spot in their hearts and minds, which allows them to do things they wouldn't normally other wise do. 

From a day to day standpoint, we all keep up a poised, honest exterior. We all think everything should be fair; people should be honest, no one should cheat or kill another human being. Many public figures base their entire persona on looking like a nice, honest, clean cut guy. 

But under that persona is the real person. A person who says it's ok to kill, or cheat or undermine ideals of fair play. This notion also extends to the realm of cheating. 

See, I am a cheater. I am also married. I have not ever cheated on my wife, but I have the potential to. Because, I, like most other people have that grey area. That place where cheating becomes OK in my eyes. And not just OK, but even justified. 

I realize that it's not OK, to according to society, to be a cheater. So I have to hide that grey area. I have to keep it hidden because I have to appear to be a normal, nice guy. I also realize, in that regard, I am living a lie. I am NOT a nice guy, I have the heart of a cheater but will deny it because society frowns upon it. 

The issue comes down to what I already said: 

**The very meat and potatoes is the fact there is a place where personal reason trumps society's rules.**

This applies to everyone. Politicians do it all the time. They say one thing to appear to be a nice guy, but then you get shit like Obama signing NDAA 2012 circumventing the Constitution. 

As I said. and I still believe it. But allow me to clarify it a bit more. 

Fuck it, let's just admit the truth. Sometimes, oftentimes, our personal actions (in our own mind) cannot be held by societal standards because we believe we are beyond them. Or simply put, when I do bad shit, I'm above the rules. ",2
"Romney will probably win the nomination, Obama will probably win.",2
"It's a fair question.  Republicans believe that Obama's policies are harmful in the *long run*, promising levels of government spending that are unsustainable without strangling the economy.  So their view is: his policies are very popular with voters right now, but down the line our children will have to pick up the check.  So there's no immediate political advantage to doing what you suggest.

And I'm not saying this is true per se, just that it's their opinion.",2
"I identify as Christian and I think Obama has been a terrible president and that Romney would do an overall better job.  I think Neil degrasse Tyson is okay, but reddit tends to over-appreciate him.  I think SRS is just a slightly more extreme version of the reddit hivemind, not its opposite.  I also think that Ron Paul is actually quite sane (unlike many upvoted unsupported comments).  I think that slut-shaming (for the lack of a better term) is more beneficial for society than thoughtless sex-positivity.  I also haven't really played many video games since the 90's.",1
"i totally understand that this is written from a pro-Obama standpoint and i apologize for the fact that i am too lazy to go find a better, less biased source, but i read this article recently and there are actually some really interesting facts that i didn't understand before i read it. Also it has sources.

"There certainly are a lot of very unhappy non-liberals here complaining about how their opinions are not accepted.  I haven't been here for very long, but like everywhere else it seem like people here equate opinion with fact.  Mostly what I see here are statements like ""Obama sucks!"" or ""Obama's a Socialist!"" or ""Obama is worse than/the same as Bush/Romney/Hitler/Stalin/Beelzebub!""  When asked to support their opinions with any kind of facts or reason, you are accused of wanting to have sexual relations with him.

Opinions without supporting fact or rational explanation deserve ridicule.  It has nothing to do with free speech or censorship or the overused ""hivemind"".  You are free to express your opinions here.  If you cannot defend them you should expect them to be criticized.  If you can't handle that, maybe you should keep them to yourselves or express them over at places like freerepublic.com that will confirm your bias for you without asking for you to do a little work and back up your opinions with rational arguments.

"The OP mentions voter fraud.  Do you think Obama, his team or his devotees would conspire to commit voter fraud?  (Notice I didn't say anybody else has; I'm asking OP's original question, whether Obama is capable of rigging the election, and Reddit is just suppressing the indications that he might be.)",1
"There is no other reasonable choice when the opponent he is running against is so backwards. Mitt Romney is a representative of the Republican Party, and the Republican Party has been catering to the most extreme sections of the far right wing in order to garner votes. A vote for Romney and the Republicans is a vote for their oppressive policies against women and their right to choose, it is a vote for their archaic and bigoted views towards homosexuality, it is a vote for their disdain for affordable health care, it is a vote for their outdated tax policies that favor only the richest Americans, it is a vote for their denial of climate change, evolution, and science in general, it is a vote for discredited and dangerous imperialistic foreign policy, and it is a vote for economic policies that favor only the people at the top. 

President Obama is not perfect. He has bent too easily to Republicans on many issues, he has not been as transparent as he promised in the 2008 campaign, we are still in Afghanistan. But he tried his best to pass affordable healthcare legislation, and what he accomplished may not be perfect but it is better than nothing and it is far better than what any of his predecessors managed to do. He is an undeniably intelligent person, which is important. He claims not to support gay marriage, but he did manage to get Don't Ask Don't Tell repealed and he does not advocate oppressive and restrictive policies. He is in favor of womens rights and fought to make sure their needs were met by health insurance companies, despite resistance from the Catholic Church and other far right lobbyists. He will certainly be better for the environment, he has a more reasonable foreign policy perspective. 

Also, he had Bin Laden killed. That was pretty cool. ",-1
