Thank you.,1
"&gt;""None, I just took my son but I'm an Atheist"". They become confused and don't know whether I'm a good person or a bad person.

I would say to chalk that up to the ignorance of the particular person.  There may be many people in a particular church community that simply do not have atheist friends or family, so the concept of a person who does not believe in God is completely alien to them.

Catholics are often told, ""You are the only Gospel that some people will read today.""  Meaning, of course, that *we* are the examples of Christ in the world, and we have to remember ~~what~~ Who it is we represent.

In the same way, if you are striving to be a *good person* as an atheist, then you have to be ""atheist gospel"" that people will read.  Understand that ignorance exists, and show them who you are and what you believe.

I have quite a few friends who are atheist.  Some of them are *incredibly intelligent* and I am able to carry on intense philosophical discussions with them on the nature of God, beauty, truth, and goodness.  One of them, in particular, is a chemical engineer - with an intellect that simply dwarfs mine.  Yet he and I share *many* similar moral views.  He reaches the same conclusions I do through natural law, while I use natural law *and the understanding of my Faith* to enlighten my intellect.

&gt;There's some that have made my son really upset saying that I was going to hell. 

**No one** in the Catholic Church - or any church body for that matter - has the *authority* to say that you are going to hell.

The reality is this: *we are all in danger of hell*, especially when we treat people like you with disrespect and do not give you the dignity, love, and respect you deserve.

&gt;Part of me is hoping that he turns back from religion before he finds out the true dark side of religion...

Or the true dark side of *human nature*?  ;-)
 
&gt;You're not the problem of religion, but you do give the power of abuse to those evil guys that are in religion.

I respectfully disagree.  I work and volunteer for my Diocese, and I am involved in the screening process for finding volunteers to work with children and youth.  We take many *painstaking steps* to ensure that the Catholic Church is the *safest* environment for children.  And thankfully, my Diocese in particular has already uprooted and brought criminal charges against quite a few guilty adults.

There will *always* be evil people (or rather, ontologically good people who do evil things) in the Church, just as there will *always* be evil people in the world.

But do not misunderstand my implicit trust to mean that I am going to immediately going to trust a complete stranger with my child, or with some of my most intimate secrets.  No, not at all.

It simply means I give the stranger the benefit of the doubt in charity until I am proven otherwise.

&gt; Some of those boats took over a year to get back into the fight. I completely disagree, Pearl Harbor was a crippling blow to our battleship fleet, which even though they were obsolete still played a major role in shore bombardment and were a projection of American naval strength.

Eh, maybe. I'm not saying it was good, but if the difference was between having the US fight WW2 or not fight it, the sacrifice was a minimal one compared to not fighting at all.

"&gt;Manning has always said(in logs of chats before he did anything and to this day in court) that he did it because he believes the American public has a right to know about the abuses, the apparent attitude of the military towards human life, and about basic misconduct being covered up with unwarranted classification

So his idea of doing all of that is to dump a metric shit-ton of information, including some that is unrelated to all of these injustices? That's a big problem that I have with his story. I would favor him more if he wanted to specifically expose abuse of power, but he pretty much exposed everything he could access with a TS clearance. Also, war is ugly. Lot's of bad things happen. People are supposed to die. The good news is, that the military has to follow Geneva Conventions, LOAC, and Code of Conduct. If anyone disobeys these treaties there are a very special group of people called Inspector Generals that would *love* to know. 
That don't take any kind of shit lightly.
As far as ""unwarranted classification,"" it is not up to me, him, or anyone else to decide what information requires a Top Secret clearance to access. He had no right to pretend he did.

&gt;That said, I don't deny he seemed disgruntled, but according to his logs it was because of the way he was treated by the military and his fellow soldiers. Being a disgruntled whistleblower doesn't make you any less of a whistleblower. It seems all whistleblowers are disgruntled, in fact.

 I think the thing we really disagree on is just intent. I don't think his true intent was to actually expose war crimes based on his actions, not words. 

Personally, I feel that this could have all been prevented if his leadership cared enough to involve themselves to some extent in his life or interests. He exhibited plenty of warning signs of being emotionally unstable at the time, which is a shame. His leadership failed him.

"The American Intelligence infrastructure is royally *fucked*.

It is so very fucked.

The British have two primary agencies: MI6 and MI5-- both of which fall under the oversight of the Joint Intelligence Committee IIRC.

MI6 is primarily foreign intelligence; MI5 primarily domestic (though they do carry out functions over seas).

Nice, clean, simple.

Meanwhile, over in the good ol' U.S. of A., we have a veritable alphabet soup of agencies which are so bogged down by protocol and convoluted interactions that they can't even formulate a legitimate role which is not also partially filled by various other agencies.

To illustrate: here is a link to [Wikipedia's list of intelligence agencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_intelligence_agencies#United_Kingdom)-- note the difference between the UK and US.

Life and opinions are nuanced. And if you read a little closer, it's not strictly about intelligence, it's about empathy. It's easier to empathize in some situations, and with some animals, than others based on many factors (e.g., culture, the creature's intelligence). Further, the affective response is generally not something entirely under one's control (let us please avoid a maddening descent into determinism).

Let's be explicit. Based on my understanding and personal experience with different creatures, I find it easier to empathize with a mentally handicapped human than with a dolphin which is easier than a bear which is easier than a cat which is easier than a chicken which is easier than a pigeon which is easier than a goldfish which is easier than a jellyfish which is easier than an ant. This isn't just an intelligence issue, it's a range of issues, but intelligence is a factor *for me* in empathy inasmuch as it makes the target of my empathy more relatable. Don't think relatability should factor in to empathy? Well, psychology is a bitch sometimes, and I won't apologize for it.

&gt; I'm very confused why the intelligence of the living thing is supposed to make me feel more sorry for its suffering.

Dandelions are living things. Do you feel sorry for uprooting it? Probably not, in part because it has no intelligence or self-awareness, and maybe somewhat because it's not unique.

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuke

Trinity was *the very first nuclear device in existence* and it was built in *1945*. Science has come *a long fucking way* since then and nuclear devices are old hat. The only thing difficult about making a nuke is getting the fissile material and enriching it enough, with is a long, laborious process. The bomb itself is relatively easy to build. Every country that has nukes has been able to miniaturize them within a few years of their initial test device, and North Korea is certainly no different.

&gt;What is stupid about it? It would be an actual test of a nuclear warhead and delivery system. 

Because you don't know a thing about North Korea and what their game is.

&gt;Skulking around insinuating you have a capability and never demonstrating it, is a horrible deterrent.

That's why they conducted underground tests like the rest of the world, then came out and said they have nuclear weapons. You probably have no idea there's a global atmospheric test ban for nukes for some time now.

&gt;It backfired on Saddam and has failed to stop Iran from sending Hezbollah and Hamas to bomb Israel.

Saddam never even came close to having the capability and Israel's nukes are for when their neighbors attack them, which is bound to happen at some point when the world tires of their bullshit.

&gt;however they are about as substantial as any schoolyard bully would be.

And that's why you're ignorant. They are a *huge* threat to South Korea and a moderate threat to Japan. They could potentially win the peninsula or at least wreck the south by trying. Millions would die in a matter of weeks. One of the world's biggest economies and one of the world's most heavily populated areas could be ground down and turned into a war zone. If you think that's not a serious threat, you're a fucking moron.

&gt;They will do damage to SK, maybe Japan or the US however they can't prevail in any meaningful sense.

And that's that hubris talking again. You honestly have no clue about any of this, or warfare for that matter. The US's war plans write off Seoul and the surrounding area as a given loss in the initial days of an outbreak of war. If they don't get bogged down in the Seoul area, they could sweep the peninsula long before the US can mobilize enough troops to stop them. The South Korean army is poorly trained, poorly armed, and most importantly, poorly motivated. They pretty much aren't even paid and hardly any of them actually want to be in the army. They would fold under the slightest bit of pressure, because they know they'd be fighting against brainwashed zealots who would gladly die just to kill them. They are in no way analogous to professional armies like in the West.

&gt;Attempts to screw down an occupied south would utterly wreck what didn't get flattened in the attempt to take the south.

Maybe, maybe not. The point is that by the time they go into occupation mode, they will have killed millions of South Koreans and the war would be over as they would use their nuke card to bring the US and pals to the table before they can stage an invasion. I can't imagine *that* many South Koreans resisting once the US ends its involvement. The North would likely kill every man of military age they see. They can do that because they're a cult and traitors are basically devil-worshipers.

&gt;Their entire country hinges on the support of China.

Again, you're showing your complete ignorance on this subject. They *don't* rely on China, and the events of this year have shown that they are not playing according to China's playbook. All China wants is stability, plain and simple. If the war is quick and over, they would be happy.

&gt;China giving NK a green light would undermine everything that has happened in the country since 1990.

They're not in a position to direct North Korean traffic. They haven't been in such a position for decades.

&gt;So I guess China could let NK go wild on SK, but doing so would utterly gut the Chinese economy.  It doesn't mean much to have massive factories all over when you have no way to trade what they produce to anyone else.

That doesn't make any sense at all. It would be a boon for China's economy as it would eliminate all their South Korean competitors.

"There are some Kurds among the Syrian rebel ranks; however, the majority of fighters are in the YPG. Though the YPG has joined with other Kurds (who are anti-YPG) on the side of the rebels for Geneva II, this is likely due to the requirement that there only be two sides, and that neither the Islamic Front nor Al-Nusra or ISIS is represented.

Though there are Kurds in Al-Nusra and other Jihadist groups, the YPG would not ally with Al-Nusra due to continued conflict in the north with ISIS and aligned Islamist groups. Meanwhile, what's left of the FSA is too weak to fight against Al-Nusra who would likely have the support of ISIS as well.

Recently the Syria Coalition declared that the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) is an Anti-Syrian Revolution Organization: PYD's ""actions represent collusion with the Assad Regime regardless of their slogans,"" ""represent(s) a separatist movement"" and a ""a supporter of the Assad regime and a participant in its military wing""

* Salih Muslim (leader of the PYD) recently said that any solution to the Syrian crisis must include Assad because his removal would result in a genocide against the Alawites.

* Supposedly, the Iraqi military, Kurdish fighters, and the Syrian Air Force coordinated to take Yarubia (border crossing to Iraq) which resulted in the SNC issuing a statement of condemnation against the Iraqi military.

* I can't help but think the PYD and SAA reached some favorable outcome regarding the Kurdish areas of control in Aleppo.

* Assad has released Kurdish political prisoners.

* The Syrian Air Force has not attacked Kurdish ground positions although the PYD and YPG do not have strong anti-air defenses in comparison to FSA/ISIS/JAN/etc.

* ISIS and aligned FSA factions have been waging a war against Kurdish areas in the north and have caused a significant amount of Kurdish civilian deaths.

* Assad has recently gifted YPG rebels in the north 200 surface-to-air missiles, as well as Russian tanks and artillery pieces to help them against Jihadists. This would help to deter Turkish intervention, bolster YPG firepower, and reveals a degree of trust as Assad is the only player with an air force in Syria.
https://medium.com/war-is-boring/37068b3cabf9

Obviously the statement that they are ""a supporter of the Assad regime and a participant in its military wing"" is an exaggeration. The Kurds are acting out of self-interest and with all the hostility from the rebel side their choice is obvious, even more so now that the government is gaining momentum in several key areas of the country. They want to be in a position to negotiate favorably when the time comes.

Though there were clashes in the initial part of the conflict in 2011-2012, government forces quickly withdrew. I have not seen evidence that the YPG has engaged the SAA in 2013, though they have shown some limited cooperation.",3

"Europe is a big place, so is the US. Even Japan has rural, urban, rich, poor, etc. divided along economic and geographic lines...

Like if you're talking about Spain or Greece (PIGS, + southern nations who are doing poorly) then you can compare those to our states/counties/cities that are doing poorly, and then we have places like, say, New York, which could be compared to London, in that big disparities exist within the city and surrounding area because money from the respective finance industries only partly makes its way around town. Place like, say, Minnesota or something, which have strong senses of community (high rates of civic participation, community service, low unemployment, high happiness index) can be compared more to places like, say, the Nordic countries.

"from the perspective of somebody vehemently anti-gun (ie me, if it's unclear), I wouldn't say being gung-ho about guns would necessarily make you more likely to kill somebody intentionally, per se. HOWEVER, I think a *responsible gun owner* would very well know the laws about using guns (in situations such as home invasions) and would not have such an itchy trigger finger as somebody in the general population who has never used a gun. Plus the whole ""shot four times"" thing, I don't know, it seems like something a rookie like me would do rather than something an experienced gun owner, to the extent of owning multiple firearms, would do accidentally.

"A little bit of a half truth, there.  [For the majority of Taliban rule, there was no attempt to suppress poppy cultivation](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/66062000/gif/_66062704_afghan_opium624x389.gif), until [the U.S. and the UN offered Mullah Omar some incentive to outlaw it](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/20/world/taliban-s-ban-on-poppy-a-success-us-aides-say.html).  The Taliban is definitely not the most just group, but they are pretty effective.  For a single year poppy cultivation was almost nil in Afghanistan, and to reiterate, this was at the behest of the U.S. and the UN.

Then we invaded, and the cultivation immediately began again like nothing ever happened.  It could be guessed that the cultivation didn't really ""stop"" it was just put on hold, as poppies can last awhile after harvesting without ""spoiling.""

ISAF forces do recognize that the poppy is used to fund most of the insurgency within Afghanistan, and [drastic steps were taken in the mid 2000s to halt all poppy production, slash and burn, basically](http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0516/p07s01-wosc.html).  But, of course, if you take away a man's only way to survive, you're not going to win hearts and minds.  That strategy was soon scrapped, and now [Government programs like switching poppy farms for ever expensive saffron crops have been put into place](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2010/0610/Why-some-Afghanistan-opium-farmers-turn-from-poppies-to-saffron), offering subsidies to farmers who switch to saffron.

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/world/europe/europes-shrinking-military-spending-under-scrutiny.html

&gt;Even as Britain and France have boasted of operations in Libya and Mali, those interventions have revealed Europe’s weakness more than its strength. In Libya, the United States supplied intelligence, drones, fighter and refueling aircraft, ammunition stocks and missiles to destroy air defenses, and in Mali the French required American intelligence, drones, and refueling and transport aircraft.

&gt;**Senior American officials have warned that unless European countries spend more on defense, they risk “collective military irrelevance.”**

&gt;**A senior American official said that Washington was eager for partnership in the Middle East and Asia, but that “Europe’s decision to abdicate on defense spending increasingly means it can’t take care of itself, and it can’t be a valuable partner to us.”**

&gt;While the United States would like to be able to rely more on its European allies, many experts doubt that even the strongest among them, Britain and France, could carry out their part of another Libya operation now, and certainly not in a few years. Both are struggling to maintain their own nuclear deterrents as well as mobile, modern armed forces. The situation in Britain is so bad that American officials are quietly urging it to drop its expensive nuclear deterrent.",1

When you say ""...Yacuiba is in the state of Tarija - which is a state where the national government has real meaningful power."" does this mean that as far as classifying cities and such that Yacuiba is a nation that is ruled by the state of Tarija which is in turn a nation of Bolivia? 
 
Do I have these definitions correct? (NOT CALLING YOU STUPID OR WRONG)

Nation = Group defined by sharing a similar language (pronounciation and such), history, and beliefs

State = Governing body over a certain geographic area

Strangely enough, its the opposite of the US definition

"I'm sorry, but let me educate you.


In 1930's Germany, during the rise of Hitler, many, many Germans had a similar anti-Semitic state of mind. Many Germans blamed the Jews for the loss of WW1, and were near enough absolutely, well and truly bent straight out of shape at the idea. Skip some of the story, Hitler took his place into power, where he took out that hate in a way no one else could foresee.


Skip to today, where no educated person on this planet, let alone Britain, seriously believe that it's only Muslims raping children. Sure, Muslims receive a bad rap for some events in recent history, but the overall consensus is that the people causing the trouble are cunts to begin with, it's not a culturally exclusive thing. Americans have bombed people, Britain has bombed people, Russians have bombed people, Christians have bombed people, Hindus have bombed people, and holy tit wank, so have Muslims.


In conclusion, no one who has half a brain gives a fuck that the guys who raped this kid are Muslims except the deluded retards who subscribe to the EDL or whatever far-right wankfest is currently trendy for those chavs.

If your email archives are in O365 &amp; you/Microsoft get subpoena'd then you're at the mercy of someone else. Microsoft won't break the law or even work with you; they are limited to what they're even able to disclose to you the end customer.

I could also see them refusing assistance despite having nowhere near the infrastructure available to deal with a Chernobyl-style disaster than what the Soviets had.

More importantly, if there was a massive disaster at Yongbyon along the lines of Chernobyl or [Fukushima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster) it could result in a massive humanitarian disaster for North Korea.  The Chernobyl accident scattered extremely high levels of radiation well over 100 miles from the plant.  Fukushima has high levels 50 miles from it.  Yongbyon is only around 50 miles from Pyongyang.  If the conditions were right and a nuclear accident at Yongbyon was severe enough then it could potentially render Pyongyang unsafe for habitation.

Israel's policies to displace Palestinians from Area C are well documented. See [here](http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_area_c_report_august_2011_english.pdf) and [here](http://www.maan-ctr.org/pdfs/Eyeon%20theJVReportFinal.pdf).

The intention is evident: Israel wants to keep as much as possible of Area C under any agreement, and for that to happen, the Area needs as many Jews as possible, and as few Palestinians.",2

"*I posted this as replies to both of you so that the discussion keeps going*

It's nice to see this discussion is still going!

Some points I'd like to address: 

rainkloud, you still didn't address the point about houses costing large sums of money. Where are people to get this money if not from banks? And then, if these people end up not being able to pay off these loans, you'll blame the bank for loaning it to them. If the banks don't give them the loan, you're going to blame them for not helping people get a house. 

It seems like you are thoroughly biased against the banks, as if there's no situation in which they may not be at fault. 

&gt; As to your first part, the banks will continue to loan because that's what they do to survive.

Why would they loan if they have no collateral? In an extreme hypothetical scenario, here's how I see it going: 

Person A wants a loan for $100,000. The bank says yes. 

Person buys house with the $100,000 and then decides NOT to pay the loan back. 

Bank can't do anything; no collateral, so they can't take the house back. 

See how the system could easily be abused? There should be collateral, which is the risk the lendee's (?) takes when asking for a loan. 

&gt; It was excessive lending that got us into this mess in the first place so a little less won't do any harm.

It's not a matter of reducing excessive loans by a bit. It's a matter of reducing excessive loans to NOTHING. Such a drastic measure would surely collapse several sectors of our economy.

&gt;the best move would be for the banks to simply work with the distressed owners and renegotiate. But every report I hear indicates that with few exceptions the banks are entirely unwillingly to renegotiate.

That's probably because the 'owners' have nothing to renegotiate with. (I.E. no steady income or way to pay back the loan anytime soon). However, I am not as familiar with these 'reports' as you are. 

Your last major point seemed to be that the buck should stop with the creator. 

You do understand where banks get their money from, right? They get it from the people; if the people don't want to use the bank's system, fine! But don't blame it on the bank when the people 'creating' the goods abuse it. 

Also, your analogy of an auto manufacturer does NOT seem to hold up. The auto manufacturer is giving a physically defective product, which is NOT the same as money. Money is the same; $20 is $20, regardless of the lender. On the other hand, a rusty engine != a shiny new one. 

You also seem to disregard the fact that people have to GO to the bank in the first place to get this done. This means that the people are the ones who put themselves in a bad position in the first place, yet the bank takes the majority of the risk by putting out the loan. 

And finally, you are going on some tangent about citizens &gt; banks. 

You understand banks are made up of citizens, right? And that businesses need to grow for their employees (other CITIZENS) to prosper. You are looking at a bank like a faceless institution, instead of looking at the fact that it has several employees. 

ALL of this last part is disregarding the fact that the economy is a REAL THING. When you look at people and their comfort only, you ignore real economic effects. This kind of extreme thinking is what would lead to economic collapse and disaster. 

Also: 

&gt;You sound like an intelligent person whose been given some biased information that's led you to some dreadfully incorrect conclusions. I appreciate your eagerness though so I'll provide you with a link that will explain about as well as any out there how the crisis materialized and the overwhelming responsibility that the banks have in it.

"I shall paraphrase horribly; ""It's that good people don't do anything, that evil fuckers succeed."" It's not enough to just be a good person, to pay your taxes, be a ""good Joe"". We live in a world of chaos and it has evil in it. First we must be vigilante against the evils that can crop up inside of us. Then we have to keep an eye out for it wherever it has the balls to show it's face, and promptly stomp the fuck out of it. 

We have to watch the watchers. We have to allocate some of our time to do our due diligence as good citizens of the world, and not fuck it all off watching TV or sports, or whatever. Freedom is never free, ever. There is always a fucked up price to pay for it.

"&gt; Your source has been refuted and debunked. By John Hopkins University. Self funded research of Dr. Eran Elhaik destroys without a shred of doubt the myth created by the zionists about their history.

Ok. Firstl, Elhaik is an extreme minority position, almost all geneticists who've studied this have reached a consensus opinion, and if you want, I can point to many similar results than the first one I linked. Second, you can't say a source ""debunks"" something which it doesn't even cite, or refute. You could say at best that it offers evidence in the other direction.  Third, claiming that the mainstream consensus view is a ""myth created by the zionists"" makes no sense when the standard traditional narrative which predates Zionism by hundreds of years is in agreement. 

Fourth, Elhaik's work is impossible to reconcile with the standard historical consensus (based on non-genetic data) that only a small fraction of the Khazars converted, primarily nobility.  Similarly, there's no evidence whatsoever of any largescale migration from the Khazar areas into Eastern Europe and we have a lot of documentation both from Eastern European Jews and from Christian interaction with them. And it completely fails to explain the presence of [Kairites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaite_Judaism) in Eastern Europe. That's easily explainable by the standard consensus narrative, and makes no sense under the Khazarian hypothesis. 

Fifth of all, and most importantly, there are massive problems with Elhaik's own work, in that he's interpreting true evidence as showing things it just doesn't show. For example, he uses as a comparison group the Armenians, a group known to have large Middle-Eastern ancestry. So using similar as evidence is at best confused.  Razib Khan discusses this and further related issues [here](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/08/ashkenazi-jews-are-probably-not-descended-from-the-khazars/#.UcRv-vnVBOU), and I strongly recommend you read his piece.

All of that said, if you remove all of the evidence that doesn't show what Elhaik says it does, and take all the other issues into consideration, what he does present is evidence that can be reasonably interpreted that there is some genuine Khazar heritage in Ashkenazic Jews, which, if true, is actually really interesting.

But one also shouldn't lose sight of another more basic issue: [About half of Israeli Jews are non-Ashkenazic or have non-Ashkenazic ancestry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Jews), so even if one bought into some version of the Khazar hypothesis, the claim that "" most Jewish Israelis are of European decent, and not Semites"" is at best extremely misleading, since even if you buy into that more than half are of non-European descent, in addition to being of European descent. See the problem? 

&gt; There is actually no such thing as a jewish race. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsqvWKTrsLg

Your video offers no new evidence and is essentially a propaganda piece. It also isn't terribly relevant. What people mean by ""race"" is an extremely complicated question. One can just as well not have a ""Jewish race"", whatever that means, and still have most Jews be of Middle-Eastern descent. Asking about race in this sense is almost completely a confused question. 

At another level, there's something already going wrong when this question is used as a proxy for who has rights to land. It really isn't helpful or productive to assign rights to land based on vague are hard to test historical hypotheses. I don't think for example that if Cathar descendants in France today started trying to form their own state, anyone would take it seriously. Similar remarks would apply to say Cartharginians or a number of other groups. Attempting to establish legitimacy or illegitimacy of some status quo by reference to genetics is already failing.  And of course, none of this is relevant to my point about the abuse of etymology which you didn't address. ",6
"This is a very misleading title. Way to go, jerk.",1
"""Even if the government is wrong by a huge margin, and it is only 20 terrorists they are releasing onto US soil that is still an unreasonable risk, especially when we could have given them trials to determine that guilt.""

So the other 80 percent should suck it up and bear their persecution because the 20 percent might be guilty?

There needs be a consequence to government for shirking the rule of law, but more importantly there needs to be recourse for the wrongly handled. It is absolutely unconscionable for someone to be held prisoner in abusive conditions while the government twiddle their thumbs at the notion of building an actual case against them, FOR A FUCKING DECADE OR MORE. Jailing someone justifiably while investigating them for a specific crime normally comes with presenting cause based on evidence to do so. Even people jailed for investigation of murder in this country are normally afforded such rights. Without charges, they are set free because the standard at hand amounts to having some affirmation that there is a sustainable case for holding them in jail. 

After all, you may have committed a felony some time in your life. Mind if we lock you up indefinitely while we leisurely look for a reason to justify it?

It doesn't happen to everyone, for starters, and in most cases it's not a 1:1 of expected, normal sensory input but a feeling of pain, discomfort or itching that is now attributed to [the reoganization of the somatosensory cortex](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7777055) as the brain tries to reconcile the loss of the limb. Even patients that do experience to complete phantom limb syndrome as you describe it [don't always do so as you'd expect.](http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com.au/2012/03/woman-who-grew-phantom-fingers-that.html)

The brain is adaptive, but not perfect.

Sure, there's not a set limit of nerves required to feel pleasure and you can certainly achieve orgasm with a reduced number, but you've failed to prove there's no correlation between number and experience.",0

I'm not extremely familiar with the other things that the breast cancer foundation has done (I've heard they've tried to sue because others have used pink) but looking solely at their budget it seems like they've been very successful and have done well in regards to the total amount of money given to research (although it is a small percentage of their total earnings).

"Political Poker. NK is realizing that they have killed the golden goose of concessions and are ratcheting up their game.  They Chinese want some buffer and counterweight in the area, but it is becoming clear that such buffer comes at a cost if they cannot keep the N. Koreans under control,. Without control over the nuclear card by China.. the N. Koreans  are a loose cannon in playing their part in the region.

They have pushed very far and w/o concessions they will have to lose face in stepping back. This is the reason for constant escalation of the claims.

S. Korea is not about to accept the behavior that occurred in the past. Expect immediate retaliation if the North attacks any part of the South. SK is led by a very tough woman and any stepping back is seen as a sign of weakness on the part of this leader. (And judging by the relative physiques of the leaders she can go chest to chest and push back harder.)

The guided missile destroyers are in place to bring down anything launched. The USS McCain is flying a Battle Ensign which means it is on wartime steaming alert. Most likely to be able to respond any alert that a launch is taking place and bring down the missile ....even if it is aimed out to sea. This event will be the deciding point. Either NK goes ahead with further actions that require a strike or the escalation stops.

I expect that the Chinese will cross the border if a response by SK or the US leaves the NK leadership in a vacuum. Probably to provide a warning after the initial strike.

It would be a better solution if China facilitated the reunification of NK with SK .

At peace with a reunified Korea would allow drawdown of US forces in Korea... a situation that China would like. Korea as a whole would be preoccupied with feeding the North and establishing order. China would be free of the financial support of the North. China already has a significant trade with S. Korea. Expect that to rapidly expand. ",1

1. Governments main role of defending their people can be downsized to policing the global world since if we no longer had countries the threat of a foreign invader is near 0 and any real threat would come from rogue/terrorist organizations. (for those of you who are about to downplay the terrorist factor, I understand that Reddit is mainly American and Australian and therefor isn't as effected by terrorism as the rest of the world.)

1. It would be easier to international laws since they will abide everywhere as opposed to abiding to countries that ratified the laws.
1. I realize that wealth is finite but people seem to think that this means that for people to be extremely wealthy some have to be extremely poor but there is a way to somewhat amend this. The most valuable asset isn't a mineral but rather human capital. At the end of the day, humans decide the value of everything. Without us, diamonds and gold would just be shiny elements in the earth's crust. Humans turned stone into the pyramids, daily practices into math, and silicon &amp; electricity into a computer. At the end of the day, our potential is infinite. The fact that such a large percentage of the planet is prohibited by circumstance from achieving that potential is sad. Not just because they won't get a chance to fulfill their potential but because the world can be missing out on another Ramanujan. 

At the end of the day though, which government would want to lose its power to further humanity? I agree with Bruce Bueno De Mesquita's point that all leaders do whatever keeps them in power.

But much like how you don't seem to be able to understand that the USSR was not the United States' ally during the cold war, you don't seem to have much understanding of just about anything.

"&gt;No, if it was pre-emptive, wouldn't he have shot the burglar before he was robbed or pistol whipped.

That would have been a pre-emptive attack to prevent the robbery.  That's not what I was referring to.  I was referring to this statement.

&gt;If some scumbag maniac gets what he wants with you and your family, now knows where you live and threatens to come back or can easily return, you have to wait for them to return hoping you are ready otherwise as they are leaving, you can be imprisoned for defending yourself and your family?

With this statement, you are suggesting that after a crime has taken place, the victim should be legally allowed to take pre-emptive measures to avoid being re-victimized at a later point in time.

&gt;This is what bothers me so much, because I guess the crime is over then? 

No, the crime isn't over then.  As some people have stated, apparently the thief was holding a gun to this guy's head at some point.  Shooting the thief at that point would have been completely justified and no one would be arguing otherwise.  However, by the time the thief was fleeing, the jeweler's life was no longer in danger.  Therefore, a response of deadly force was no longer justified, even if the crime was still being committed.  

&gt;So the second he turns around, he can just walk away like nothing happened, and the victim can't do anything without the threat of being imprisoned with other similar violent criminals.  Is it like a video game where your wanted level just disappears and everyone can walk around like nothings happened?

There's so much going on here.  No, it's not like a video game where your wanted level disappears.  You know why?  Because the thief is still a wanted criminal.  If the cops catch him, he will be arrested.  So no, he can't just walk away like nothing happened, but that doesn't mean the jeweler has carte blanche to kill him.  There's a difference between what the police are allowed to do and what the general public is allowed to do.  I don't know why you are unable or unwilling to acknowledge that difference.",1

"&gt;But what should be done then?

Well, if you're a sociologist, then first thing you need to do is to visit the ghetto.  Live there.  Learn the ghetto language and try to understand the ghetto dynamics and mentality.  Then bring your learned wisdom to the policy makers.

And if you're a policy maker, then you need to listen to immigrants who've been inside and outside the ghettos, listen to sociologists, listen to what all the educated and experienced people have to say and make decisions that are both compassionate **and** pragmatic.  Otherwise you end up with what I call ""idiot compassion.""

Throwing money at the problem is often compassionate up to a point.  But if all you ever do is throw money at a problem and then say, ""My job here is done, I just tossed some money your way... now I wash my hands of you.""  Then you're demonstrating ""idiot compassion.""  Money and material help are important.  But so is the social and mental help.  People need help adjusting to the new environs.  There have to be ways of doing it.  Sometimes that means giving a compassionate kick in the arse by forcing some family to move out and live among the locals for at least 6 years I would say.  Let them learn to live in the local culture.  That's my advice.

But really, obviously there are lots of wise and compassionate people out there.  The problem is real, and if the racists are the only ones who talk about and acknowledge the problem, then as a society we all lose.  The non-racists must have the upper hand in this discussion, and the only way it will happen is if we take off our PC goggles and start to look at the situation on the ground.

&gt;The only way to ensure that they don't form self-induced ghettos would be to create laws that restrict where they can and cannot live

For the first 6 years, say?  Sounds reasonable to me.

&gt;but that would be opening an entirely new set of problems that likely would not be any better

"William Blake was very anti-establishment religion during his lifetime but he was not persecuted.  Neither did Emerson, Lizst held contemporary religious views either.  Brahms didn't write sacred music because he was forced to.  In fact he broke away from much of the convention to express his own views about his religion.  I can say the same thing about Emerson and many other prominent thinkers/writers from 18-19th century.

You criticize religious people for not thinking critically, but it seems like you have no problem making logical fallacies like making sweeping generalization, using straw man argument, and cherry picking evidence.  How ironic.

"&gt; Doesn't your post contradict itself? McCain had a long record and lots of experience and would have done it as well.

You have to actually look at the record of what people have *done*.

* Are they claiming they will implement massive ""reforms""?  What does their past history show... have they *actually* implemented such reforms in previous/lower positions?

* Claiming they will ""balance a budget"" or ""reduce waste""? Again what does their history show... have they *actually* proven they have both the ability and tenacity to do this with some other (major) bureaucratic entity?

You see, it isn't the *quantity* of experience or the *length* of the record, it is the **quality** and the **nature** of their past actions that reveal what they are *likely* to do in the future.

It's still not a guarantee, but generally speaking its a pretty darned good indicator... far better than ""swooning"" over a bunch of rhetoric.

Now, during the patient intake at the psych facility, there were typical medical release forms, authorization to provide treatment, etc - the same forms you'd sign to accept treatment at any other medical facility. 

I signed those forms without issue, partly because I wanted treatment, and partly because they told me that it didn't matter whether or not I actually signed them, I'd be processed in anyway. Once admitted, I filled out a Discharge Against Medical Advice form (to allow me to leave immediately following the three-day period mandated by Colorado law).

Despite having signed everything willingly, it still shows up as involuntary. Could signing the discharge form have caused that distinction? I'm just curious.",1

"I don't agree with your interpretation. The full paragraph you're citing from:

&gt;**The existence of the world we cannot – and should not – undo, and suicide is not an option**. The best that we can do, according to Schopenhauer, is to liberate ourselves from suffering by denial of the will-to-live. That is the road to salvation. Will has the power to freely abolish itself. Schopenhauer refers to this as the euthanasia of the will (see Schopenhauer 1966, p. 634–639). Here we have a certain kind of Schopenhauerian theory of moral development. It is a road from suffering to holiness and self-denial. Schopenhauer claims that mankind has two ways to liberate itself from suffering and needing: art and morality. With art we can achieve only momentary liberation in a form of aesthetic consciousness, which is quickly followed by a return to mundane suffering.5) Only morality, which leads to a total denial of the will, can guarantee ultimate liberation, but only a few of us can achieve it.

Read in the context of the paper as a whole, Schopenhauer is saying that all suffering derives from will, and to remove all suffering, one must remove will; to become, as it states, ego-less. Further, that in doing so, one becomes the perfectly moral being. This does not happen through study or effort, however, but rather through intuition. He does not advocate for suicide, instead he argues that one must remove personal desires to achieve a perfect moral set.",1

"It is not merely the faith or oil that flows out of Saudi Arabia. The oil-rich Arab state and its neighbours are busy financing Wahabi and Salafi militants across the globe.

**A recent report by the European Parliament reveals how Wahabi and Salafi groups based out of the Middle East are involved in the ""support and supply of arms to rebel groups around the world.""** The report, released in June 2013, was commissioned by European Parliament's Directorate General for External Policies. The report warns about the Wahabi/Salafi organisations and claims that ""no country in the Muslim world is safe from their operations ... as they always aim to terrorise their opponents and arouse the admiration of their supporters.""

The nexus between Arab charities promoting Wahabi and Salafi traditions and the extremist Islamic movements has emerged as one of the major threats to people and governments across the globe. From Syria, Mali, Afghanistan and Pakistan to Indonesia in the East, a network of charities is funding militancy and mayhem to coerce Muslims of diverse traditions to conform to the Salafi and Wahabi traditions. The same networks have been equally destructive as they branch out of Muslim countries and attack targets in Europe and North America.

"[""America,""]( http://www.thinking-approach.org/index.php?id=376 ) he said, ""will lose the war. And Italy will win it""
   ""America is the strongest and most prosperous nation on earth,"" Nately informed him with lofty fervor and dignity. ""And the American fighting man is second to none.""   
""Exactly,"" agreed the old man pleasantly, with a hint of taunting amusement. ""Italy, on the other hand, is one of the least prosperous nations on earth. And the Italian fighting man is probably second to all. And that's exactly why my country is doing so well in this war while your country is doing so poorly.""   
Nately guffawed with surprise, then blushed apologetically for his impoliteness. ""I'm sorry I laughed at you,"" he said sincerely, and he continued in a tone of respectful condescension. ""But Italy was occupied by the Germans and is now being occupied by us. You don't call that doing very well, do you?""   
""But of course I do,"" exclaimed the old man cheerfully. ""The Germans are being driven out, and we are still here. In a few years you will be gone, too, and we will still be here. You see, Italy is really a very poor and weak country, and that's what makes us so strong. Italian soldiers are not dying any more. But American and German soldiers are. I call that doing extremely well. Yes, I am quite certain that Italy will survive this war and still be in existence long after your own country has been destroyed.""   
Nately could scarcely believe his ears. He had never heard such shocking blasphemies before, and he wondered with instinctive logic why G-men did not appear to lock the traitorous old man up. 
""America is not going to be destroyed "" he shouted passionately.  
 ""Never?"" prodded the old man softly. 
""Well..."" Nately faltered.   The old man laughed indulgently, holding in check a deeper, more explosive delight. His goading remained gentle. ""Rome was destroyed, Greece was destroyed, Persia was destroyed, Spain was destroyed. All great countries are destroyed. Why not yours? How much longer do you really think your own country will last? Forever? Keep in mind that the earth itself is destined to be destroyed by the sun in twenty-five million years or so.""   
Nately squirmed uncomfortably. ""Well, forever is a long time, I guess.""  
 ""A million years?"" persisted the jeering old man with keen, sadistic zest. ""A half million? The frog is almost five hundred million years old. Could you really say with much certainty that America, with all its strength and prosperity, with its fighting man that is second to none, and with its standard of living that is the highest in the world, will last as long as... the frog?""   
""Well, frankly, I don't know how long America is going to last,"" he proceeded dauntlessly. ""I suppose we can't last forever if the world itself is going to be destroyed some day. But I do know that we're going to survive and triumph for a long, long time.""   
""For how long?"" mocked the profane old man with a gleam of malicious elation. ""Not even as long as the frog ?""  
 ""Much longer than you or me,"" Nately blurted out lamely.    
""Oh, is that all? That won't be very much longer then, considering that you're so gullible and brave and that I am already such an old, old man.""   ""How old are you ?"" Nately asked, growing intrigued and charmed with the old man in spite of himself.   
""A hundred and seven."" The old man chuckled heartily at Nately's look of chagrin. ""I see you don't believe that either.""   
""I don't believe anything you tell me,"" Nately replied, with a bashful mitigating smile. ""The only thing I do believe is that America is going to win the war.""   
""You put so much stock in winning wars,"" the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed. ""The real trick lies in losing wars, in knowing which wars can be lost, Italy has been losing wars for centuries, and just see how splendidly we've done nonetheless. France wins wars and is in a continual state of crisis. Germany loses and prospers. Look at our own recent history. Italy won a war in Ethiopia and promptly stumbled into serious trouble. Victory gave us such insane delusions of grandeur that we helped start a world war we hadn't a chance of winning. But now that we are losing again, everything has taken a turn for the better, and we will certainly come out on top again if we succeed in being defeated.""

I too lament the viewing habits of the disregarded masses. Given a choice, too many will watch Rupert Murdoch produced propaganda. As much as I might despise this fact, the rating are not in dispute. There is nothing for it.

In America, the government tried to bankroll a proper left-leaning news channel created by Al Gore and called ""Current"". It failed horror show as nobody watched. Recently, to avoid paying higher taxes, Gore sold his network at a huge profit to an oily government-controlled propaganda mill in the Middle East. This was just one example of many of the failure of the people to eat their boring news medicine if it isn't diluted with vacuous leggy blonds or bouncing, bare boobs.

Unlike down under, in America there is the a right to free speech. There is, however, no right to an audience. We can't force people to tune in to what is good for them. One of our most popular news shows for low information Americans is called the ""Daily Show"". The host acts as a sycophantic court jester and personal apologist for the Obama regime. Far too many young people confuse this tired toady's tirades as information. His fan base is as loyal as it is misinformed. Still, I wouldn't ban the sorry show if I could, though that would be a helpful step in this decaying, doomed democracy.

Most of the time we'd disconnect the electric meter itself (it was easier and quicker), but a lot of times it wouldn't be accessible from the street; it could be behind fences, behind doors or even behind the main entrance's locked door. We could also resort to street electrical boxes or the electric pole. We worked in groups of two and unfortunately for me, I was stuck with the damn boss. 

In order to do disconnects as quick as possible, meant we'd resort to shady methods since the electric meter was the quickest too. Sometimes that meant bump keys, old credit cards and even steel hand saw blades. I got astonished at how quickly a great amount of doors could be opened using those methods in seconds.

Our government is growing bigger every day and grabbing more control over more people's lives.  A huge percentage of our population depends on government welfare and are therefore slaves to the system.  We are now considered foolish if we have any expectation to privacy and anyone who tries to stand up and expose the depth of corruption are smeared as traitors.

"&gt;This has a lot of downvotes and not a single rebuttal or attempt to refute.

Ok, the post starts off by claiming study after study.  Unfortunately for him, the ""science"" of the post is based mainly off a ""research paper"" called ""Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability"".  It's by a man known as [J. Rushton] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Philippe_Rushton).  His work is very controversial and is considered racist by much of the psychology community.  He also headed the [Pioneer Fund] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Fund) which helps to fund the research, since it is also considered to be a white supremacist group and a hate group.

I could go into the cultural bias of IQ tests and the overall methodology of the study, but why would I do that when all he's done is make the claim that income level is the only factor of consequence when it comes to environmental factors and then quotes brain weight as the reason for the genetic IQ discrepancies.  

Oh, but wait, there's more.  Let's totally throw out the whole genetic theory, resort to crime statistics which have absolutely no correlation to genetics at all, and pull the theory that black people are naturally violent right out of our ass.  Crime statistics are higher for blacks, and they look bad, but they don't do anything with respect to supporting the supposed point of the post which is that blacks are genetically less intelligent.  No, he just hates black people, so lets tack it on to the end.  It's ok though, because black people are good at basketball...

 The whole post is dribble masquerading as science.  It uses a borderline racist paper that doesn't do enough to account for environmental factors to ""prove"" that blacks are genetically inferior.  Then it becomes unfocussed and loses the point completely.  It's crap.  If you're gonna be racist, you're gonna need to do better than that.

&gt; plus this is now on SRS and you are being downvote brigaded.

That it is, but you're gonna have a hard time posting racist IQ studies without getting downvotes no matter how many SRSers find out.

"&gt; TL;DR Violent Muslims does not make Islam today a violent religion.

What, in your view, does it take for a religion to be described as violent, then? I mean, for Islam we can check off the following, at least:

* Violent core texts.
* Extremely violent main prophet.
* Extremely violent, vengeful, jealous and petty God figure.
* Spread by the sword for centuries.
* Largest number of violent adherents of any religion in modern times.
* Violent adherents often consciously targets innocent civilians.
* Many adherents often reacts violently to slight perceived offences.
* Large share of adherents supports murdering apostates, and execution for other thought crimes, like blasphemy.
* Large share of adherents supports execution for victimless crimes, such as pre-marital sex.
* Causes massive amounts of pain and suffering for civilians through terrorism on an almost daily basis.
* Has violent conflicts with people of other faiths on almost every single border where there is a Muslim majority population on one side.

...and one could probably go on for quite a bit more.

This is not sufficient to describe a religion as violent?

&gt;* BANGALORE: A 32-year-old salesman Santosh Gowda with a shoe company committed suicide, citing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's alleged ""bad administration"" and failure to repel attacks by Pakistan as the cause.

&gt;* The suicide came to light when a neighbour peeped though the half-open door of his single-bedroom residence around 7.30pm Thursday.

&gt;* Santosh, a bachelor, was upset that he couldn't be a success in life.

&gt;* I am upset with prime minister Manmohan Singh for his failures... Pakistani soldiers are foraying into our territory, killing our Armymen and beheading them at will.

U.S. Furious With Israel After Sale of Advanced Military Technology to China

December 22, 2013 11:40 am

Author: Gidon Ben-zvi

The Israeli Defense Ministry’s Head of Defense Export Control, Meir Shalit, resigned last week after the United States expressed anger over a decision he made to sell sensitive military equipment to China, Israeli daily Ma’ariv reported on Sunday. At the time, Shalit did not provide a reason for his resignation.

Washington asserted that his authorization of the sale of a miniature cooling system for missiles was in direct violation of Israel’s preexisting obligations to the United States.

The conflict came as a result of differing interpretations of defense agreements between Israel and the U.S., according to the report. Israel claimed that the highly sensitive part was actually sold to a European company as part of a separate deal, but the Americans contended that the fact that it ultimately wound up in China is a breach of long-standing arrangements between Washington and Jerusalem.

Furthermore, there is fear among the Americans that this advanced technology has found its way from China to Iran.

About a month ago, according to Ma’ariv, American officials confronted Israel on the issue of how the part ended up in China. At this point, Shalit assumed full responsibility and said that he would resign. Over the past weekend while on a visit to the United States, Shalit personally apologized to American officials for authorizing the sale.

The cooling system is made by Ricor Systems, a worldwide leader in innovative cooler technology for the infrared, scientific instrumentation and semiconductor industries.

The past year has seen a significant boon in ties between Israel and China. The development of relations between the two countries was highlighted during a visit to Israel last week by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",2

Her position is largely untenable. Don't be dense for the sake of a point.

&gt;People are too sensitive these days and need to get a life and stop getting so mad over tiny, trivial shit.

Yeah, because people's views on entire ethnic and racial groups, or continents have never in the history of the world had negative consequences for those groups or continents. We should all just shut up because some random person on the internet isn't personally offended and feels that their personal in-offense should be the standard by which all others feel and react. How about you stop trying to tell people what they should or should not be sensitive to - and you get a life. Your anger towards what others find offensive is what's trivial and of absolutely no value. 

&gt;Yeah, she might be a racist, she might be a very stupid woman. But who cares!? She's just one person who said a stupid thing.

Seriously, you make pharmacist sound like glorified bag boys... but pharmacist are trained to administered drugs and understand anaphylaxis. The whole idea that someone would be held accountable for acting to the standard of care is asinine. There isn't a bunch of different ways to treat anaphylaxis in the field. There aren't contraindications when someone is anaphylaxis shock. There is **one** treatment and that treatment is epinephrine. 

In the US, I hear stories about pharmacist going beyond their scope of practice all the time. Reading EKGs, giving nitro, etc... and guess what... nothing happens. You have to be INCREDIBLY STUPID to be held accountable for medical neglect (like pretend you can read an EKG and miss ST elevation and tell the patient to go home). And this is why medical boards exist; there is this universal acknowledgement that you can't write strict laws dictating the protocols of medical professionals... especially in a field that is very dynamic. And thus the states/governments/etc have establish medical boards that look at the big picture. 

And this is why a medical student may ""get away"" with intubating someone in a life-threatening emergency where a real doctor doesn't. The medical student may be a EMT-B in a national disaster, but had training during one of his rotations. That medical doctor may be a dermatologist who decided to intubate someone and not call 911.

It is not a far stretch of the imagination that they already have many agents among us that are ready to strike strategic targets to create chaos within the civilian populace, scatter and divide our military operations, and laugh while we scramble around tripping over our own shoelaces like a Black Friday Shopping frenzy.

Either because the demand for it is too great, because they have too much pride (Japan has a lot of pride), or because that would mean an entire artificial industry they've kept going would disappear.

&gt;We have had confirmed cases this year of the tax records of political opponents under heavy scrutiny simply because they're political opponents. We've had journalists spied on by the government in an attempt to find their sources, going against the principles of freedom of the press. 

False, this is not going against free press. Clearly following journalists to find sources of criminals is part of law enforcement's job. It's up to the journalist to defend his source.

Yeah tax records of politicians is important. As well as medical records.

We want to know everything about a politician before we elect them. Because they make the nation's most important decisions.

&gt;secret courts, secret warrants, secret interpretations of the law, 

There's no such thing as secret interpretations of law, only secret decisions by a secret court. And secret courts are a response to the Nixon wiretaps, before courts could review NSA activity.

So basically, if you're against secret courts, you're a right-wing fascist who wants foreign intel to be only accessed by the President rather than both the President and judiciary.

&gt;If the government's actions are all legal, why are they the ones going to such great lengths to hide everything they do? 

Because in a representative democracy--you do not have a right to read everything on Obama's desk. You do not have an egotistical entitlement to know details of spying programs meant to capture terrorists.

&gt; That's an argument that stopped working when I was 4 and tried to say that it was Ok for me to do something because mommy lets my big brother do it. 

Why? It was a valid argument when you were 4 too. The only reason parents tell you this isn't a valid argument is because they don't want to deal with investigating who started what. They are more interested in ending it completely.

But this is irrational if you want to get to the root cause of any problem.

Islam has a small branch that are responsible for such actions, but it would be wrong to therefore categorize Islam as a religion of war. Also Islam is not the only religion with a concept of jihad. Watch the video. Islam promotes peace, only war when their faith is at stake. When one side wishes for peace they must stop. They also have ethics of war.

I find it interesting you think that anyone with common sense would see that Islam is evil when you are both ignorant and stupid. Also you're facts are completely wrong. Islam is the second largest religion in the world, it is also the fastest growing. As you can see you're the one who lacks the sense to see that Islam is a religion of peace.

Lastly, Muslims are not barbaric, nor do they follow a dead pedophile warlord. If you're referring to Muhammad (PBUH), it is a sin in Islam to worship anyone other than god.

"I don't really want to directly compare the founders and the no taxation without representation issue in the past, but if you changed a few things in that thought process I think you can find some commonality.

Let's look at the population estimates for England back in 1770 and America in 1770.

England: 6.4 million
America (colonies): 2,148,076

http://www.thepotteries.org/dates/census.htm

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_the_United_States

So what if they just go by popular rule there and say American votes don't count? Surely they have the majority. Surely they can just say that its fair because Americans had unpopular opinions and didn't deserve representation unless their opinions became more popular. However, that can definitely be called tyranny of the majority in some circumstances, and if you look at the founding history there was certainly some mention of avoiding this. They could have pretended to say they heard the American voices and just said they disagreed and majority rules, that's possibly how it could be described today. It pretty much is, its like yeah you got your 20% support but we don't care we won, better luck next time. Imagine if Americans did have a vote and England was like, yeah you got your 25% vote (they had roughly 25% of combined population) but you lost so we don't care cause we had 75% of the vote. Of course that's not how it would actually work I'm just trying to make a simple comparison that what you just said doesn't mean people are getting representation.

Of course many things in our system do have some affect on limiting tyranny of the majority, but its not good enough.",1
"Many religious texts, including the Bible, advocates violence quite extensively. However, in our modern society, most religious people have realised that maybe they shouldn't take *everything* literally.

Most, if not all, of the larger branches of the major religions in our world advocate peace, love and understanding (to various degrees), regardless of what their religious scripts say. 

That's the beauty of religious texts; they're *very* open to interpretation.

This is not to say that there aren't problems when it comes to things such as women's rights, sexual freedom and the like, but I find those issues to be on a separate level from murder and warfare. 

Disclaimer: of course there are groups who take their scriptures literally and advocate violence even today, but I argue that these factions represent a minority.

"&gt;We're discussing philosophy, not science.

And you're quiet the specimen of idiot for thinking there isn't a relationship between the two. philosophy and science are inseparable from each other, they define each other. Take note, only a complete *fool* would think that philosophy could exist in a vacuum outside of scientific measure. Niels Bohr, one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century, often considered himself a philosopher and a mystic, and consulted scientific principles frequently when drafting his philosophic doctrine.

*Cue disgruntled spitting of tobacco.* Seriously, Who the fuck do you think you are, Davy Crockett?

What does one thing have to do with the other? Just because a grizzly can kill me does not mean it has any sort of principle of ownership above or below me. Violence does not assert values, violence is only violence, it does not create a legitimate hierarchy. I could take a gun right now and walk into a gas station and shoot the attendant at the counter, does that mean I am now the new sovereign and rightful owner of Turkey Hill? Or am I simply a homicidal maniac with an inferiority complex?

""Might makes right"" is a statement of pure ignorance, it shows that you are not capable of understanding, rationalizing, or approaching difficult issues without resorting aggression. You are the sort of person who, since the dawn of mankind, has created war, strife, poverty, and bloodshed because instead of dealing with issues using the faculty of your mind you turn to your inebriated capacity for violence as a means of creating your own morality.

Using the previous numbers, and assuming 1/4th of your salary will go towards mortgage, then a reasonable housing price for the average American is about $200k.

"1.   Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the 'How dare you!' gambit.

2.   Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.

3.  Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.

4.  Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.

5. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can 'argue' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues.

6.  Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.'",1

Legalizing it is just going to legalize it, not make people do it, you will have exactly the same situation we see today. Do you see rich guys openly dating many women today? Just because it's legal doesn't make women want it. And the truth is the rich men are smart, they don't want the liability that many women can bring them (children are expensive). Simply put income differences don't matter today, because divorce is legal, and it hurts the richer partner significantly. It means not only do men not what to marry many women, but women don't want other women to suck from the familys wealth.

It was/is a problem is poorer areas because women could essentially be bought against their will, but with divorce being legal, it's actually more of the oppisite today, you are trusting your partner with your wealth, attempting to buy a poor woman just opens the door for them to take half your money.

If you make polygamy legal it's going to do the same thing legalizing gay marriage does today. The gay people today live together, but they can't visit their partner in the ER, similarily polygamist live together today, but again, they can't visit each other in the ER, because they can't get technically married, only two of them can be technically married, with the rest technically dating, with makes the marriage unfair and uneven, even though that's probably not wanted.

Anyways, this is the main reason I am today against gay marriage as we see it today, gov shouldn't get involved in marriage, and should open up the laws to leave marriage totally undefined, in such a way that gay marriage and polygamy is legal, unfortunally the changes needed to do that are impossible in todays political climate, so I approve of the current efforts to legalize gay marriage as a stopgap measure.",15

Iceland benefited from the Marshall Plan as well, so we owe our thanks to the Americans for that.

"Muslims don't 'worship' Mohammad, since he is not regarded as being deified in the same way as Jesus is thought of as literally 'the son of God'.

Plenty of historical figures that are well regarded today married/slept with people who would be considered children nowadays.

To get a bit more modern, in a time when it *wasn't* culturally acceptable, read up on Gandhi and his night time habits.

Nobody follows Islam because Mohammed married children, just as nobody cites Plato or Gandhi as great historical figures because they slept with children.

Also, Christianity and Islam are two massive reasons we live in a modern, (mostly) educated world today. Being almost the sole source of education in Europe during the Middle Ages, Christian churches and monasteries preserved and researched a massive amount of information about history, science and classical literature that wouldn't have existed otherwise. And during this time, science in the Islamic world far outreached anything that backwater dark age Europe could hope for; mathematics, physics and astronomy all flourished in the Middle East while Europe was still reeling from the collapse of the Roman Empire.

"What an insanely stupid assertion. No serious historian would assert that the kulaks as a class were fictional propaganda- after the Stolypin reforms in 1905, a class of wealthy peasants that hired farm labor was created. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak#Definitions

&gt;The Stolypin reform created a new class of landowners by allowing peasants to acquire plots of land for credit from the large estate owners. They were to repay the credit (a kind of mortgage loan) from their farm work. By 1912, 16% of peasants (up from 11% in 1903) had relatively large endowments of over 8 acres (3.2 ha) per male family member (a threshold used in statistics to distinguish between middle-class and prosperous farmers, i.e., kulaks). At that time an average farmer's family had 6 to 10 children. The number of such farmers amounted to 20% of all rural courts, while their production level was reaching 50% of marketable grain.[7]

&gt;In May 1929, the Sovnarkom issued a decree that formalised the notion of ""kulak household"" (кулацкое хозяйство). Any of the following defined a kulak:[3][12]

&gt;use of hired labor
&gt;ownership of a mill, a creamery (маслобойня, butter-making rig), &gt;other processing equipment, or a complex machine with a mechanical motor
&gt;systematic renting out of agricultural equipment or facilities

The problems I see here:
1) this guy was running out of money and this finding got him back in business. He may have faked results out of desparation.
2) He is using what sounds like, undiferentatied stem cells. They dont have the same bonding sites for viruses. Maybe they are modified to do that, but its not the same and you wont know if it will work the same.
3) getting the (cure) DNA into every cell of your body. If they perfect this then there are a shit ton more disease we can cure. But you don't hear of anyone doing it. + if he is using a virus to infect T cells (with the cure), I would guess the process will still kill the T cells.

"&gt; The idea of Zionism was to create a country with special preferences for Jews, like Israel has today.

You are wrong. The idea of Zionism doesn't say anything about special privileges, and there are no special privileges for Jews in Israel currently.

&gt; It was not certain that Jews would be a majority in Israel, which is precisely why mass expulsions if Muslims in 1947-48 were necessary.

It was certain Jews would be a majority in the long run, but in 1948 there was a civil war. The expulsion happened as part of a genocidal war who's explicit objective was to drive out the Jews. Even then the expulsion only happened to the Muslim communities who aided Israel's enemies, and most fled after hearing Arab state propaganda.

&gt; Beyond that, ethnic groups do not have a right to a state.

Are you also against Tibetan independence, and against a Kurdish state?

&gt; To claim that a movement claiming to represent an ethnic group can choose a region they feel some connection with, and then proceed to expel enough of the local population in order to create a majority, it grotesque.

Nobody claims that. Nice strawman.

&gt; To the extent that Germany or France would give any preference to ethnic Germans or Frenchmen

Germany and France are both ethnic countries, and they give special privileges to German and French citizens.

"I agree religion is backwards. I am a staunch atheist. My point is that if you call Jordan backwards then you can call USA backwards.

Here is what wikipedia says about Law in Jordan: Sharia law only applies to Muslims. 

&gt;The Jordanian legal system is derived from the Napoleonic code (inherited from the Ottoman and Egyptian legal systems) and Sharia. It has also been influenced by tribal traditions.[48]

&gt;The highest court is the Court of Cassation, followed by the Courts of Appeal.[48] The lower courts are divided into civil courts and sharia courts. Civil courts have jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases, while the sharia courts have jurisdiction over personal status for Muslims, including marriage, divorce, and inheritance; parallel tribunals handle such matters for non-Muslims.[48] Shari’a courts also have jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the Islamic waqfs. In cases involving parties of different religions, regular courts have jurisdiction.[49]

&gt;The Constitution of Jordan was adopted on January 11, 1952 and has been amended many times. Article 97 of Jordan's constitution guarantees the independence of the judicial branch, clearly stating that judges are 'subject to no authority but that of the law.' While the king must approve the appointment and dismissal of judges, in practice these are supervised by the Higher Judicial Council. Article 99 of the Constitution divides the courts into three categories: civil, religious and special. The civil courts deal with civil and criminal matters in accordance with the law, and they have jurisdiction over all persons in all matters, civil and criminal, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts and the Supreme Court.

&gt;The Family Law in force is the Personal Status Law of 1976.[50] Sharia Courts have jurisdiction over personal status matters relating to Muslims.[51]

&gt;Jordan's law enforcement ranked 24th in the world, 4th in the Middle East, in terms of police services' reliability in the Global Competitiveness Report. Jordan also ranked 13th in the world and 3rd in the Middle East in terms of prevention of organized crime, making it one of the safest countries in the world.[52]",0

"Decay Heat from a typical LWR can be found with the following formula:

         Po = the original power output of the reactor;

"Right, you've done a great job of explaining why fixing the food shortage is nearly impossible *within capitalism*. There are a million diverse self-interested people and groups who are all affected by what happens in different ways. Your bit about factoring in ""who"" does everything gets at this: Obviously, these people have certain incentives, because they receive pay (and livelihood) based on what they do. 

A better system would be one that acknowledges collectively when we need to do certain things to accomplish certain large-scale goals (such as making sure everybody has food). Then we look at the problems you addressed, and figure out how to fix them. Let's say it requires closing down a fertilizer plant. Well we can't just shut that fucker down, we need to make sure that every employee there can still get all of life's necessities and take on meaningful work. Capitalism doesn't take this collective, long-term approach to problem solving, which is why it is awful at solving collective, long-term problems. 

This is also the problem with capitalism: It is the allocation system that creates these problems, and offers very little in solving them. You're basically acknowledging that capitalism cannot get everybody food. Well then, frankly, it's a bad fucking system. Capitalism requires ever-increasing military force: bad system. Capitalism has created more empty houses than their are homeless people: Stupid fucking system. 

What would a better system be? One that tackles problems instead of perpetuates them. One that dashes the fiction that we are selfish, greedy individuals who only act on our short-term self-interest.

[Muslim women not used to drinking walk free after attack on woman](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8937856/Muslim-women-not-used-to-drinking-walk-free-after-attack-on-woman.html)

&gt;A gang of Somalian women who repeatedly kicked a young woman in the head walked free from court after a judge heard they were ""not used to being drunk"" because they were Muslim.

&gt;The four women - three sisters and their cousin - were told the charge of actual bodily harm, which carries a maximum sentence of five years, against 22-year-old care worker Rhea Page would normally land them in custody.

&gt;However, the judge handed the women suspended sentences after hearing that they were not used to alcohol because their religion does not allow it.

&gt;Miss Page said Ambaro Maxamed, 24, Ayan Maxamed, 28, and Hibo Maxamed, 24, and their 28-year-old cousin Ifrah Nur screamed ""Kill the white slag"" while kicking her in the head as she lay motionless on the ground.

&gt;The support worker from Leicester was left ""black and blue"" with bruises and needed hospital treatment following the attack which came as she walked to a taxi rank with her boyfriend.

&gt;Miss Page was left so traumatised by the attack that she lost her job due to repeated absences with stress and flashbacks.

&gt;She had been walking home with her boyfriend after a night out when the drunken women attacked her, knocking her to the ground and taking turns to kick her in the head.

[Female Gang Who Attacked Woman Spared Jail As They Were 'Not Used To Alcohol'](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/12/07/female-gang-who-attacked-woman-spared-jail_n_1133734.html)

&gt;A female gang who shouted “kill the white slag” while attacking a woman in Leicester city centre have been spared jail after a judge heard that the Muslim girls were not used to drinking alcohol.

&gt;Rhea Page was set upon while walking to a taxi rank with her boyfriend in June last year. The attackers dragged the victim to the ground by her hair then beat her with kicks and punches.

&gt;Page’s boyfriend, 23-year-old Lewis Moore, was also attacked as he tried to fend off the four women.

&gt;Sisters Ambaro Maxamed, 24, Ayan Maxamed, 28, and Hibo Maxamed, 24, along with their cousin Ifrah Nur, 28, were convicted of causing actual bodily harm.

&gt;During the trial the court heard that Ambaro Maxamed called Page a ""white bitch"" then pulled the hair, forcing her to the floor.

&gt;The judge decided that the attack was not racially motivated.

&gt;The attackers faced up to five years in jail, but Judge Robert Brown delivered six-month suspended sentences after hearing mitigation that the women are not use to drinking alcohol due to their religion.

&gt;During the trial, the defense for Ambaro Maxamed said: “They’re Somalian Muslims and alcohol or drugs isn’t something they’re used to.”

&gt;The 22-year-old victim, who suffered stress and lost her job after to the attack, described the sentence as “disgusting”.

&gt;After the trial, Page said: “They were taking turns to kick me in the head and back over and over. I thought they were going to kill me. I honestly think they attacked me just because I was white. I can’t think of any other reason.”

"Surprise, paper gold (traded on exchanges and the asset in question) is a commonly held item by forex traders, either long or short. It's a very small market relative to the actual physical market and frequently traded on maximum margins.

**There is absolutely zero physical gold supply/demand data points which have caused this downswing. There is no large drying of demand for physical gold which has caused this market swing.**

This large drop is highly unlikely the result of a panic per se in relation to the gold market. What we're seeing is, from my view, an unwinding of long gold positions to pay for other bad bets in forex and other asset markets.

If I'm correct, Friday's drop is exacerbated by margin calls in previously strong gold positions. Traders are being forced to divest some degree of their position to cover margin hikes (Shanghai hiked today) and margin calls.

This doesn't appear to be a loss of confidence in gold as a store of value, nor as a disfavoring of its use as a hedge against inflation. It really appears to be a short term drop related to the nature of modern trading strategies. A swing of a certain size will, because of margin trading, guarantee an even larger swing in that direction as once profitable bets have to be unwound to deal with margin hikes and calls.

But of course, a decade of steady gains directly related to loose monetary policy is a bubble despite never entering a mania phase, let alone going parabolic, and this is obviously the popping of that bubble.

They distributed gasmasks to their troops. Then they fired rockets from a regime-controlled area into 11 neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of opposition forces. Shortly after those rockets landed, the gas spread, and hospitals filled with the dying and the wounded. We know senior figures in Assad’s military machine reviewed the results of the attack, and the regime increased their shelling of the same neighborhoods in the days that followed. We’ve also studied samples of blood and hair from people at the site that tested positive for sarin.""

"&gt;Only if you assume that the imperatives that guided the US in the 80's are still dominant today.

That *is* the implicit assumption. Presidents come and go, US foreign policy remains, to a greater or lesser extent, steadfast in its roots laid down by George Kennan after WWII. We see this in his famous, now declassified, memo [PPS23](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Memo_PPS23_by_George_Kennan) where he talks of maintaining global wealth discrepancy in the interests of the US.

&gt;[Furthermore, we have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3% of its population. This disparity is particularly great as between ourselves and the peoples of Asia. In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security.](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Memo_PPS23_by_George_Kennan)

In this document, he outlines a *universal* and a *particular* approach to foreign policy, which is a fancy way of saying the former is working within international legal frameworks, whilst the latter amounts to ignoring them. He then proceeds to outline that the United States is ""is now conducting a dual policy, which combines elements of both of these approaches"" which, is simply another fancy way of saying - we'll work within international frameworks when it suits our interests, and ignore them when it doesn't. We see this playing out over decades in [Libya](http://www.globalresearch.ca/everything-that-nato-has-done-in-libya-has-been-illegal/26382), Iraq, Nicaragua, Vietnam - all the way back to Iran and Guatemala in 1953. There is a consistent pattern of continuity, regardless of the president at the helm.

Analysing US foreign policy from an historical perspective, there's no reason to judge Obama as different from past presidents like Bush and Reagan. If we had a Gandhi on our hands, I'd agree with you - but it's quite clear that we don't. Obama is carrying on Kennan's implicit policy of a *dual approach* to maintain the requisite geopolitical disparity necessary to keep the US in its position as top dog. The policy is hypocritical in light of the past; the person is, in my humble opinion, relatively insignificant.

A large portion of the upper class's wealth is stored in bank accounts and as I stated above does not change hands for decades.

Taxing the lower and middle classes who do spend pretty much all of their money can be called into question for its need. So that I give you.

&gt; every welfare State in history has crashed and burned hard, and this is also overlooking the fact that Europe is in deep shit whether the common man realizes it or not

Please just go look at norway and denmark. They have some of the highest taxation in the world (Exceeding 70% on some working class) While also managing to be some of the states that have the highest standard of living. They are also no where near crashing or burning. Ironically. Even the Soviet Union in the 30's shrugged the great depression off like it was nothing. Welfare states are much more resiliant to economic trouble. Spain was pretty far from a welfare state. Greece collapsed mostly because over 15% of the population was employed as bureaucrats.

Finally. Before you attempt to attack me as being a communist or soviet union supporter. No I am not. I am merely using a historic example of a welfare state working well.

"&gt; cult of personality that has been built around the figure of the Pope...is not entirely healthy

I completely agree with you there. I am a former Catholic myself, and I attended Catholic school for 8 years of my education. I remember the photos of John Paul II on the walls of the classrooms, right next to the photos of the president. In some way, I feel that the cult of personality keeps the Pope held as an authority figure, someone that Catholics should admire, respect and obey- just like the cult of personality that follows US Presidents and other world political figureheads. I think the result is both positive and negative: positive in the sense that it gives the pope authority, but negative because that tends to encourage followers to sort of hit the 'subscribe all' button on beliefs, instead of encouraging them to use the doctrine as a framework around which to build their own belief system.

I guess saying that he is considered ""more-than-human"" probably isn't too much of a stretch. Speaking from my own experiences with Catholic friends and family members, I know quite a few that do view the Pope as someone who maybe isn't more-than-human, but is *certainly* more holy and deserving of heaven than anyone else. I think that could be something Pope Francis is trying to undo. He seems to be dressing more modestly and acting more humbly than, say, Pope Benedict, something I truly appreciate. It won't bring me back to the Church, but I am starting to have hope that the Church will begin to update itself a bit.",1

Yea I get that it's happened a lot before in human history. Duh. But what about the prevalence of attacks in countries with strict ""moral codes"".  This question was phrased in a way to make you question the frequency of horrific and barbaric attacks.  And it worked for you.

Corporations are not pretending to have any sort of moral highground. This does not excuse their actions, and they are the worst of the worst in so far as human rights violations, murder, and environmental destruction.  Hands down.

But how can any group of people who consider themselves morally well founded treat human beings so terribly?  Whether it's the christians in the dirty south persecuting homosexuals, Muslims persecuting women, or any group of faith persecuting anyone.

Countries with stricter gun laws and more murders isn't an argument because how many more murders would there be with guns? It's the issue of high crime rate they need to deal with and eliminating guns removes that from the equation.

Guns don't cause murders, but the people with access to guns find it a lot easier to kill someone if they have a motive and an efficient way of doing so. 

I understand the American right to bare arms and protect themselves. But protect yourself from what? Other people with guns? Isn't that counter productive?

"&gt; First of all the missiles range while its technically 700km they would be firing blind since no ship to ship based radar has anywhere near that range. 

Not like Russia has satellites or something.

&gt;This means ECM and decoys are more effective.

If they know it's coming, which is the main point of such a long range and high speed

&gt;Also even at mach 2.5 that's around 800 seconds of travel time which gives the carrier strike group which normally has 2 missile cruisers and 2 destroyers a decent amount of time to activate their defenses and then counter the missiles.

**If** they know it was launched.

&gt; Not to mention the combat air patrol in continuous patrol over the carriers.

So?

&gt;The Russians never really planned for 1 cruiser to penetrate a carrier group by itself they were always fans of combined arms or larger masses.

Actually, they did. Their plans never involved fighting carrier battle groups one on one. It was always about not allowing them to operate at all. Single Slava class carries 16 missiles exactly for this purpose, to launch either one or two salvos at a carrier. Off course, in case of war they also had submarines armed with similar missiles and planes. Combining all that means they could overwhelm carrier defence and sink it. 

&gt;Now if the Russians snuck closer then launched from much closer it becomes quite dicey to stop all the missiles.

If only they had submarines. Something like Kilo class or ....

Oh geeeee .... a sub popped up in **torpedo** range of the US carrier.

"&gt; I understand but I feel like an animal raised with a easy going life and a quick death beats being eaten alive by a predator. 

Nature is harsh. No arguments there. But nature can also be lovely. Most wild animals do have some joy and love and excitement in their lives. There are usually harsh times too, but I'd choose to be a wild deer over a farmed pig any day.

Even the better ""humane"" farms generally don't rise to that standard. Common practices include surgery without anesthetic, being killed young (animals raised as food are eaten as juveniles), generally cramped conditions (even on the more spacious farms), etc.

What's more -- even if you found a farm that rose to your standard -- try as a thought experiment applying that logic to species that you personally care about. How would you feel if I raised puppies lovingly and then killed and ate them before they reached a year old and replaced them with more puppies? How would you feel about me having a child to kill before a year old?

&gt; but I don't see the world giving up such a rich source of amino acids and other nutrients. 

Except animals create **0** amino acids. All the aminos and proteins in a cow came from plants the cow ate. 

In fact, often from plants humans could have eaten. The figure varies by species, but we get something like 1/10th the protein we put into the animal back. It all gets literally pissed out. And since vegan diets are [supported by the ADA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864) and basically all mainstream health organizations, it makes sense to consider it.

But I agree, I don't see veganism becoming the norm soon. 

&gt; I wish vegetarians/vegans would set up donations to the scientists working on lab meat as I will make that switch as soon as it's a viable solution. 

A lot of that money comes from vegan interest groups actually. In any case, lab meat is sexy but there are viable options available now which aren't all that bad. (Ok, some of them are really that bad, but some are not!) There are, in fact, much better options than there has any reason to be since vegans are so rare. As vegan demand increases slowly, vegan products are getting better at a really astounding rate.

Most of these studies on both sides of the issue selectively ignore costs and benefits associated with manipulating the size and nature of the labor pool through immigration.  For other costs, see e.g., [1](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/16/collecting-billions-in-a-loophole-fraudulent-tax-r/), or [2](http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/22674743/irs-sent-46-million-in-tax-refunds-to-an-atlanta-address).  There are also costs that have yet to be measured, but that have been described and studied quantitatively by esteemed social scientists like (the extremely liberal) Robert Putnam, who discovered that an increase in diversity effected a reduction in trust and social capital.

As for employment, illegal and legal immigration are both disastrous, especially during periods of high unemployment in locations where wealth is stratified between a small elite and a large laboring population.  In addition to serving the function of driving wages down (yes, the law of supply and demand applies to labor), immigrants have a tendency to reduce the bargaining power of organized labor.  You can post all of the Center for American Progress studies that avoid calculating the costs imposed by immigrants and instead only look at the meager wealth they generate as substitute labor, but they won't change the fact that the law of supply and demand applies to labor.

Poaching will be a problem that we will have to face this century, but I believe through providing alternate jobs, increasing the standard of living, both of which are already dramatically happening across India, this problem will slowly, but surely solve its self, killing people is not going to solve the long-term problem here.",1

"The government was more or less laissez-faire prior to the Great Depression. Not 100% hands off, but laissez-faire was the accepted model at the time. I wasn't saying the Great Depression had to do with capitalism, simply that the the market did not self-correct like proponents of the laissez-faire approach had thought. The reason the market did not self-correct is because people weren't spending. Since people weren't spending, more and more people lost work and it became a cycle. It became evident, after that, that some amount of government intervention was necessary in order to avoid the disastrous conditions that followed the Great Depression. 

The recession that started back in 2008 is a good example to look at. The reason we weren't impacted as much as we were in the Great Depression was largely in part because the government made sure people had money in their pockets and were spending. The government also invested in infrastructure to give more people jobs, even if they're temporary. Instead of letting the auto industry and banks fold (which would have affected far more than just those two industries), we propped them up with bailouts. They may not have fixed everything, but I guarantee you doing nothing would have been far worse. ",1

Funny, you claim not to be a Tory yet you seem to be getting the lion’s share of your propaganda from their hymn sheet or the right wing press. 
In re your regurgitation of the Labour/deficit myth debate, have a read of this. 

http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ramesh-patel/growth-cameron-austerity_b_2007552.html

It’s written by Ramesh Patel, a Tory and an economist, I felt it would be an ideal piece of source to use in this situation as you may listen to one of your fellows.

&gt;Textbook. Straight out of the mouth of some Labour wonk.

Can’t you do better than that? I’ve already told you that I’m not a Labour supporter. I’ve never voted for them and don’t intend to.
It’s plain to see that the Tory party works for the rich of the country. If you can’t see that then you need to scrape the ballbags out of your eyes and pick up some unbiased media every now and then. Since the Tories gained power they’ve set about their usual agenda of turning the working classes against each other to distract them while they systematically shut down nationalised services and divvy up public facilities to engorge their already capacious bank balances.

&gt;The NHS has had private involvement for years, well back into the Labour era. No evidence to suggest that the key element of the NHS - free care at point of use - will change, but it doesn't stop the Labourites crowing on about it as if it is the end of the NHS or universal healthcare. Very little has changed around here - all of the GPs/hospitals are in the same ownership as they were before that bill passed, and it's still free to use.

What absolute horseshit.

Any ‘private involvement’ was the work of the last Tory government, who began to take the institution to pieces before being stopped in their tracks by losing the general election. Even Oliver Letwin noted back in 2004 that the ""NHS will not exist"" within five years of a Conservative election victory and lo and behold, what do we have when ol’ Dave and his mates get back in power? A series of sweeping ‘reforms’ which basically herald the end of the institution.

Oh, and let’s take a look at how many of his cabinet have interests in private healthcare concerns – 

http://socialinvestigations.blogspot.co.uk/p/mps-with-or-had-financial-links-to.html

Quite a few, eh? Or do you still think they’re decent old school types who want the best for the people?

&gt;I think this sentence alone speaks volumes. Perhaps you should seek mental assistance? Assuming of course under the evil Conservatives we actually offer that to people.”

Ad hominem horseshit. 

Cameron has the blood of many on his hands. He deserves no respect or quarter. I wish him ill. For the sake of balance though, so that you don’t get all hot under your little Tory cut-away collar, I wish Tony Blair ill too, for similar reasons.

"All blood is screened, yes. But basically all tests have a window period after you're exposed to infection before they turn positive. This window is getting shorter, but it still exists. In addition, tests can be wrong. The scenario where someone is infected is nevertheless highly unlikely but is a real problem of you consider the amount of blood transfused yearly worldwide.

The other problem is unrecognized infections that we don't test for. AIDS is a new disease, imagine which group a new AIDS-like disease would infect first. Should that group be your first choice when you're looking for donors?",10

Their upper hand is numbers on paper, militarily. However any attack in which they are the aggressor will forego Chinese protection. 

Their true upper hand is in trying to provoke a preemptive strike and get China in on any conflict. The Americans will not do this but this seems to be what North Korea is trying for.

Given that it will not succeed it seems likely they will just keep up their prattle and we'll keep up a show of force. Again, it very unlikely there will be any follow-through on this.

The seeds were on his land. He did not put them there. Regardless of what he did after they were there, I am saying it was Monsanto's fault that he had them at all. Let's be honest - If every time these crops end up on a farmer's land, the farmer is going to lose out by having to have them removed and then replanting crops. Monsanto is technically infecting good crops and hurting the farmers if they do not allow the farmers to keep those crops.  
  
I'm also not sure what you said about free removal is true. At least it didn't appear to be in Percy's case without the payment of removal costs acting as a gag payment.

"I'm sorry but that's not really correct. I agree, as your link says, that there was no ""collective action by Jews"" until Modern Zionism, yet that in no way renders my earlier statement false. Throughout their 2,000 years in the diaspora, ever since the time of their exile under Roman rule, Jews have tried with varying degrees of success to return to their homeland.

I gave you an important example regarding Conversos in my comment above, and have provided more below (wiki)-

1. &gt;**In the 10th century**, leaders of the Karaite Jewish community, mostly living under Persian rule, urged their followers to settle in Eretz Yisrael. The Karaites established their own quarter in Jerusalem, on the western slope of the Kidron Valley. During this period, there is abundant evidence of pilgrimages to Jerusalem by Jews from various countries, mainly in the month of Tishrei, around the time of the Sukkot holiday.

2. &gt;The number of Jews migrating to the Land of Israel rose significantly between the **13th and 19th centuries**, mainly due to a general decline in the status of Jews across Europe and an increase in religious persecution. The expulsion of Jews from England (1290), France (1391), Austria (1421) and Spain (the Alhambra decree of 1492) were seen by many as a sign of approaching redemption and contributed greatly to the messianic spirit of the time.

3. &gt;Aliyah was also spurred during this period by the resurgence of messianic fervor among the Jews of France, Italy, the Germanic states, Poland, Russia and North Africa. The belief in the imminent coming of the Jewish Messiah, the ingathering of the exiles and the re-establishment of the kingdom of Israel encouraged many who had few other options to make the perilous journey to the Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael).

4. &gt;Pre-Zionist resettlement in Palestine met with various degrees of success. For example, little is known of the fate of the 1210 ""aliyah of the three hundred rabbis"" and their descendants. It is thought that few survived the bloody upheavals caused by the Crusader invasion in 1229 and their subsequent expulsion by the Muslims in 1291. After the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 and the expulsion of Jews from Spain (1492) and Portugal (1498), many Jews made their way to the Holy Land. Then the immigration in the 18th and early 19th centuries of thousands of followers of various Kabbalist and Hassidic rabbis, as well as the disciples of the Vilna Gaon and the disciples of the Chattam Sofer, added considerably to the Jewish populations in Jerusalem, Tiberias, Hebron, and Safed.

5. &gt;The messianic dreams of the Gaon of Vilna inspired one of the largest pre-Zionist waves of immigration to Eretz Yisrael. In **1808**, hundreds of the Gaon's disciples, known as Perushim, settled in Tiberias and Safed, and later formed the core of the Old Yishuv in Jerusalem. This was part of a larger movement of thousands of Jews from countries as widely spaced as Persia and Morocco, Yemen and Russia, who moved to Israel beginning in the first decade of the nineteenth century – and in even larger numbers after the conquest of the region by Muhammad Ali of Egypt in 1832 – all drawn by the expectation of the arrival of the Messiah in the Jewish year 5600, Christian year 1840, a movement documented in Arie Morgenstern's Hastening Redemption.

[A timeline chronicling Jewish immigration from the 18th-19th century](http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Jewish+History/Zionist+History).

Another relevant link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Yishuv#History

1. &gt;In 1492 and again in 1498, when the Sephardic Jews were expelled from Spain and Portugal respectively, some took it as a call from heaven to migrate to Palestine.[citation needed] Don Joseph Nasi succeeded in resettling Tiberias and Safed in 1561 with Sephardic Jews, many of them former Marranos. By the late 16th century,[citation needed] Safed had become a center of Kabbalah, inhabited by important rabbis and scholars. Among them were Rabbi Yakov bi Rav, Rabbi Moshe Cordevero, Rabbi Yosef Karo, and the Arizal. At this time there was a small community in Jerusalem headed by Rabbi Levi ibn Haviv also known as the Mahralbach. Rabbi Yeshaye Horowitz, the Shelah Hakadosh, arrived in 1620.

2. &gt;In 1700, a group of over 1,500 Ashkenazi Jews performed aliyah and settled in Jerusalem.[9] At that time, the Jewish population of the Old City was primarily Sephardi: 200 Ashkenazi Jews versus a Sephardi community of 1,000. These Ashkenazi immigrants heeded the call of Rabbi Yehuda he-Hasid, a Maggid of Shedlitz, Poland who went from town to town advocating a return to Eretz Yisrael to redeem its soil.

3. &gt;In the 18th century, groups of Hasidim and Perushim settled in Eretz Yisrael. In 1764 Rabbi Nachman of Horodenka, a disciple and mechutan of the Baal Shem Tov settled in Tiberias. According to ""Aliyos to Eretz Yisrael,"" he was already in Eretz Yisrael in 1750.

4. &gt;In 1777, the Hasidic leaders Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk and Rabbi Avraham of Kaliski, disciples of the Maggid of Mezeritch settled there. Mitnagdim began arriving in 1780. Most of them settled in Safed or Tiberias, but a few established an Ashkenazi Jewish community in Jerusalem, rebuilding the ruins of the Hurvat Yehudah He-Hasid (the destroyed synagogue of Judah He-Hasid).

5. &gt;Starting in 1830, about twenty disciples of the Chasam Sofer settled in Eretz Yisrael; almost all of them in Jerusalem.

There' also info there about immigration under Ibrahim Pasha's and Ottoman rule.

Like I previously said, there had been various attempts throughout the centuries to come back and resettle in Israel. None of them were as large or as successful as the modern Zionist movement (obviously), but Jews have *long* maintained a connection to their homeland not simply through scripture and tradition, but also through resettlement.",4

The reality is that religions are bodies of ideas, whose dependence on every last word in their textual tradition has **always** been questionable.

Religion-in-practice has always made choices about what it focuses on, and even what it outright ignores in their writ.

Anyway, Islam it's not a ""massive, massive problem."" Have you been to Iran or the Middle East? Most Muslims are nice, normal people who get along with everyone just fine. Seriously, I think you should visit Iran. Yes the government is totalitarian and scumbags, but the vast majority of people are brilliant and I felt much safer in Teheran than I ever have walking the streets of London.

Yes, Islam presents a different ideology to those of us who are not religious. Yes you and me think our system is better.

"&gt;  You seem to ignore the fact that within the first week of Israel's claim of independence they were attacked from all sides.

Yes, because they showed up in a land already occupied by native Arabs and other Levantine peoples and put their claim on a territory that the Arabs expected to call their own after the colonialist Brits left. Jews were seen as yet another European colonising force, but even more despicable because antisemitism was indeed a factor. 

So what do you propose? Ethnic cleansing? Yeap, that would solve the problem alright. Problem is that once the Jews made the decision to forcefully settle Palestine, they knew they were in for a fight. They got a fight. They can't complain about the fact that they got a fight.

"The Irgun believed in Revisionist Zionism and they claimed both sides of the Jordan river as part of Israel.  Revisionist Zionism started in in 1925 and after the Israeli war of Independence they were folded into the Herut and later Likud party even though many of the Revisionists, including Menachim Begin opposed the 1949  armistice that deprived Israel of lands east of the Jordan river.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/Revisionist_Zionism.html

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herut

So, no, they did not did not abandon their claims to present day Jordan and even the future 6th Prime Minister of Israel opposed the armistice that denied them those lands.  **After Israeli Independence** Menachim Begin still refused to recognize the legitimacy of Jordan and claimed that land as Israeli.

So the evidence is clear that the Jews were there to take as much land as they could and they would have if they had been unopposed.

"&gt;God's will with their desires, it's obvious that democracy just won't work alongside a strict or substantial Islamic interpretation.

I don't think it's that law and government are fundamentally different in democratizing parts of the middle east than they were when Western states were democratizing, and I'm not sure it's fair to compare the extent to which ""popular legitimacy"" is regarded in the West to how it's regarded in a post-dictatorship middle eastern (ME) country.

The problem isn't with populations in the ME being completely incompatible with democracy, it's that democratizations in the ME face a unique secular/religious tension.  In the West, secular/religious tension occurs in politics but is more about how policy should follow morals set up by religious institutions, but no one argues that law as a procedure should follow religious doctrine.  As you've pointed out, in the ME this tension manifests in the fundamental nature of law--should it be secular, or should religious law be adopted?  The secular/religious tension that the ME faces is certainly not new in our history, and is just another complication among the many that young democracies face.   

Israel is widely considered a democracy but constantly faces this problem.  There is a sizeable portion of Israeli's who think the Halakha should be the law of the land, yet they continue to have governments which are appointed through stable elections.  Turkey had similar problems many times throughout history. Clearly this secular/religious tension doesn't negate the prospects for successful democratization.  If you want to argue that Islam creates a lack of ""civil society,"" and as a result Muslims are uninterested in democratic representation then that's one argument (and I believe a very incorrect one), but saying that the secular/religious tension precludes democracy is the wrong way of looking at the problem.

Islam has a history with democracy. The first Caliphs were elected, and the region has had democratically elected governments, some of which only ceased to exist with help of our CIA.  I can see how Mr. Blair would find it politically fashionable to say Islam is incompatible with liberal governance, but he's wrong.  What we have is a tension between parts of society who differ on what they believe the law should look like, and that has happened in literally every democratization. 

So, I agree with your professor to a certain extent, but not that the law is *necessarily* different.  Rather, the debates surrounding secular/religious tensions are quite diverse and vary in the extent of their intensity.  That doesn't mean that in a country of predominantly Muslim citizens, the majority wants religious law over secular law.",1

I'm sure Chinese intelligence is pretty good at decryption. 

&gt;Thus, the only way China got anything from him would be if he was complicit. If China forced information out of him (unlikely), I doubt he'd stay quiet about that. Nor would he be entirely culpable.

I'm inclined to believe he sold it, actually. But this is all just speculation, of course. He travels directly to enemy nations with active intelligence wars with us with tons of sensitive data, freely sharing information on our foreign operations, and then travels on freely unscathed after disappearing from view for days at a time.

And since they're referenced within it, here's the text of Articles I and II:

&gt;&gt;**Article I**. Each nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to transfer to any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; and not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, or control over such weapons or explosive devices.

Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly, or indirectly; not to manufacture or 
otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.

They condemn the deaths of innocent people

Again, look at the context. This post is about syrian rebels advocating violence. The top post is a post stereotyping islam.  The truth is that Syria is in a civil war which has Al Qaeda factions.  This has nothing to do with Islam.

"&gt;Washington has appeared divided because there is virtually no popular support for military action.

Well the last numbers I heard had [about 60% of US population against any US action in Syria](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/25/reuters-ipsos-syria-poll_n_3812792.html).  Only 9% are for action against Syria but that number raises to 25% if there was proof that Assad used chemical weapons.  That leaves about 15%-31% who are undecided or don't care.  Polls tend to be bullshit so it could be higher or lower, but either way thats not quite ""virtually no support"".

But if you'd been paying more attention you'd notice I'm not advocating for the US to attack Syria (more on that later).  I just posted the above paragraph to clear up what the actual support levels are, because if we're talking about attacking based on chemical weapons usage then ""virtually no support"" is not accurate.

&gt;Justification that's been well laid over years and has come to fruition in the nick of time for the ""rebels"" to get bailed out by American air support

To be fair, based on recent events over the past few years there was plenty of justification the instant we had proof that Assad was bombing the shit out of civilians, which we've known about for well over a year.  That was all the justification needed for Libya, well actually that and a UN resolution calling on us to do something.  But aside from the lack of a UN resolution calling for force to be used in Syria I don't see why they would have waited so long if they really wanted to go in.  They still don't have the UN resolution so what has changed now?  As far as I can tell the thing that has changed is that there is another alleged chemical attack, and I think the administration primarily wants to avoid projecting weakness. 

I don't think that is a very good reason to get in a military engagement but I also wouldn't shed tears for Assad if the US lobbed one or two missiles at a couple of his remote sites far away from civilians.  Israel already bombed them without any reported civilian casualties so it is possible, albeit unlikely.

 &gt;You believe this narrative is based on the truth about Syria's actions?

No, I don't really believe anyone in this situation because everyone has an agenda.  The US, Russia, Assad, the rebels; all of these factions have blood on their hands and would/have taken morally indefensible actions to further their own agendas at one point or another.  All of them are capable and even likely to lie to further their own interests.  

&gt;You always a sucker or just for liars in suits with flag pins?


Are you serious with this shit?  Why can't you just have a civil debate and not be a dick about it?  Careful pulling that shit on people when debating in person cause someone might get fed up and punch you in the face.

You're painting me as some ""RAH RAH AMERICA YAY GOVERNMENT"" asshole when I already said that I mostly lean towards ***NOT*** attacking Syria.  I specifically said that I don't necessarily think we should attack Syria but that under certain circumstances I could be OK with a limited engagement.  I did **not** say that I think we should just go in, I said we should only go in under very severe restrictions on our involvement that we likely wouldn't adhere to.  And **as I already said**, since it is unlikely that we would/could adhere to those restrictions I think going in would likely be a mistake.

You seem to not be catching on to the nuance of my position so let me spell it out very clearly for you:

There are some very restricted circumstances under which I would be OK with the US engaging Syria, but since the US has a bad track record with limiting their military engagements I think the odds of them meeting the criteria for my support are very slim.

&gt;The question to me is what's the end game: to prolong the civil war or to realize regime change.

The US's end game?  I would be willing to guess it is regime change.  They don't stand to benefit from the conflict continuing in any way that I can see.  On the other hand regime change would allow them to get someone in control of Syria that doesn't support Hezbollah or Iran, maybe even someone friendly with Israel if they're lucky.  That would be a big strategic win for the US.

Russia on the other hand could benefit from the war continuing because they are selling a ton of shit to the Syrian Army.  But then they sell shit to Syria anyway, and the war has brought a lot of Muslim extremists that much closer to Russia, so maybe they do want to end it.  But then again, all those extremists would need somewhere to go and they could flood into places like Chechnya.  So I would guess Russia wants it to go on long enough to kill as many rebel Muslim extremists as possible, and then once the threat to Russia has died down they would like to see it end quickly with Assad in power.

Assad?  He wants it over ASAP for obvious reasons.

The rebels also obviously want it to end, but they all have different ideas about what should happen to Syria afterward.  The different rebel factions probably have too many end games to count.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the extremists actively wanted the state to fail and stay failed so thy could operate freely like they do in Yemen.

It's a clusterfuck no matter which way you slice and dice it.  US involvement could make it worse or could make it better (not bloody likely though), either way it is going to turn out shitty.  I think the US administration knows how much of a coin toss it is and are mostly wanting to attack to project strength rather than weakness.  Which, again, is a shitty reason to engage.",1

"It's an interesting idea but intrinsically flawed. Selecting for survival doesn't select for nice, livable universes. Say some subset of the universes you get into a nightmarish car accident.

* A huge percentage of the possible universes from that point result in your immediate death, so they get pruned out

* Of the remaining universes, most of them have you survive a hideous, probably maiming injury. Anything that should have killed you instantly is probably going to leave a mark. Most of the universes are like this from the initial incident.

* Then there's the extremely unlikely future where you are completely unharmed somehow, thrown clear of the blast, whatever. There's not a lot of these, there's just going to be far more ways to break the complex system of your body than to result in no harm whatsoever, so statistically you end up with less safe worlds. 

Sure, it'd still be a large number of worlds out of ALL possible worlds, but that number is vanishingly small compared to the ones where you are seriously maimed. Since quantum immortality only selects for straight up elimination of consciousness, and not maiming, it would just mean that statistically everyone would end up maimed or 'conscious' (and thus surviving) without any hope of recovery from some terrible injury.

I mean, think of it this way. The guy who gets his arms and legs sawed off and his eyes ripped out, there's no reason he can't reach that branch. But he gets no easy selection for a quantum future that miraculously regrows those parts.",2

Here's my attempt: a government that can access all your digital communications is a government that you can't escape from.  Being able to go ""under the radar"" is one important check on the power of the government.  Suppose in the future the government starts persecuting some minority -- how will that minority ever hide from the government with a program like PRISM in place?

And if the government ever starts persecuting political dissidents -- for example arresting them, disappearing them, or otherwise ruining their lives -- it will be much easier for the government to know who to target and how to get them with a program like PRISM.  It will be harder for the people to organize against the government.

Also, programs like PRISM create an atmosphere of fear in which people are afraid to express politically dangerous opinions even in private.  People begin to self-censor themselves, feeling that Big Brother is watching us.  This is not the atmosphere of an enlightened and free society.

"&gt;To discount this, some homosexual activists have argued that moral imperatives from the Old Testament can be dismissed since there were certain ceremonial requirements at the time—such as not eating pork, or circumcising male babies—that are no longer binding. 

&gt;While the Old Testament’s ceremonial requirements are no longer binding, its moral requirements are. God may issue different ceremonies for use in different times and cultures, but his moral requirements are eternal and are binding on all cultures. 

&gt;Confirming this fact is the New Testament’s forceful rejection of homosexual behavior as well. In Romans 1, Paul attributes the homosexual desires of some to a refusal to acknowledge and worship God. He says, ""For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a base mind and to improper conduct. . . . Though they know God’s decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do them but approve those who practice them"" (Rom. 1:26–28, 32). 

&gt;Elsewhere Paul again warns that homosexual behavior is one of the sins that will deprive one of heaven: ""Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God"" (1 Cor. 6:9–10, NIV). 

&gt;All of Scripture teaches the unacceptability of homosexual behavior. But the rejection of this behavior is not an arbitrary prohibition. It, like other moral imperatives, is rooted in natural law—the design that God has built into human nature. ",0

No, I'm not.  A breakup of the US wouldn't be done by the people in Congress all agreeing to it; it'd be done completely against their wishes.  The people doing it would be people at the state level, basically rebelling against the Federal government (much like many states are *already* rebelling against the Federal government in many ways, such as with marijuana laws, immigration laws, firearms laws, etc.).  If the States decide to secede from the country, the wishes of the Federal politicians become irrelevant.

&gt;Asking the Dems or Reps to give up control of the country, to give up America, is a fantasy far more ambitious than any such gradual reforms.

I'm not asking them to give up control; when various states decide they've had it, their opinions won't matter any more.

&gt;I mean you're not even giving any argument as to why the size of the country is a problematic factor,

Simple comparison: there's no other country out there that has a democratic government, is the same size or larger, and which has a government that really works well.  The only other democratic countries of this size are India and Russia, and neither of those are exactly model countries.  The countries that work the best are the small, European countries, and the thing they have in common is they're generally not too large, and have more homogenous populations and less diversity.  It's hard to get anything done when no one agrees on anything and they're constantly fighting with each other.

"From ""what you know"".

The Likud charter states that the eastern border of Israel is the Jordan river. However, Netanyahu has endorsed the idea of a Palestinian state in the West Bank. Furthermore, it's *very* clear that no future border will take up all the West Bank; not even 15% of the West Bank would be Israel's:

[""Israel's opening position was that the border be the route of the separation barrier [wall], and not the 1967 lines as the Palestinians have demanded,"" public radio said in a report, which also featured in the top-selling Yediot Aharonot.](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/11/israel-says-separation-wall-will-be-border-201311514132609960.html)

[According to the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, 8.5% of the West Bank area will after completion be on the Israeli side of the barrier...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier)

So from what *I* know, a charter is not necessarily the position of Netanyahu or the entire government of Israel. Netanyahu is not a god amongst the politics of Israel; he is subject to the pulls of other parties as well, and public opinion.

Furthermore, you're once more contrasting Mandela's standpoints pre-Intifada (as far as I can tell) and pre-Hamas taking over Gaza, with the situations that followed. Even more than that, Obama too said the same about Israel (to a certain degree). The EU has definitely made comments along the same lines. The Israeli prime minister visited Turkey, despite the sour relations. Basically, bad relations or disagreements over ideology didn't typically stop Israeli officials from visiting other places at lower cost, when safety was still pretty guaranteed (obviously Iran is another case entirely for example). When it's over something like settlements, to suggest that Netanyahu is just snubbing the wake purely for political disagreement's sake is ridiculous.

Edit: Once more, I'd just like to reiterate that he also said Israel couldn't be called on to withdraw without Arab recognition, which hasn't occurred. So Netanyahu would probably feel *justified* by Mandela for the time being, at least.",2
"No, we also meant the rich.  As poor people understand, hard work might socially entitle you to something, but it does not entitle you to everything.  

It's just social conditions that exist in a particular way that allow people to become/be/remain well off in terms of property rights or not.

Furthermore, this also obfuscates the point of even having an economy/society/government, which is to advance human wellbeing, not for a few people to accumulate property rights.

So it's like, when someone invents a machine that eliminates an entire industry's worth of workers, we now live under social conditions in which that is a bad thing except for the people who own the machines, according to whatever rules/property rights we've set up.  That is not an intelligent way to order society.

Or, another example, if you happen to have some knowledge/capability that is somehow kept scarce, then you'll be paid a higher wage for it.  But if you actually teach/distribute that capability via the magic of digital technology, then your market value goes down - so the incentive isn't to be a teacher, it's to keep other people stupid/ignorant/incapable.  

Extreme wealth is also problematic for democracy, because once the people who have the power to change things become insulated from real problems affecting the rest of the population, then everything else goes to shit. 
http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/incoming-members-of-congress-not-exactly-average-joes/

This has already happened actually.  

Extreme wealth is de-facto corrupt, notwithstanding the social conditions that might allow for it at the moment.  Warren Buffett gets it, actually - he lives modestly despite the fact that socially he doesn't have to.  

""It should be a land of opportunity. And people that get rich. They -- nobody is going to confiscate everything or anything of the sort.

But the distribution in this country -- market system has led to extremes. A guy that is wired like me -- I don't have any special status in this world. I'm not -- a great nurse, a great teacher may be much more valuable to society than I am. I'm wired so that I can figure out what things are worth. So...Yes. So, I get super rich.

And somebody whose adenoids are in a certain arrangement gets rich. But television makes a lot of people rich. I mean, Lou Gehrig held out for $25,000 in the late '30s. You know, they benched him. They didn't bench him, breaking his streak, but he had a long -- he had a long struggle.

Television has made the .230 hitter or the .240 hitter better than Ted Williams at .406.

So, it -- there's a lot of serendipity. We -- everybody in this country owes their good fortune in some way to the rest of the country."" - Warren Buffett

"Sex feels awesome with or without a condom. You reach orgasm with or without a condom. However, sex without a condom is a lot more pleasurable, because of more sensitivity -- even if you can reach orgasm with a condom. Do you agree so far?

Circumcition lessens the penis sensitivity. Otherwise clothes brushing against your penis head would hurt you all day long, just like it hurts me if I pull back my foreskin and walk around with clothes on.

It seems to me that a lot of men who are circumcised just won't accept the fact that they would feel even more pleasure during sex if they weren't cut. I'm not saying it affects your life quality, because it's very unlikely it does. But WHY make the most awesome thing in life (slightly?) less awesome, when there's no benefit to be had from it? And how dare people make that choice for their children?

I'm a shorter than average guy, and I would probably get more attention from hot ladies if I were taller.

"None of the profiling done on terrorists by Reddit seems to have even a hint of truth if you look at the 9/11 hijackers.

They say terrorism is because of poverty. Yet with few exceptions the terrorists came from downright aristocratic families.

They say terrorism is because of lack of education. Yet the hijackers by and large had masters degrees or greater in STEM fields. 

They say terrorism is because we kill families in our imperialist excursions. Yet none of the hijackers had friends or family killed due to the actions of the United States. 

====
edit


People look at Islam further back in history and say, ""Hey, well, they were actually pretty decent to everyone during the Golden Age of Islam and even up into the Ottoman Empire"" so there have to be social and economic causes at the root of terrorism. Seeking economic factors is an exercise in futility, but people are not wrong to look at social causes. The problem is that people here are only willing to examine the social causes which conform to their narratives. My thesis is this: Islam was less violent and prone to terrorism (relatively speaking) in those days because they were the ones engaging in cultural imperialism, not the other way around. 

You can listen to the manifestos; the terrorists lay out what they are about surprisingly clearly. They speak about the 'corruption' of their youth, i.e., the westernization and americanization of the youth. They are angry about the exact same things our conservatives are (often hypocritically) angry about: videogames, movies, television, internet, pornography, music, books. There will have to come a time when people start to realize that Hollywood is the source of more terrorism than our excursions into the Middle East. 

They don't hate our culture per se, but they hate that they feel our culture is eroding their own. In this age of internet and free information, the entire world is experiencing a seemingly inexorable pull toward westernization. The tough truth of the matter is that our imperialism bears about as much responsibility for terrorism as tourism. When western troops are there, the youth tend to emulate them. VICE did a solid documentary in Iraq about this very thing. But with or without western troops, the internet would still be there. Hollywood would still be there. Our culture would still seep into theirs and provoke their ire. 

This is a problem with no simple solution. Pulling out of the Middle East and hoping the anger of the Muslims world will simple go away is no more than wishful thinking, but it is what Reddit wants to think. ",25

That's how the US Federal government works. It is in no way the only possible means of constructing a republic. Furthermore, it is a two hundred year old system that was constructed in a radically different time period.

Leaving the governance of three hundred million people in the hands of five hundred odd people who are very unlikely to lose their jobs is not democratic. We are not citizens just for the few minutes it takes me to fill out a ballot. People have a right and a responsibility to engage with policy making at any point in time.

Moreover, any loans have much lower interest than the nations could otherwise get. The IMF and World Bank don't CAUSE debt. They can't force loans on other countries. These nations would be borrowing money anyway. I agree that the loans are usually destructive long term, because the main condition is usually lower social welfare spending and more regressive taxes. This means they hurt those nations poor. But they certainly don't make nations any more in debt than they already are.

Developed nations also see not an ounce of gain from this. They would be better off issuing loans are regular interest through the regular channels. These organizations are charity. They are extremely ill thought out charity, but don't pretend they are malevolent.

Our government should definitely consider past policies and their consequences when making new decisions when it comes to foreign policy and military intervention. A lot of the mess in Latin America and the Middle East, for example, is the result of bad policies and decisions. (thanks a lot neocons!)

&gt; America should ignore the atrocity of 9/11, for instance, because 20 years before that, Reagan did some stupid shit in the middle east. Ignore the Taliban, because 15 years before, Bush I went into Iraq.

I never said that. 

And quite the opposite actually. America should revaluate its foreign policy and the way it does things to avoid another 9/11. We should be trying to proactively prevent these types of events through less aggressive means or maybe even by just minding our own business sometimes. People don't like it when you come stomping through their country fucking shit up, and some cultures, especially those where things like ""honor"" and ""revenge"" play a big role, tend to react quite differently than we are used to in the west.

1. Canada has a smaller population and it benefits Canada more than it benefits America to have a large population. Our elections don't cost 6 billion dollars. We don't have a military so big that our citizens literally have to fear for their safety outside of Canada because of meddling in foreign affairs worldwide pissing everyone off at us. It's more practical to have a safer central banking system and better healthcare program because of our smaller population. You as an American are one node out of some 330 million. I am one out of 33 million. In my system I go to an emergency room and they fix my sprained bones for free, in yours they tell you to put a bandaid on it and bill you for $800 dollars. I'm not even going to mention that Canada has more water, trees, oil and land per person compared to you in America, so the fact that you even thought bringing America's population up in this circumstance was completely stupid and clearly you were not thinking. Like honestly, what were you thinking in regards to bringing up your population. Your population makes it impossible for your country to even politically get along. One state has a 90% approval for gay marriage and another state has 90% against it. You have so many damned people that in 2000 one man had more votes to become President and another man won the election. Christ. Thank GOD that Canada doesn't have 330 million people. Our natural resources would be shot, our political system would be as fragmented, uncooperative, and TOO powerful just like yours. Gay marriage, right to abortion, it gets legalized by way of our SC throughout our entire land, in the US you do it by state, it takes a century, and in 2013 in most of your states you don't have equality of marriage or in some States the means to even get an abortion. From Halifax to Quebec City to Montreal, Waterloo, Toronto and BC. From the oil fields in Alberta to the fishing communities of Newfoundland if you go to any of those places you can marry who you please and get an abortion. 330 million people makes it a hard and vicious struggle to solidify what seem like common sense laws throughout your land.

2. Canada was settled first so technically you're all living on our border thanks. Also you should be thanking us for living on the border. We're your biggest trade partner. Do you like having ""stuff""? because I sure do so I think it's within both our countries best interest to have a large population next to the border. 

3. The fact that our cultures are so similar is a source of pride for many Americans and Canadians because it signifies the close friendship both our countries have. As your own President Kennedy said: ""Geography has made us neighbours. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners. And necessity has made us allies. Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder. What unites us is far greater than what divides us."". You would do well to listen to the wise words of your own President, instead of just ignorantly bashing Canada for no reason. Americans and Canadians alike benefit from the circumstances that bind us together and for you to be a total dick to Canadians is unwarranted and only serves to solidify the stereotype of Americans being assholes.

4. We keep our queen as our traditional head of state because we're a common wealth country. I can go to any country and enter a british or common wealth embassy in an emergency and get assistance. Can you as an American do that? Do you in America get tourism because of your ties with the queen? You don't and Canada does. We have the Queen as the head of state for similar reasons that in the United States the VP is still in charge of the Senate along with the President pro tempore, it's a tradition. The difference is our tradition generates benefits for Canadians and your tradition puts more dirty politicians on the payroll in your already oversized and too large political system, you ignorant son of a bitch :)

By the way you're damned right that a lot of us in Canada think the second amendment is stupid, because that's all it is: stupid. [These statistics speak for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) and I honest to god feel scared as hell when I'm touring around Texas and everyone in sight has a damned hand gun strapped to their belt or in their purse along with their miniature poodle.

"The only concession the Palestinians should have to make is to give up the Right of Return. 

The Israelis have illegally broken the borders the UN set for them. They are illegally blockading Palestine. They are illegally settling the West Bank. They are using illegal weapons on Palestinians. They are committing heinous war crimes and the talk is of ""concessions"". 

Were there concessions in Afghanistan? Iraq? Were there concessions when the Allies marched on the Third Reich? Then why is it that when the world is faced with similar terrorists in the state of Israel that we are not decrying them and making a stand? 

Would we rather have Hitler rise from the ashes in some sick irony as the government of Israel? Their actions mirror those of the Nazi regime impeccably and the only reason that region has not escalated out of control is the so-called ""Anti-Semitism"" of their Arab neighbours.

I can only pray for the day when the US wakes up from the brain washing Israeli propaganda machine and withdraws support from those murderers, sectarianists, racists, Zionists war criminals. Too long have Israel(disgustingly) benefited from the Holocaust, the death of nearly 6 million Jews has been milked for political gain for too long and the Holocaust Industry needs to die.

Yeah, the Palestinians aren't bloodless. Nobody would be in their situation. I would fight every day until my dying breath if my country was invaded by a foreign aggressor who had no right to be there. Not only that, when the borders were finally agreed upon it was broken by Israel. Hitler and Czechslovakia. The Rhineland. Austria. Poland. What's it going to take for people to realize Israel does not want to nor does it need to compromise with Palestine? Full out genocide?

"&gt; How has the NSA denied anyone the right to dissent or due process?

Right to dissent. In a healthy democracy, a citizen participates in the political process. The opinions expressed may be minority and very unpopular. For example ranging from 'We should not drone civilians in Pakistan, it is morally equivalent to the terrorists bombings that we so condemn' to 'Maybe the terrorists have actually some good grieviences against us and no means but armed struggle to express them'. But now, a person wanting to participate in the democratic process may hesitate, justly fearing that the intercepted information will be on record, impacting that persons live by for example dis-qualifying any future security checks as 'person of interests' or 'terrorist symphatiser' because thats what the software flagged you as.
QED. One of the many ways NSA intercepts denies you right to dissent.

Due process is easy. There is a legal process in the US, I belive its called FISA court, where intercepts need to be authorized. And while it is largely a rubber stamping process, NSA bypasses it, because it is 'too cumbersome'. The only difference between us and the savage barbarians is that we are a nation of laws, as soon as you start breaking the laws, we are no better than the lawless.",2

How would you trust that, you ask? Why would the agency accept being limited to that amount?

Because the way to easily monitor large amounts of data with little effort, NetFlow (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFlow) (RFC 3954) is illegal in Germany. It requires complete interweaving between agency and the provider of such an internet node.

So yeah, there definitely is some spying going on in Germany. And Merkel and her interior minister probably knew about the NSA stuff.

The BND does not store and record all data. I'm not saying everything in Germany is great and stuff, but the BND DE-CIX internet monitoring is not comparable to PRISM or TEMPORA. No one really doubted that European intelligence agencies did monitor internet traffic. What people didn't expect was the scope. All-encompassing surveillance of every Google or Facebook user (etc...), and that being recorded. It's a scary step up from the usual internet monitoring.",2

"I'm glad you brought up the English skills because I think this is the key thing leading them to this conclusion about ""unemployability"".  It may be the case that many colleges or students in India are not very effective.  Certainly that is the case in the United States.  I assume that since India has much fewer resources it is worse.

However, this article is largely being upvoted on the basis of racism against Indians and the conclusion that half of Indian graduates are unemployable is just not accurate or fair.  Its ridiculous.  Basically they are suggesting that any Indian graduate who is not fluent in English is not employable.

Imagine if we did a study of American college graduates and then evaluated them based on their proficiency in the Mandarin language or some other language.  We would have to conclude that 99% of American college graduates are unemployable.

I think that conclusion they are making mainly reflects the fact that the economic situation India, as it is in many countries, is quite poor and unfair.  There aren't enough jobs, and many of the ones that are available require the individuals to not only be fluent in two languages but also have a depth of knowledge and skills in a domain area.

The human brain does _not_ have an infinite capacity for knowledge or skills.  Truly fluent bilingualism requires a great deal of early training, practice, and more talent than average.  Without that early exposure its going to be a long difficult uphill battle to gain fluency in a second language.

Anyway, this is as much about the economic situation as it is about anything else.  Its just that the economics are harder to blame, so they blame the educational system or the individuals.  

I'm not saying that Indian education cannot improve greatly or that there aren't problems with colleges or educational techniques, but to come to the conclusion that half of the population is unemployable is not fair or accurate.  There may not be jobs.

"Yup, that isn't going to happen. Trying to section off a 1/4 of the worlds GDP would have massive economic consequences all over the world.

South America's little socialist block will whine for a bit then get quite, because at the end of the day oil from Venezuela funds them, and that oil is paid for by US consumers. The rest of S. America will go on selling its raw materials because they hate the Socialist block anyways.

The EU and the US are too tied together in almost every way. The EU already has enough economic troubles without trying to untangle itself from the US. If the EU actually cared about the whole spying thing enough to go against the US they wouldn't have denied their air space to the plane in  any case. They also want to insure that their actions do not encourage people like Snowden in their own spy agencies. Better to piss off a few Latin American Socialists with this then have all their spy programs come to light. 

China depends on US consumption to drive economic growth, which is already slowing, and could very easily collapse if the US economy takes a bad dive. The two things China cares about are growth, and stability. Sanctions are most certainly not conducive to that. They can use the situation to jab the US a bit but that's all they will do.

Russia really doesn't care either way, they want to sell their oil, and gas to Europe so they can maintain their military and economic growth. Sanctions against the US would cause prices to collapse which would hurt Russia really bad. Like China they will jab the US and EU a bit but that's it.

Most of the rest of the world doesn't care either, they just want economic growth. To get economic growth they want to create export driven economies that export crap the US buys, and hope that they can eventually transition to consumer growth. Sanctions hurt them so screw it.

Also remember how the US housing bubble collapsed and sent Europe, into rescission, how it almost broke the EU (there is still time on this).  How it dropped oil prices down massively, that would be a hiccup compared to what would happen. Imagine 25% of a countries economy disappearing, you would see a world wide depression. The US would be hit pretty hard, but the rest of the world would take it nearly as bad if not worse.

There is no special reason to think it would happen. It hasn't in the previous four campaigns the B2 was involved in. 

&gt;No, I do have a pretty simple point, which I've explained several times now. You're just pissed you missed it and trying to redeem yourself from the poor strawman you started with.

No, you implied that the B2 has some critical weakness based upon one article that is drastically outdated and another article that doesn't actually talk about a weakness, but rather a requirement for maintenance.

&gt;Are you being simplistic on purpose? Yes, if its stealth capability is compromised in a scenario like I described above, its lack of air-to-air combat ability would make it an easy target if detected. Without the stealth, it's a sitting duck. Hence the importance of maintaining the skin and limiting exposure. 

And again... its a *stealth* bomber, with no history of problems in that regard. 

You could point to any piece of tech and say ""well take away that critical component and its a sitting duck."" 

And besides, how is this different from literally any other long range bomber? 

Its not like we still use ball-turret gunners.

"In Australia you vote for a party not a person.

In reality a party elects a leader like a presidential candidate and they outline their policy and people go away and vote for their local party member. 

Liberals under John Howard were in for 12 odd years, Labor changed their leader to Rudd who convinced the nation that Labor was now different under him and people liked him so he was voted in with Gillard as his deputy. 

Halfway through his first term Rudd was fighting the mining industry to implement a tax on their profits, his popularity was expectedly low. The union movement who control the party wanted control of it again and got Gillard to backstab Rudd and go against him in a leadership ballot. She won and became a union puppet and called an election, Labor lost their majority to a reforming Liberal party and Gillard ended up with less seats than the Liberals. Gillard then cut deals with independents and the Greens to form a minority government. This Government was arguably the worst the country had ever seen and introduced policies that Gillard swore she would not. Rudd backers pointed out that their party was becoming less popular (29% of the nations vote down from over 50) and wanted the leadership back. Massive public infighting occurred within the Labor party resulting in a slander campaign against Rudd. Eventually after I think one failed Rudd challenge then another Challenge that no one actually challenged in the Labor party eventually decided that to avoid election wipeout they needed to go back to Rudd and his 60-70% popularity.

In other words they lead a chaotic government where they publicly fought each other and eventually imploded. 

In terms of the internet.

I personally don't blame Obama for it entirely, but I do think he could have put a stop to it and chose not to. As one of the few people in a position of military leadership who is *elected* he is the most important person to talk about, because he is the one the people had a choice in. His successors will see this response, and respond accordingly - if they think they will suffer come election time by allowing this sort of thing, they may think twice about doing so. Making up your mind to blame the program director is pointless. You have no power over them, except through the proxy of your elected officials. So, if elected officials are held to be responsible for constitutional violations by program creators, you get a little power over whether constitutional violations are tolerated. If elected officials are allowed to pass the responsibility to someone the general populace has no control over, then the general populace has no control. All you can do at that point is hope for the best.

It's not about whether you're *able* to handle it, it's about whether you should *have* to, and whether you *want* to have to do so for any moment of your life that you don't spend holed up inside. 

Not to mention that women have no idea how far a stranger will escalate his harassment. Some guys stop at staring and making faces, some do not. Some will make it a one-time thing, and some will develop a habit of it. My negative response to being stared at in this particular way is something I've learned through personal experience. ",53

Also, if it was the case that they are hunting whales solely for research, they should donate the meat to charity.

"There's a problematic assumption here: if something is widely hated, it must be for a good reason. Even a cursory look at history shows that it's not true, and in some cases, actually offensive (see: persecuted minorities).

Here are the facts:

1. **Israel is literally one of the most hated countries in the world**. Opinions polls put it as high as the top three least liked countries in the world, along with the likes of Iran and Pakistan.

2. **Israel is, by far, the most widely condemned country by the UN**. The UN, through its General Assembly and Human Rights Council, issues more condemnations of Israel than of any other country. The UNHRC, in particular, condemned Israel as much as all the other countries *combined*.

3. **Objectively speaking, Israel is not even remotely one of the worst countries in the world**. Not even in the top 50. If you read the Freedom House or Economist's Democracy Index reports, it's literally an oasis of (relative) freedom in a sea of oppressive, and often murderous dictatorships. 

   Even when it comes to the oppression/massacre of Palestinians, Israel doesn't come first: look up Black September, or how the Palestinians are treated in Lebanon. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a tiny, bloodless conflict, even compared to the conflicts that went on just a couple of miles away. For example, the literally unheard-of Hama massacre of 1981 had more deaths than the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict combined.

4. **Israel's worst crimes were committed when it was at its peak of popularity in the West**. That includes the Nakbah, massacres before and during the 1948 war, the military regime of Israeli Arabs, and so on. The decline in Israel's popularity in the West ironically coincided with the peace process - and more importantly, the end of the cold war.

5. **If you look outside the West, you'd see that Israel was hated worldwide since its inception**.  This includes both the Muslim and Arab worlds, who hated it for ideological and religious reasons, and the (former) Soviet sphere of influence, who hated them because of Cold-War alliances, often mixed with more than a dash of classic antisemitism. This was well before the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and it wasn't named as the reason either. The issue is that Israel exists on what a *huge* chunk of the world considers Muslim Arab land.

Conclusion: implying that all Israel has to do to win popularity is to change its ""actions"" is, unfortunately, naive and unrealistic. That doesn't mean that Israel *shouldn't* try to behave better - as an Israeli leftist I certainly believe that it should. But public perception has very little to do with actual policies and a lot to do with diplomacy, both public and inter-state.",26

"&gt; I did not realize you associated ethical costs with spying. Could you elaborate on what these are, in your mind?

Ethical costs? For a domestic government spying on its own citizens without warrant, that ethically and philosophically is not congruent with what I believe the role of government should be in our lives. For my government spying on another? I never did claim I see a massive ethical cost with that. Which you may differ upon naturally, but it seems to me you're ignoring the benefit side of the equation *with respect to this form of spying*.

&gt; It just doesn't follow, from what I can tell. If I'm spying on you, surely it would be in my interest to spy on your personal gmail as well as your business one. After all, you might share information personally that might be of use to me, information that I may not have gained were I only reading your work emails. Why shouldn't I spy on your personal email as well? What specific ""costs"" are you concerned about in such a scenario?

Sticking with states versus states? The same added ethical costs I see with targeting civilian non-combatants in a war as opposed to targeting militaries or governments. Or do you treat both as one in the same? My argument wasn't necessarily specific to work versus personal email, but an analogy to try and re-emphasize a clear distinction.

&gt; You're arguing in defense of spying and claiming it is a good thing. I'm not sure what ""nuance"" I'm missing that makes yours a position that isn't pro-spying.

My goodness, what part of ""I can see benefits to spying on *governments*."" don't you understand? My position is that there are benefits at least in this narrow case, nothing more nothing less.

&gt; If you agree that spying has ""ethical costs""...

Again I don't think I ever stated I believe spying has ethical costs with respect to on GOVERNMENT ACTORS... but go on... 

&gt; ...and you recognize the importance of information being available, you should be arguing in favour of increased transparency, mutual international transparency agreements, for powerful national actors to make good faith disclosures of information to kick-start the process.

It seems that you didn't even read much of what I wrote, which disheartens me. In my game theory passage I never made any qualitative judgements on the use of institutions (I've always believed in the liberal internationalist cause), but I provided what I believe to be a reasonably solid analysis of spying qua spying. Or put another way, *yes all of what you describe, I believe in their benefits*. Yet this says nothing about spying and its potential benefits and very real motivations, as the use of basic game theory can illustrate.

&gt; Instead you're crafting espionage apologetics.

I'm sorry, but my good faith with you has run out. You use the word ""apologetics"", which I can only assume was done so to refer to its negative religious associations. This flies in the face of what I wrote in my analysis being firmly in the realm of social *science* (economics). I will end with an ""agree to disagree"" line then—it seems you can't or won't engage with the substance of what I am writing.",1

That is an *exceptionally* interesting article from the perspective of state sovereignty theory re: Chomsky's Understanding Power.

The Russians are now aware of their own (and the US's) single minded obsession (as states) to acquire/consolidate power irrespective of economic/social ideology. 

The implication of this would be analogous to Orwell's 1984, although the real truth is that... this is how states have *always* behaved throughout time (re: Machiavelli's Prince) --&gt; all states behave equally.

So this idea of ""strategic insanity"" has a lot of meaning in a discussion about North Korea, the US, and even the USSR during the Cold War. 

My own interest is how Russia incorporates this new ""maxim"" into their state propaganda. I imagine they will become much more ""tolerant"" and ""socially aware"" of things like healthcare, education (state sponsored), etc. because they're now identifying that social unrest (as a result of economic ""warfare"") endemically threatens political sovereignty (as defined by Bacevich.)

&gt;Another lesson that Russia has learned from the events in Iraq is that nothing is irreversible in world politics. In the spring of 2003, when Baghdad crowds were smashing monuments to Saddam Hussein, it seemed that the era of relations between Russia and Iraq would end forever, and that Russian companies would be thrown out of the market — especially since the Americans wouldn't have invaded one of the Middle East's most oil-rich countries only to share this trophy with someone else. instead, Iraq today is run by a government which is by no means pro-American, and Russia is discussing major deals for the sale of weapons and for return of Russian oil companies.

""...I look back a few decades to my childhood and see things like caning, like mild pedophilia, and can’t find it in me to condemn it by the same standards as I or anyone would today.""

the full statement:

&gt;“I am very conscious that you can’t condemn people of an earlier era by the standards of ours,” Dawkins was quoted as saying. “Just as we don’t look back at the 18th and 19th centuries and condemn people for racism in the same way as we would condemn a modern person for racism, I look back a few decades to my childhood and see things like caning, like mild pedophilia, and can’t find it in me to condemn it by the same standards as I or anyone would today.”

is not significantly different from the shorter, sans-example quote i extracted his meaning from.

surely, you are able to realize this?

in fact, the full statement even *strengthens* ""my argument,"" by offering the model of premise that I find absurd: Just as we don't look back at the 18th and 19th centuries and condemn people for (slavery, rape, murder, theft, subjugation,--*insert your own form of abuse or subjugation*) in the same way as we would condemn a modern person [for same]. if you take his premise and apply a different form of abuse, you find how absurd and ridiculous is his argument. abolitionists who decried slavery were as right for it ""back then"" as they would be today, because slavery is ethically intolerable, and condemnable, regardless of the level of awareness of the slave masters of this fact. and mild pedophilia is as fucked up ""back then"" as it remains today, when people are more aware of just how wrong it is, and can more easily share their stories with others, and hear others' to prove this fact.

Why should they be asked to sacrifice for Greece, which is after all is a very wealthy country compared to most of the world, being 37th out of 185 on the IMF list, with a per capita GDP of $26,000.",1

"It takes a butt load of water to accomplish and that water then has to be pumped down injection wells because it is expensive to decontaminate. The water is often pulled from existing rivers, streams and lakes. Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water are pulled from where it would normally be for use in the fracing industry. The sites of some of these injection wells have been experiencing low level earth quakes (Oklahoma, Texas, Ohio) that are statistically linked to the injection well sites.

Ground water contamination is statistically linked to well sites in Oklahoma, USA.  The closer to a well site, the higher the probability of contaminated water.

Well pads are configured with up to 12 holes/pad (12 wells).  No one is sure what will happen to these configurations once the wells are shut off.  Stuff corrodes, local geologic events crack things. But once the well is no longer profitable and the well is 'plugged' according to the law, the company walks away leaving 12 pipes that are capable of transmitting anything upward through the geologic formation forever (or until they crumble in on themselves).

Fracking in the US takes approximately 100 truck loads of fluids/well. In the majority of cases, the fluids being transported are hazardous.  Trucks damage roads and sometimes go off roads, spilling the hazardous materials onto the ground for clean up (as best as they can).  Those fluids are then stored in gigantic open ponds (they're working on regulating this out). Those ponds are storing contaminated water. When the berms fail, the water escapes and contaminates local areas (often pastures where animals are killed).  Even without embankment failures, migrating birds can land in them... then... well.. woopsie.

Fracking requires a pipe infrastructure to move the extracted hydrocarbons cross country to processing facilities. Those pipes need to be maintained.  Unlike crude oil, natural gas pipes don't make a black oily slick on the ground. Instead they blast a big long trench. In Ohio, USA a cross country pipe, that was known to have problems, that the owner delayed fixing, blew up. The flame was seen over 50 miles away in the next state. It blasted a 20' wide trench 20' deep and over 100' long before the system shut off the natural gas.  Had the system not functioned correctly (and that was correct), it could have burned a massive torch for minutes or hours.  Even with the proper shut off, it melted the siding from a house that was 1000' away. The family were in the house at the time of the blast and only escaped by going out the back door and running through a field so that their house stayed between them and the heat of the blast.  That blast was lucky because it was in a hay field.  These cross country pipes are only required to be set back from houses by 100 feet. Had a leak developed in a community, the pipe explosion could have killed many people.

So, those are off the top of my head.",5

"Good comment.

To your second paragraph (starting with ""I'm""): People whose attitudes are tied to a dogmatic belief system really do have a disadvantage in forming reasoned opinions. Their opinions are constrained by the dogma - almost by definition. It may seem arrogant to suggest that, but some opinions truly are more reasonable than others (no matter how many people hold them), and more cognitive constraints allow a narrower field of vision. I'm sure that there are people who have less bias than I have; those people's opinions would tend to be more reasonable.

To your third paragraph: I don't deem them ignorant because they disagree. I don't know that they all do disagree. I think that I mentioned in a previous comment that there are probably people who have an opinion of the Church that's similar to mine but who have reasons not to enunciate them or even confront them internally. I do think that members of the Church are disproportionately ignorant, though. This is because of the dogma that tells them what to think and discourages them from reasoning. A desire to think that the Catholic Church only does good performs the same function: it closes people's minds to things that they don't want to confront - not all; maybe not most; but some of them, and it does so systematically, meaning that it's not merely that a certain kind of people are allured to such an organisation: it's the system that helps it along. [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ht1fk/pope_francis_it_hurts_my_heart_when_i_see_a/cay0jj8) sums up my argument that they're at a cognitive and discursive disadvantage.

I don't see how that second quote is evidence that I've written off their opinions. It's possible to hold the opinion represented by the quote without believing in the innate superiority of my opinion over those of many Catholics. I do devalue their opinions, but not because of that. I direct your attention to my question a few posts ago about a supervillain with a very large following.

You'd agree that my opinion (2+2=4 is the one that I'm referring to) has more weight because you hold the opinion yourself. If I had the opinion that pi's 1,000,007th digit was 9, would you give my opinion more weight than another? I think that you would if you came to the same conclusion yourself, but, if you weren't sure of the answer, you'd probably give them equal weight. Just like you, I give more weight to the opinions that make sense. I'm not saying that you should agree with my opinion because of that; you should agree with my opinion if you freely come to the same conclusion that I do. If you are aware of people being restricted in their reasoning (as I've claimed of many members of the Catholic Church), it's reasonable to demerit them. It's not reasonable to shut the door on them entirely, but it's helpful to have probable shortcuts to a valid opinion. We can bump the opinions of certain people back in the line of explanations to consider. Considering every opinion equally would make some decisions last an eternity.

I'm not more likely to accept an opinion just because many people hold it, and I'm not any *less* likely to dismiss it on that basis alone; but I would probably pay more attention to it - if not because I think they might be right, then because it is likely to have a greater effect on the world than would an opinion held by only a few people.

People are sometimes dishonest or unreasonable. This commonly happens when they have a personal interest in protecting the focus of discussion. I wouldn't trust psychics to tell me how effective psychic readings are, despite their large numbers.",1

"Not a ""couple thousand"" see quote at bottom.

Because the MGM that you're talking about doesn't cause much pain or damage to adult men, though yes it may be linked to loss of sensation, etc.  There is also research that says it lowers transmission of sexually transmitted disease.  I've dated more than a few men, and they've all said the same thing--what are you talking about (when I've asked if they regret being circumcised and if they had any ""loss of sensation"") and no fucking way (when asked if they'd reverse it).  FGM happens IN THIS COUNTRY even, thogh quiteand even if it happens only a few times, I think it's horrible (as you clearly do).  But to even talk about men in western society being circumcised, and comparing that in any way to FGM, is really lacking perspective.

And by the way, just because women in Ethiopia aren't American, doesn't mean they are negligible, and I would hardly say that 75% of the country's women is a small number.  Do some research.

Ethiopia has one of the highest levels FGM in Africa, where, according to the 2005 Demographic and Health Survey, 74 percent of girls and women nationwide have been subjected to the practice. The animators of Enemore Epicenter identified three of their own kebeles (districts) still widely practicing the harmful tradition and began specific and repeated training campaigns to discuss the numerous disadvantages of FGM.

One animator, Mr. Teka Bataga, shares his experience with the campaign:

“Last week a friend and neighbor of mine told me he is planning to circumcise his one-year-old daughter. I told him, soberly and after choosing the right moment for our discussion, about the disadvantages of this harmful practice. We, the animators, were lectured on this subject. I told my friend and neighbor: FGM is often performed in poor sanitary conditions by traditional practitioners with immediate and long-term health consequences. Immediate complications include excruciating pain, shock, urine retention, ulceration of the genital regions and injury to the adjacent tissue. Other complications include blood poisoning, infertility and obstructed labor and more. Then my friend and neighbor remarked, “I was about to kill my only daughter. Thank you for such valuable information. As of today I will be a campaigner against FGM too.""

"Most stores will still accept pennies, they're going to continue being legal tender just as the $1 and $2 bills have been.

What happens is that banks will continue to accept them, but will no longer issue any. So if you're a store owner, you can't go to the bank and get rolls of pennies for your till after today. Any pennies you do get from customers you can bring back to the bank, and the bank will send them to the mint to be melted down.

Gradually, almost all the pennies will find their way out of circulation though being spent or deposited, and you just won't see them around anymore. We did the same thing with the $1 and $2 bills when the loonies and toonies came out, now you hardly ever see the bills. Ten or twenty years from now you will still be able to bring pennies to the bank for deposit, if you still have them, you just won't be able to get any more.

Retailers are not *required* to accept them (they actually aren't required to accept them already in the same way they can refuse to accept $100 bills if they want to) but if they refuse to accept pennies, they have to round according to the standards set out - .01 and .02 round down to .00 , while .03 and .04 round up to .05. This is only applicable on the final total after tax, and only if paying by cash - if you pay by debit the actual amount is charged.

Edit: I find this to be a very good way of making these kinds of changes happen. The US has never successfully switched from dollar bills to dollar coins simply because they keep making the bills and make the adoption ""voluntary"". What they should do is stop making the bills, ramp up production of the coins, and when banks want ""ones"" from the gov't (Fed Reserve? Whatever their equivalent of the Bank of Canada is) they are given the option of coins or nothing. Bills continue to be legal tender, but as they're deposited into banks they're returned for destruction and the transition takes care of itself. ",6

You didn't know what Trayvon looked like that night, but that didn't stop you from declaring that he was obviously suspicious, until I beat that contention out of you.  You say you're not a racist, but you are calling Zimmerman's instincts ""spot on"" when he stalked and shot a kid with skittles and tea who had *committed no crime that night*.  How were his instincts ""spot on""?  

You want to talk about ""instincts""?  How much do you even know about concealed carry?  Zimmerman broke the biggest rule of concealed carry, which is that putting a gun in your waistband does not make you a motherfucking police.  Beyond that, every neighborhood watch I have ever heard of explicitly tells its members to a) not go armed, and b) just call the police and let them handle things.  Zimmerman violated both of those basic rules.  Were these reckless actions in violation of the basic rules of concealed carry and neighborhood watching also ""spot on"" instincts?  

And I'm calling you a racist because you are one.  There is zero reason to call Trayvon suspicious.  Being black in a white neighborhood isn't enough, no matter how much you want it to be.  Instead of telling people to read different things, maybe you should take a long hard look at this case and carefully consider whether it is a good idea for you to appoint yourself the marshal of justice and follow people around your allegedly nice neighborhood.

"&gt; Your argument was:
&gt; What is your solution then? Have the government steal from those who work hard and give to the lazy?

That was a question, not an arguement.
&gt;Without taxes no government could function.

Not necessarily, if taxation was voluntary then a consensual form of governance would be possible.  
&gt;Without government no society has ever provided a decent standard of living.

This very arguement was used by slave based societies in the past. ""If all successful societies have slaves how could we have a decent society without slaves?"" Also your use of decent is ambiguous. 

&gt;Therefore this ""theft"" is morally proper.

Staying with my analogy (and going by your logic) we can say since all successful, societies had slaves, slavery must therefore be proper. 
 

This isn’t rocket science. It really shouldn't be that hard to understand that taxation is the same as theft. To call it “proper” is nothing more than propaganda. Maybe you think stealing is ok, and you like to steal in order to get what you want, but I don’t. And Im not going to pretend stealing is good.

In 2007, the Okinawan were upset about the removal of that issue from textbooks (which I believe has been put back in due to the demonstrations). The reality is a mix of both. The Imperial Japanese military had made lots of propaganda, rooted in mixed truth, that the US didn't take prisoners and would rape and kill everyone. While the US soldiers during WWII rarely raped, they definitely had quite a few instances in which they took no prisoners - of soldiers. The end result was a thousand families, misinformed, jumped to their deaths together. It was terrible.

That said, it did imply that having a better working-memory made Ritalin more effective, and ADHD often includes deficits to working memory.

These people are doomed to bask in their impure ignorance. They deserve nothing and will continue to be used and abused by the system. Such is the nature of our systems of modern civilizations.

You're basically trying to instill sense/reason within folks who actually get swept up under Obama's, Kerry's, and Hagel's military rhetoric; people who actually *believe* what the President says yet they couldn't even point Syria on a map or even tell you why the Syrian conflict even started. Those people don't know the difference between the Al-Nusrah front, or Al-Qaeda ISIS.

These people don't understand that ""surgical"" strikes in highly densely populated areas will only contribute to more death and destruction and empower Assad to keep the war going. He's got Russia's, Iran's, and China's backing. He won't just crumble and go away. The main reason why we're entering the war is simply because Assad has been winning back the country over the last 8 months and Obama committed himself with his ridiculous talks of redlines and other bullshit.

Most people here are not aware of the fact that over the last two weeks, the number of refugees pouring across the Jordanian, Lebanese, and Turkish borders has increased **two-fold** because of Obama's call to bomb the country back to the Stone Age. They don't understand (or refuse to understand) the implications that our machine of death and destruction inflicts on other countries.

Last but not least, this is the question that is going to piss people off the most since it asks them to look within themselves and challenge their pre-conceived notions of what war truly entails: our gov't is the biggest user and abuser of chemical weapons in modern warfare history. What moral authority do *we* have to tell other countries that they should not use chemical weapons? The hypocrisy runs to the high heavens. 

Our nation's history with chemical weapons since the Korean War of 1953 includes:

1. Chemical Orange (known as ""napalm"") in Vietnam. The unprecedented use and amount we used over there is still disfiguring and causing terrible childbirth deformations almost 50 years after was over.
2. White phosphorous bombs used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. is the *only* country in the world (along with Israel I believe) who didn't sign the treaty to stop the use of white phosphorous which I shall remind you burns through human flesh in horrific way.
3. Depleted uranium shells which kill our own soldiers and have polluted the ground so much in Fallujah, the readings of radiation in the air were higher than Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

"&gt; Again, I'll admit total ignorance, but if someone can provide me evidence/source that the % of the SRA that support Al Qaeda is greater than 1%? I'd be surprised.

Ummm The whole paragraph before you wrote this, you admitted that there obviously has to be AQ there. You implied that AQ is ubiquitous throughout the whole region and there's no reason to be surprised AQ is fighting the government. And in the very next breath you put their prevalence at only 1%? That's it? And if you're right, 1% is still more of a reason than any other for OUR TAX DOLLARS not to be spent funding them.

Here's my whole angle: We know there's AQ mixed in with the rebels, we have no idea who these rebels are or what their real intentions are, and we know they are just as brutal as Assad (there's video of rebels eating the hearts of dead soldiers). So we have two options. We can get involved in the clusterfuck or we can let it play out and not be involved. 

So we should not be involved, end of story. It's that simple. If there's ANY CHANCE AT ALL that a single AQ member receives a SINGLE DOLLAR from the money taken out of my paycheck every week, then ITS NOT WORTH IT, period.

"China's 'super duper mega economy' is the 2nd largest, clocking in at 12.383 trillion in 2012 in PPP terms, which is 80% of the US economy (15.653 trillion). Given that China is projected to grow at 7.5% and the US at 2%, China is pushing 90% of US GDP size. 

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)#Lists

Given China's sheer size in terms of population, which is more than 4 times the US, China will only need to achieve a GDP per capita of 1/4 the US, to be parity in size to the US. if it can achieve a GDP per capita of 1/2 of the US, it will be twice the size of the US. If it reaches South Korea/Japan per capita levels (about 80% of US GDP per capita), which is an extremely reasonable assumption, China's total economic size will be more than 3 times the US.

You mentioned building entire cities that remain empty indefinitely. The empty cities listed by the media over again and again are: Ordos &amp; Zhengzhou, those are the only two, perhaps you could list more examples? Even given 10 cities that are permanently empty, China has more than 100 cities that have a population of more than 1 million. The scale of China's economy, population and sheer size dwarfs these 'empty cities'. 

I understand PBS/Vice did documentaries about ghost cities in China, for a more on the ground/less sensationalist look, http://thechinachronicle.com/zhengzhou-zhengdong-china-largest-ghost-city/

You mentioned 'fake' numbers. Some shenanigans definitely happen in the local counties where local officials want to impress higher ups, but to discount an entire economy as 'fake' sounds more like wishful thinking rather than sound analysis. This is the second largest economy on the planet, you can't fake that shit when the entire world is looking at you and analyzing you everyday. 

You mentioned 3+ generations to catch up with western standards. In the 1980s, China was so poor most of the urban population has not even seen a working flushing toilet, not to mention the rural folks. In a single generation, China's eastern seaboard cities has been transformed from Godforsaken shitholes into world class urban areas that can go toe to toe with London/New York. That's 1980 to 2010, in 30 years. The transformation is already happening with cities in Central China like Chongqing and Chengdu. 

with regards to the population being badly educated, lets have PISA do the talking here. 
-Shanghai clocking in at No.1 
-even in impoverished areas in China, the educational standards achieved is the OECD average
Source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17585201

You may list a ton of China's weakness, but if you're going to downplay their strengths and not sit up straight and recognize the sheer challenges you are going to be facing, you are in for a very very rough time. China today is pulsing with desire to restore itself to greatness and it will stop at nothing until it becomes the most powerful country on the planet.",2

"well admitadley it's starting to feel that way about mass shootings isn't it? I personally think we need to rebuild the failing mental health infrastructure in our country. But there also seem to be some societal encouragements behind that too.

Really I think, as a country, we do need to sit down and take a serious look at the whole picture of why these things are happening. Hell there's alot of issues not involving gun violence and just threatening and bullying between people that I see as a big issue, something that's getting out of control and also leading to some of these issues.

But don't get me wrong, our issues are actually kinda mild compared to some others. Japan and China for example, are having some really bad issues in that respect too. Don't forget in the several past years the knife attacks on random civilians in recent places, one of the worst ones I remember being the Otaku killer that went on a rampage in the Akihabara quarter in Tokyo. China had one a few years ago too from my memory, and there's probably plenty that here in America we're not getting. There are serious social issues throughout the world leading to these sort of behaviours in people who become mentally sick and one of the cultural issues that's pretty pervasive anywhere is 'you don't talk about it, you don't let anyone know you're sick, you keep on going like nothing is wrong because people will hate you for being sick'.

The reasons were many, including Soviet Bloc influence, Nasseriesm as a unifying political ideology, the New Left, and the fact that Israel was a medium-income country, not able to fight the prevailing Arab League boycott. the post 1967 economic boom changed that: israel became an economic force worth trading with, even at the cost of upsetting Arabs. The peace with Egypt helped too. Finally, the collapse of the Soviet Union, a strong anti-Israeli force, and a supporter of Syria and Palestinian armed groups helped too.

Ok, you've used the word 'flea' to describe entire countries. You've explicitly stated you don't believe in separate countries being able to oppose US foreign policy. So, you want a government that's barely influenced by it's small fraction of the worlds population to have complete global dominance. Almost makes world war 2 seem like a waste of energy.

"&gt; Many analysts believe that all of our drone strikes and military interventions in the Middle East have created and continue to create more terrorists enemies and/or terrorist sympathizers than we can kill, which creates a never ending cycle.

I don't think that this argument has been made for anywhere other than for the Taliban in Pakistan. The Pakistani Taliban is not even attempting to take control of that country. They are just trying to not get wiped out of the Tribal areas by the Pakistani military and American drones. Even in the worst case scenario they will never expand out of their mountainous border region. The 30,000 strong Afghan Taliban is never going to be able to take down the democratic government in Kabul which has 200,000 soldiers and widespread support domestically and internationally. In Iraq Al Qaeda is one of the smallest factions within the Sunni minority and there is no one who thinks that the minority Sunni minority will ever be in a position to take power over the majority Shia in Iraq ever again. In Syria, again Al Qaeda is a minority faction within the rebel movement which is on the losing side of the civil war. In the Gulf the monarchies have almost completely eradicated Al Qaeda. Iran has been ramping up efforts to squash Al Qaeda abroad and to support Shia movements. I could go on, but there is not a single area where Al Qaeda is even prospectively looking at emerging as a dominant power. The fact that we are not making very effective progress in our drone war against the Pakistani Taliban in the border region of west Pakistan has nothing to do with AQ's prospects for achieving its goals. 

&gt; Add in the revelations about the massive scope of expansion of the U.S. global surveillance operations, all driven by the aftermath of 9/11

You forgot to mention how this is relevant to anything. How does this have to do with AQ achieving its goals. If anything this is bad for AQ because it now has slightly less of a chance of carrying out further terrorist attacks. 

&gt; U.S.' global standing in terms of animosity and resentment by the rest of the world, both foes and friends alike, as well as our own citizens here at home, has never been worse.

The US has a much better standing internationally since the late Bush years. We have allies all over the Middle East like we always have and just now tensions are subsiding with Iran which bodes well for the prospects for peace in the region. 

&gt; If we are creating more new enemies than we are killing, and alienating the rest of the world with our actions, eventually it will create a geopolitical tipping point. And that is the primary difference between us and them, we see things in very myopic short term outcomes, they see things in long term outcomes.

A geopolitical tipping towards AQ? Are you serious? Who is it that will start siding with AQ? Every single major power is completely opposed to AQ. It has zero allies and it will never have allies. You need to lay out a theory for how in AQ's 'long game' Israel will be destroyed, Saudi Arabia will not have foreign presence in its borders, and all the muslim regimes will fall and be replaced by radical Wahhabist Emirates and then will join together into a Pan-Sunni Caliphate.

"&gt;After months of difficult negotiations, Serbia and Kosovo reached an agreement on Friday aimed at overcoming ethnic enmities in Kosovo, a former Serbian province. It is a milestone that officials hope will enhance stability in the region and clear a path for both countries to join the European Union.

 

&gt;Catherine Ashton, of the European Union, with the Serbian leader Ivica Dacic, left, and Hashim Thaci of Kosovo on Friday.

&gt;Catherine Ashton, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, told reporters that the prime ministers of the two countries had initialed an agreement during talks in Brussels. “It is very important that now what we are seeing is a step away from the past and, for both of them, a step closer to Europe,” she said.

&gt;Serbian officials said the accord was subject to approval by “state bodies” in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. But European officials said it was unlikely that Serbia would backtrack.

&gt;The European Union is scheduled to meet Monday in Brussels to decide whether to allow Serbia to start negotiations for entry into the group, and analysts said the accord was likely to swing the decision in Serbia’s favor.

&gt;The agreement hinged on how much autonomy Kosovo was willing to cede to Serb municipalities in the north, in return for Serbia’s recognition of Kosovo’s authority in the area. Until now, Serbia has had de facto control over the small Serb-majority area in the north, which does not recognize Kosovo’s authority.

&gt;Tensions have lingered since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after NATO bombs helped push out the forces of the Serbian strongman, Slobodan Milosevic. For Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian Muslim majority, independence was the culmination of a struggle for self-determination after a brutal ethnic civil war with Serbia.

&gt;Kosovo is now recognized by more than 90 countries, including the United States and a majority of nations in the European Union. But five member countries, including Spain and Cyprus, have refused to recognize Kosovo.

&gt;Serbia has also refused to recognize Kosovo, arguing that its declaration of independence breached international law. Serbia’s staunch ally, Russia, has blocked Kosovo’s membership in the United Nations, a hurdle to its economic and political progress.

&gt;Under the agreement, municipal bodies in the Serb-majority north will retain autonomy in matters like health care and education. In return, the police and courts will apply the Kosovo central government’s laws. The Serbian municipalities will be able to appoint a regional police chief.

&gt;Petrit Selimi, Kosovo’s deputy minister of foreign affairs, said Kosovo agreed not to deploy its security forces in the Serbian region for an unspecified number of years, except during emergencies like earthquakes. Even in that event, a senior NATO official said, the security forces would need authorization from NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo.

&gt;Analysts said the deal had been made possible, in part, because of the nationalist credentials of the respective leaders in the talks, including Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of Kosovo, a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who told reporters that the agreement would “help heal wounds of the past.”

&gt;Even so, Mr. Thaci is despised by many Serbs for his role in the war. His Serbian counterpart, Prime Minister Ivica Dacic, was the wartime spokesman of Mr. Milosevic, who died in jail in 2006.

&gt;The accord conspicuously omits any Serbian recognition of Kosovo’s independence. But analysts said the agreement was nevertheless a breakthrough.

&gt;For the European Union, struggling with a string of crises, the accord is also an important victory. “The incentive of joining the E.U. played a huge role in clinching an agreement,” said Mr. Selimi, the Kosovar deputy minister.

&gt;Misha Glenny, a leading Balkans expert, said the symbolism of Serbs and ethnic Albanians casting aside their differences could help spur regional reconciliation, in particular in ethnically divided Bosnia.",1

2) China will oppose a US intervention openly, but secretly be relieved to be rid of NK, its drama, and the constant US presence because of NK. Leaked classified documents from wikileaks suggested that the country might actually be ok with a US occupied Korea, though they probably won't admit it in pulbic.

Most people thought that meant ALL Americans. From my perspective it didn't. It meant, just those Americans who did fete him. If I intended to say ALL would of used that as a prefix. Well that's a lesson learnt. 

Why do non-Americans write about America? The fact the country is so pervasive throughout the world. Absolutely fascinating. I am highly amused why average Europeans are infatuated with the USA. My guess was that as ""Ëurope"" was class stratified, American culture (excuse my wordage) is so crap, it became completely accessible. I lived in the Netherlands for a while and couldn't believe the American programmes they showed (this was when NL had a 22:00 TV curfew!) were the real cheap blonde bimbo, tinsel and glitz. Why I asked. I guessed it was because Europe didn't have it. Of course once that sort of Americana became popularised the European's found it acceptable to devise Eurotrash.

Seriously though, if as an American you want to see how thoughtful outsiders perceive you, Alistair Cooke is the man to read. He opened my eyes up to your society. And consequently, from his knowledge and insight it is why I loathe the American right now so much. People just don't understand what Cheney (and Bush) did. Made my error again.

As for the future. I think China being so successfully secretive will make some spectacular jumps in technology that will have significant military and economic consequences.  The NSA thing I believe may have started from far right paranoia but is fuelled by the Chinese way of ""doing"" their society. 

For that reason I think we need an open society where corporations don't syphon off our economic wealth. We need the middle classes more than ever to become, to create economic growth. 

That feeds in to my hate of Rupert Murdoch. He dumbs down our societies to make sure govt's are not threatened by the people and he retains blackmailing power over those govt's. Can you imagine our societies if the significant producer of economic growth was centre stage. Science. Fundamental science. Applied science.

"Well I'm sorry I was wrong then about the forced marriage, breaking that cultural tradition is going to be harder.

I'm going to bed, I'll happily believe you that people are crossing lines though.  However, I do want to say the following.  

First off, it should go without saying that India is indeed a very big and complex country with many different cultures, traditions, and lifestyles. It's a rich society, home to some of the oldest civilizations, religions, philosophies, technologies, and the like in the world.  But without diminishing their accomplishments, we can admonish their problems.  

Any subcultural group that would force a 6 year old girl to marry the 8 year old son of her rapist is a savage one.  Any culture that doesn't define forced spousal sex as rape has a rape culture (I've been lectured plenty on the USA having one and can buy that to some extent as well). Just as my ancestors were barbarians and savages at one point, some people are today.  The word may have ugly connotations and other unacceptable uses, but to mitigate the barbarity and savagery of this act by avoiding ugly terms is inexcusable.  (I'm not saying you are, I think hairs are being split).  Notice I'm making a simple statement here, not one that should be extended to those who do not fit it.  All human societies have the ability to embrace the savage and the civilized, sometimes within them, they are both.  If you are unwilling to label these groups this way or apply this judgement, then I don't know what to tell you.   I'd apply this same judgement to some of the cults and much of the unreformed latter day saints in the USA.  Savagery and barbarism should not be excused.  We actively pursue these groups, so should they.  These do not appear to be cases of random sickos, rather they stem from institutional fuckups like these caste councils and deeply ingrained cultural traditions in what appears to be sizable populations within the subcontinent.

I'm frankly not concerned with what a bunch of random redditors think. They/we are an odd group, eager to blame the USA and praise NW Europe but often also eager to simplify and generalize problems in Muslim societies and India.  Part of what you are seeing is that India is an open country with a working press, so we see their problems easier than we might see Pakistan's, Burma's, Yemmen's, or others. Also a lot of their stories have a particularly outrageous effect.  Just like as crime in the US has gone down yet school shootings cover the news for months making it look worse... or Mexico, who's crime rate had also dropped but made international attention with heads dangling from freeway overpasses. 

Indians are human beings, rational and irrational like the rest of the world.  They are a democracy and they need to address these issues and be held to as high a moral standard as other nations.  Is this largely a problem of poverty?  Yes, in that poverty goes hand in hand with intolerance, archaic traditions, lack of education, lack of opportunities, lack of transparency, and poor political results.  But nevertheless these people should be addressed for their problems like people.  To do otherwise would be paternalistic or worse.

My previous comments were all about statistics.  My intent wasn't to make judgments or engage in debates about what nation should be focused more.  I addressed an inaccuracy.  These shouldn't be tolerated to try and cover biases elsewhere.  Facts are facts and there's no point in debate if we casually wave them off.  

I don't know why criticizing what happened in this news story would offend you, maybe they've been over represented and other people's ills have been under represented.  Nevertheless I will end my overly long tirade with this.  Don't excuse the misuse of statistics, the minimization of the horrors of what happened to that 6 year old girl, or the fact that the people of India have some real problems they need to fix.  That. Isn't. Cool.  Dude/dudette. ",1

The belief that human skin is shameful and should be covered is silly.  There is nothing wrong/immoral about nakedness.  People should be allowed to determine their own comfortable dress and go as clothed or as naked as they choose as long as there are no ulterior motives (ie: sexual predation of minors).

Certain circumstances, such as participating in a public hearing, require certain levels of dress specifically for the purposes of identification.

I can see the parallel that you are drawing.  If a woman needed to be identified by markings on her breasts people would think that it was reasonable for her to request a private viewing and what the Muslim woman is doing can be seen the same way.  To a certain extent I agree with that but the sense of modesty can only be accommodated up to the point where it obstructs justice or leads to the perception that justice has not been served.  

In this case the woman's face needs to be seen by the judge, the jury, the prosecutors, and the witnesses in order for there to be a fair trial.  It may be counter to her sense of modesty but modesty must be set aside when necessary.",0

"Actually corrupt bankers and inside traders generally are still allowed to work in that sector. The social stigma against convicted felons - one that does not exist here in Europe to the degree it does in the USA - is what has created a third criminal class in the States.

These are the individuals who get charged with felonies for drug violations, assault, other minor violent crimes and rehabilitated offenders who are released after committing major crimes (murder, robbery, etc.).

I've seen the differences between a punitive and a rehabilitative criminal justice system in both countries. I prefer the way we handle things here in Europe, frankly. It has resulted in lower crime rates and a lower prison population. I have no problem with a man being rehabilitated, released early after serving 14 years and going on to become a productive member of society.

Because people asked for it and people decide what becomes law, not Monsanto.

Because no one has ever asked for it.

&gt;We don't label for practices, whether those are proper soil management, pesticides used, or whether the cow was milked by an observant Jew.

"Margaret Hodge is one of the main critics of tax avoidance in the UK. Her company pays even less tax

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hodge#Public_Accounts_Committee

&gt; There have been concerns raised in the national Press over the fact that as Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Hodge is leading an investigation into the controversial tax arrangements of a number of US companies operating in the UK when her own family company 'pays just 0.01pc tax on £2.1bn of business generated in the UK'.[38] However, the same newspaper subsequently apologised to her, stating that ""there is no inconsistency or hypocrisy in Ms Hodge criticising other companies for tax avoidance and [we] apologise to her for any contrary impression"".[39] She has also been accused of lacking understanding of how the taxation system operates, both the existing statute and the process involved for amending it.[40]
&gt;
&gt; Stemcor, Hodge's family company, was founded by her father Hans Oppenheimer more than 60 years ago. Analysis of Stemcor’s latest accounts show that the business expected to pay UK corporation tax of just £157,000 on revenues in the UK of more than £2.1bn in 2011. The UK tax payable on the group's global profits of £65m was only £743k, reduced further by £586k in respect of tax that had been overprovided in prior years. The company explained that the low effective rate of UK tax was because they incurred a loss in the UK in 2011 due to difficult trading conditions.

The whole tax avoidance controversy is bogus. Obviously companies will pay the minimum amount of tax they legally can. Hodge beating up prominent multinationals is a way to try to shame them into paying more tax without changing the rules. That means companies like STEMCOR will continue to pay as little as possible whilst Google, Starbucks etc pay more. 

If Hodge really wanted to change things she'd find out which loopholes STEMCOR use and close them. 

It's also disingenuous to conflate tax avoidance with tax evasion. Tax avoidance is playing inside the rules and paying what the tax people demand. Tax evasion is lying on your tax forms. Tax avoidance is not illegal and tax evasion is. ",1

"Hi, I'm an ASL interpreter in the US. It's weird to me that a lot of people seem to think signed languages are universal, so it's difficult to figure out how to explain that they not.

 It's easier for me to understand why some people think American Sign Language is just English on the hands. They assume it's just a different method of producing English, like writing or speaking. It's not. Since there's no deaf homeland, typically the deaf of any particular country absorb a fair amount of the popular culture and varying degrees of language from the dominant hearing culture. But the signed languages themselves tend to have grammatical features that just don't exist in hearing languages.

Hm. Ok.

 ASL is based on French sign, LSF. It has very little in common with British sign, BSL. In signed languages, there isn't really a direct one to one relationship of meaning between an individual spoken language word and an individual sign.  For example, we have several different words for shit: feces, crap, poo, poop, diarrhea, turds, stool, and so on. The word we select depends on the connotation we intend to convey. Whether we're discussing it clinically, medically, crudely, semi-politely, metaphorically...There are two ASL signs for shit, each conceptually accurate: the literal substance, and the metaphorical usage. How you interpret it into spoken English depends on the context it's being used in. It depends on the signer's meaning and the environment. 

Signed languages are capable of conveying concepts as complicated and abstract as spoken languages, but as is true for any language, some things are much easier to say than others, and some concepts lend themselves more easily to expression.

Many compound signs are formed by conceptually blending two different signs. For example, in ASL, the sign for believe is a contraction of the signs THINK and MARRY. To be married to an idea. The sign for HOME is a modified contraction of the signs for FOOD and BED. The sign for ""scan vertically through the list and eliminate redundancies"" requires the set up of what's being discussed, and it'd be easier to show you a video. Suffice to say, I saw the concept conveyed and it was one sign.

 We call it interpreting instead of translating because there is no one to one correspondence most of the time, there's a range of conceptually accurate ways to change what was spoken into the same notion in sign, and vice versa.

To understand why signed languages aren't universal, you only need to get one hearing friend in some other part of the world and tell them to video tape themselves coming up with signs to express, like, ten simple sentences. You do the same, then exchange videos. Try to figure out what your friend meant, and have them guess your meaning before sharing.

Nouns, verbs, adjectives. You name it. I should also mention that facial expression and other NMM (non-manual markers) are a huge part of signed languages. They can negate a statement, can indicate the subject or topic versus the comment about it, indicate statements versus questions, yes/no questions vs who/what/where/when/why questions...

Just like in America we use the middle finger and in the British Isles they use the two finger thrust, in Italy, the ringing fist, in, I think Greece the captured thumb... these signs are commonly known by the hearing culture, but they aren't universal by any means. The concept is universal-the gesture is not.

Deaf people live geographically separated from each other. They never had a world wide counsel meeting to decide on what signs and facial expressions to use, and they can't telepathically communicate. Languages develop by use and expand based on the need to relay new kinds of information. There are definitely some similarities, and there are definitely some hand shapes and signs that are shared by different languages for the same meaning, but it's about as common as you find in spoken languages with the same roots. In Spanish raro means strange, and something rare *is* unusual or strange. Fumar means to smoke, and we have words like fume and fumigate. Similarities, and sometimes the same ancient roots, but it doesn't mean that anyone who speaks English will have an instant command of Spanish.

I hope any of this was interesting or enlightening, if you have more questions I'll try to answer. Time to go to second work.

"The Japanese fishermen were actually 40 miles outside the danger zone, but the nuke was much stronger than the US had anticipated. 

&gt; The sky in the west lit up like a sunrise. Eight minutes later the sound of the explosion arrived, with fallout several hours later. The fallout, fine white flaky dust of calcined coral had absorbed highly radioactive fission products, and fell on the ship for three hours. The fishermen scooped it into bags with their bare hands. The dust stuck to surfaces, bodies and hair; after the radiation sickness symptoms appeared, the fishermen called it shi no hai (死の灰?, death ash). The US government refused to disclose its composition due to ""national security"", as the isotopic ratios, namely a percentage of uranium-237, could reveal the nature of the bomb. Lewis Strauss, the head of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, issued a series of denials; he went so far as to claim the lesions on the fishermen's bodies were not caused by radiation but by chemical action of the calcined coral, that they were inside the danger zone (while they were 40 miles away), and told President Eisenhower's press secretary that the Lucky Dragon #5 was a ""Red spy outfit"", commanded by a Soviet agent intentionally exposing the ship's crew and catch to embarrass the USA and gain intelligence on the test.[3] He also denied the extent of contamination of the fish caught by Daigo Fukuryu Maru and other ships. The FDA however imposed rigid restrictions on tuna imports.[4] The United States dispatched two medical scientists to Japan to limit the public disclosure and study the effects of fallout on the ship's crew, under the pretense of helping with their treatment.[5][6]

If you can find an example of a problem that Australia faces that isn't caused by an individual or corporation's attempts at a bigger profit margin, then please, be my guest. But you're not Australian, so this is a bit of an unfair ask.

The only one that comes to mind that isn't directly caused by power/wealth inequality is our atrocious treatment of immigrants and Aboriginals, which comes from a rather shameful streak of cultural xenophobia. ",2

When you look at just what Hoover and FBI did when he spied on people like Martin Luther King and others, it's terrifying to think of the abuse of power this new spying could bring about.  You don't have to look to the Soviets, or Nazis as examples of why this is wrong.  You can look to America's own history and see it.  ",1

I believe that an military engagement with Syria is inevitable due to the goals of the current US administration (the end goal being Iran) but the added influence of Russia is what makes this particularly interesting.  Russia has quietly built up its military strength to a position that they could effectively be a force in the area.  I think there are longer positions of strategy here than we are seeing but if a war is engaged with Syria by the US and its allies, more than anything, Russia will probably strike as well.  That circle of escalations at that point will put us in a dire situation.  We will be in WW3 though it may be conventional at first.

Your question was whether I thought not dropping bombs would bring bad PR.  Lets take a look at Libya.

Our only real ally in the Middle East is pissed at us lately because we won't support them going to war with Iran or Syria. Foreign relations with Israel have declined greatly due to that.  The US was against Israel bombing Iran during the entire nuclear issue.  And lets be honest, Israel could have wiped them off the map if they wanted, at the time.  Lately, we get this: 

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/world/middleeast/mideast-chaos-grows-as-us-focuses-on-israel.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0

So yes, doing nothing can hurt us.

But lets be honest.  We go to war (or don't) to meet our own needs.  Every country out there does.  We push political situations or global economies for our benefit.  And please don't simply be someone that thinks we can all just get along and everyone benefits.  We are a world that fights for resources and allies.  That hasn't changes since the dawn of man, it isn't likely going to change today.  We don't want our people living in poverty, the same as any other government.

The idea is that the government has to prove they are a criminal/dangerous terrorist/a member of a foreign military before taking a specific action against the person. However, due process is an amorphous term (this is the part not lawyers have a hard time with). There isn't one definition of due process and different things require different levels of it. In some instances, due process can be satisfied without a judge and that is what the executive branch is arguing they are doing. The executive branch is essentially arguing their policies and procedures afford the targets enough due process to satisfy the constitution. The academics arguing against them disagree and want some greater form of due process, but this is really an academic disagreement with no clear correct side in terms of the law. ",1

"The more bombastic NK becomes as a deterant, the more China distances itself, the more bombastic NK has to become, and on and on. The question is, if there is a war, whether China will do any military heavy lifting and take the lead on rebuilding the region after the regime is ousted. They know by now that the NK regime is unsustainable, but they don't want a unified Korea under the South's model, and they *definitely* don't want their buffer state replaced by American and ROK military bases. Not only that, but they don't want NK refugees flooding over THEIR borders. 

China taking a lead would be easier for the US than putting itself into another messy war while it has Iran to worry about. We might see China take its first steps into real imperialism. Unfortunately, that would mean no unified Korea. This is really a lose-lose for the US; if NATO and ROK take the lead, the US is in another expensive war which Iran could take advantage of. If it lets China into the big-boy's club and decides China should depose Kim, then it loses a unified, allied Korea and gives China an excuse to jack up military spending and sets a precedent for Chinese nation-building and political imperialism in the US style.

From another perspective:  Take for example a country like Bulgaria.  Let's say you sell your business for 5 million dollars.  You can't just put that in a Bulgarian bank in your name.  A clerk is going to look it up and tell the mob who is going to kidnap your daughter.

And just because the US is half redneck country doesn't make it ONE IOTA better: ""but the other kids were throwing mud, too!"" - that's simply not an argument, Russians are far more educated than US americans, you're the country of Solshenitzin and Dostoiewski etc., so don't give me that bullcrap.

"Well, there is also the *Encyclopædia Iranica* article on the subject:

&gt;[In origin, Motʿa was a pre-Islamic Arab custom. According to a number of traditions, the second caliph, ʿOmar (r. 634-44), outlawed the custom of motʿa marriage, regarding it as a form of fornication, thus implying that its practitioners could face stoning. [...] In its original form, motʿa was an Arab custom of “temporary alliance” between a woman and a man, often a stranger who was seeking the protection of her tribe. He would receive a “spear and a tent” as means of incorporating him into the group through political and affinal ties (Smith, 1903, p. 35). Because the woman lived among her own tribe, she maintained close ties with her kin and continued to enjoy their support. Children born of such unions traced descent through their mother’s lineage and would remain with her tribe, regardless of the father’s continued residency among his wife’s tribesmen (ibid.).
Rules and procedures regarding motʿa developed piecemeal during the period of transition following the advent of Islam. It was gradually conceptualized and given legal boundaries that defined it within the framework of a contract of lease and in relation to permanent and slave forms of marriage (Schacht, p. 419).](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mota)",1

"It's worth reading both sides before forming a final opinion. Both sides are obviously biased, but Top Gear's response does contain some valid rebuttals: http://transmission.blogs.topgear.com/2011/04/02/tesla-vs-top-gear-andy-wilman-on-our-current-legal-action/

Edited to add: Tesla also sued, and lost, over this. 

&gt;In a judgment handed down today Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled that Tesla’s amendment was “not capable of being defamatory at all, or, if it is, it is not capable of being a sufficiently serious defamatory meaning to constitute a real and substantial tort”. He also said that “as any reasonable motorist knows, a manufacturer’s statement about the range of a motor vehicle is always qualified by a statement as to the driving conditions under which that range may be expected. For example, one range may be given for urban driving, and another for other conditions. But such statements are rarely if ever given to the public by reference to racing on a test track”. The application to amend was therefore dismissed.

&gt;In its claim for malicious falsehood, Tesla had alleged that the Top Gear review contained deliberately false statements about the performance of the car. Mr Justice Tugendhat said that Tesla’s second attempt to formulate their malicious falsehood case on damage was so “vague” and so “gravely deficient” that “it is impossible to say that it has a real prospect of success or is in respect of a real and substantial tort.” Accordingly, that too was thrown out.

I didn't realize that having access to non-violent avenues of rape fantasies made us LESS rape-oriented.  Ok, got it.  It isn't a stupid response at all.

&gt;fraternities because they suffer repercussions 

Nope.  Because we have a culture that talks about it like its a joke.  Like those prisons you forgot to mention conveniently enough to your really shitty point.

&gt;Rape so reprehensible AND so easy to prove beyond doubt, that the rapers are found and sent to prison immediately, and the victims have 100% support.

I thought I saw where you went with this and realized....wait a second.  You think that because we jail rapists that we are better.  That is the standard.  But that is the point.  That is not the standard.  Look at what our society is doing to human dignity.  You look for demons where it is convenient to your culture.  If the only standard is ""hey, we at least TRY to jail this particular rapist right here in front of us that we have labeled one and not the thousands of others who operate in another way"" then sure, we look far better.  But our society is actually really shitty about destroying human dignity in far worse ways than really any other culture on the face of the earth.  We do not only rape in convenient ways, we destroy women (and men), make them just as ashamed of their natural body, force them into hating themselves and consuming more so that we can enjoy prosperity.  If you think you are any different, then you prove the point.

Fuck your crap about edgy nihilism.  It's just another way to arbitrarily dismiss me.  Oddly relevant.

- Villages align themselves with whoever has the most guns

Islam needs the same thing as Christianity had a few hundred years ago - a reformation, otherwise the war the West is waging on Islam is never going to stop (I know it's a war on Terrorism, but there's been several decent documentaries detailing what JSOC has been doing in at least 75 different countries with Muslim leaders).

Problem is that, as the recent US election has shown, moving away from the centre ground to try to hang onto activists adopting more extreme positions is a losing electoral strategy.  The Conservatives have also succeeded in uniting the opposition Labour party and the junior party in the governing coalition - the Liberal Democrats - both of which oppose this move.  ",3

"&gt; There is a difference.. That's the point. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 gave same-sex couples the rights and responsibilities similar to those in a civil marriage but it's not even civil marriage, it's not recognized as such in other countries and does not have all same legal rights. |

This bill is going to allow same sex couples to marry civilly. The stipulation is that religious institutions are not obligated by law to perform them. It is relevant because right now , religious institutes cannot refuse to marry a couple as long as one of them is a member of the parish. They can be non-practicing or otherwise and demand a priest marry them. This stipulation prevents same sex couples from demanding a church give them a religious marriage , and marry them in/with a religious ceremony.

This is about religious freedom. The Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church have a right to refuse to marry someone under their religion , and with the blessing of their religious sovereign. 

&gt; What about individual churches and priest around the country, can't they decide for themselves if they would like to marry same-sex couples? |

They can perform the marriage if they want. Its up to them.

But most of the replies I have gotten completely fail to understand this.

&gt; civil partnership ceremonies are banned from including religious readings, music or symbols and forbidden for them to take place in religious venues, regardless of the views of the building's owners. In Scotland, which has its own legislation, some church parishes offer blessing ceremonies for same-sex couples. |

If a church chooses to endorse and sanction the marriage , a same sex couple will be able to have it in a church itself if they want. That is part of the bill. But as you know that probably wont happen as it is against most branches of the churches beliefs. 

Which begs the question ; Why does a same sex couple want their marriage sanctioned by the Catholic church? Why do they want religious music or symbols? 


State and Religion are kept separate for a reason. The state has no right to tell the church what it should believe and what it shouldn't. The last time the ""State"" tried that in England, the people overthrew the King. And when monarchy was finally restored , it was with a huge loss of power. The state isn't going to make ideological demands here. ",1

**Details for child support calculation** 

This is for Canada. I don't know about all other countries, though from my discussions with researchers on the topic it is similar in other countries.

So [here](http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/pi/fcy-fea/lib-bib/rep-rap/1997/1997_1/1997_1.pdf) is the formula for how the Canadian Child Support tables are calculated. Here is basically how it works:

1. The primary principle is to equalize the standard of living of the two households of the parents so that one cannot ""buy the love"" of the child with lavish gifts while the other lives in poverty.
2. It uses the Statistics Canada 40/30 Equivalency Scale for defining standard of living. This scale attempts to normalize economies of size.
That is, using a single person as a baseline, how much more income does a household need to have an equivalent standard of living if there is an second person in the house. It isn't double since you don't need twice the size of house, twice as many TVs, etc. But it is more than 1. StatsCan uses 40% more for the second person and 30% more for every additional person (1.0, 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, etc.).
3. The child support is calculated by setting equal the standard of living: (income - tax - child support)/1.0 = (income - tax + child support)/1.4, where the left is the payer and the right is the primary caregiving parent. (If it is two kids it is 1.7, three is 2.0, etc.).
4. The recipient's income is then assumed to be equal to the payer's, so you directly solve the above equation for child support from the payer's income (and standard income tax without deductions). That's how the tables are made.

**Problems** 

There are all sorts of problems with this approach. Let's assume that even equalizing the households is a good principle, which I'm sure a lot of people would disagree. Even following that, here are a few issues:

- It assumes the payer has no other costs associated with the child. That is, they never see them, don't have a room for them, don't buy gifts, no travel costs, etc. The recipient has the 40% costs associated with their house and nothing associated with the payer's house. 
- The principle of neither parent being able to ""buy love"" is violated. The expenses of the recipient are *all* assumed to be 40% higher: 40% more savings, 40% more spent on gifts, 40% more on travel, 40% better car, etc. The 40% more costs of living makes sense, but the 40/30 scale doesn't differentiate between costs of living and luxuries, or savings. 
- The 40/30 scale is a statistical trending metric and is not intended as a direct measure of the circumstances of any individual household. The StatsCan [report on this scal](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/13f0019x/13f0019x1997000-eng.pdf) (p.10) claims ""keeping with the principle of simplicity and conspicuouslyarbitrary choices, each additional adult
isassumed to increase the family's 'needs' by 40% of
the'needs' of the first adult, and each child's 'needs'
areassumed to be 30% of that of the first adult. Other
valuescould just as easily have been chosen (in the
academicliterature these are known as 'equivalence
scales').The values of 40% and 30% seemed to be in
thegeneral range of most other estimates.""
- The use of the payer's income in place of the recipient's has no justification other than simplicity.
- The calculation assumes no other relationships contributing or costing either households.
- Child care costs including daycare, home care, sporting and other costs, are made *in addition to* this payment even though such costs are effectively assumed in the 40% costs of the added child.
- Spousal support is a separate and additional calculation as well, negating the whole principle of equalizing households for the sake of the child.

In short, child support payments have nothing to do with the needs of the child and screw up the whole principle upon which it actually is based, that of equalizing both parent's ability to spend money on the child.

There isn't a front line or a rear when you are a guerrilla fighter. The other option is to constantly haul an unwilling or uncooperative prisoner around with you which for obvious reasons is incredibly dangerous this person escapes or makes noise when you are mostly outnumbered and outgunned in a straight up fight. I seriously think a brave woman like Wake wouldn't list this act as one of her proudest moments but an instance of where the difficult choice was left to her to act. 

I think there was a similar instance of a Navy Seal Team who stumbled upon a farmer in Afghanistan and couldn't decide what to do with him since they were operating deep in enemy territory. They let him go and he promptly warned the Taliban who arrived and killed most of the Seal Team.

If you are really so disturbed by the idea of people being enslaved just because they were black then why do you not have similar sympathy for people who grew up in areas where there was only one industry left for them to work in, and it happened to be the one the government made illegal? This point had been made clear in countless articles, books, and documentaries about the drug war: if you live in one of these neighborhoods selling drugs is a completely logical decision and probably your best bet at feeding yourself. The fact that you completely ignore the role of the drug war in incarcerating black people and then demonize people who have been sent to jail (all while pretending you have so much sympathy for their slave ancestors) implies that you don't understand the historical and present role of the prison system in America.

Are there people in prison who have done horrible things? Of course. Should that keep us from speaking critically about the role prison plays in society? Absolutely not.

"&gt;Out of the blue in 2013 to force a war for no apparent rational reason whatsoever on a peaceful country? It can only be a joke... At least that's what one would hope.

For whatever reason, the MSM is wanting to create a distraction from this, just like they did Iran in the summer. 

I wouldn't be surprised if more things are happening in a positive sense than what is being reported by the Media. There may be some large systematic changes coming.

One thing that I find is being glossed over a bit is that SK and the US have been holding military exercises right across the street (figuratively) from NK for the last 2 months. The US is free to shoot missiles for 'testing' all they want, even when it's not near their own country, but yet if NK wants to test a missile on their own land, we have to intervene it as an act of war?

If he goes to and is allowed to stay in China, never to return to the US, and provides them with his top secret knowledge, then he defected by any definition of the word. The diplomatic state between the countries is irrelevent. Like I said, we were never in an official state of war with the USSR or the rest of the Eastern Bloc, hence the 'cold' part of Cold War, but many people defected in both directions during the cold war. Google definitions of 'defect,' none of the top hits say anything about requiring being at war.

But they are in essence making us do all the physical work and carry the moral burden for them.

I have another theory as well. Is it not possible that Al-Qaueda is deliberately trying to exaggerate the number of civilian deaths in order to try and get America to stop them? Perhaps drone strikes are a genuinely effective weapon against them and they are playing up civilian deaths to try and get the US to stop them? I do not claim this is the truth or anything, but it is mightily convenient for Al-Qaueda to claim that there are loads of civilian deaths from them.",-3

You cannot use your speech to knowingly cause harm, like yelling ""Fire!"" In a crowded building, or to knowingly defraud someone.  You cannot just say what you want when you want it at government meetings or during court proceedings.  There are a LOT of good reasons to restrict speech, and other countries have just drawn the line a TINY bit further back than ours.

"As I said above, the Vatican, like many great churches, dates to the late Middle Ages / early Renaissance. A cathedral was actually one of the best investments a medieval town could make. Despite their great expense, a large cathedral could take hundreds of years to complete. It could become an industry unto itself. Large cathedrals employed thousands, and generated huge amounts of highly skilled jobs... jobs that were sorely lacking in the period. When the cathedral was complete, they would still need to be maintained, so many workmen would still remain. The pilgrims that would come to visit the cathedral needed to be fed, clothed, and housed, and this provided a virtual tourism industry, bringing in much needed revenue to both the church and the community. Churches were also the *only* medieval centers of learning, and every major university in Europe split off from a cathedral. If you had a cathedral school in your town, opportunities for trade would skyrocket, since learning about math, geography, cartography, astronomy, business, and law was all required by merchants. Further, most towns only even needed to have one large church, since there were no denominations. Everyone was Catholic, so all the effort could go into one splendid building rather than many smaller ones. Almost all medieval cities with a cathedral were FAR better off than their counterparts without them. This is why the cathedral is often called the greatest innovation of the Middle Ages. ",11

"Integration and assimilation are two entirely different things.  Integration is not at odds with multiculturalism at all.  Assimilation I agree though, is at odds with multiculturalism.

There are certain cultural practices that we rightfully don't accept...you might have to leave those at home to integrate properly into our western society.  

Basically...integration is the full acceptance that though an immigrant has the same rights within a society as a natural born citizen does, they also have the same responsibilities of living within the framework of laws and civil society that we've developed (and continue developing).

If it were really strong evidence, I would expect a lot more yes votes and Congress telling us there is very strong evidence, and if you knew it you would vote yes too. But that isn't what happened. The evidence the rest of the world was enough to cause Britain to vote against it's leader for the first time in a very very long time in terms of attacking. Obama's evidence is supposed to be proof and has left even our own Congress unconvinced, so I imagine it isn't much better. The rebels have gas masks and rockets just as Assad's regime.

"Yes, that's why Microsoft and Google encrypt the emails on their servers and why Prism which gives them direct access to those encrypted mail messages (presumably they've received access to the decryption ""key"") invades the privacy of those communications. 

I'm by no means an expert sysadmin and I don't claim to have any background in security. Yet, I don't think the conclusions I draw in the following paragraphs are unreasonable--again, my opinion. If I'm wrong call me out on it.

Presumably, with the algorithms available to the federal government they likely have efficient ways to read and intercept mail messages without needing direct access. There's not much that can prevent that. If there is a specific person they're targeting and they have an ip address, it's not too difficult to intercept or even hack into their personal account. But snail mail has similar problems. It is not impossible to intercept mail parcels sent by people. Yet, people expect their mail to be private even though it could looked at as well and we have seen cases like in the 50s where it was done. Despite those facts, the reason we expect privacy in mail communication is because it's unfeasible to search though every mail parcel for certain keywords or names. The sheer manpower required would make the task astronomical, not to mention the expense. Yet, with the iteration of memory storage and computation speed that can handle vast amounts of data the opposite is true for electronic mail and communications. Everything is available and they don't even have to know where to look. When the government has a database of messages, emails, texts, and profiles that they can search and sort at their own discretion suddenly, it becomes much easier to find keywords and phrases to watch and build a profile on certain individuals. 

The scope of this program is albeit limited at this point. Giving the government the benefit of the doubt, maybe they are only using these databases to route out ""terrorists"" and ""terrorist activities"". Fair enough. The argument on the merits of that are generally ideological and pointless to have on Reddit. My issue is, (and here's where I'm basing this solely out of knowing that the US government has a bad record historically of abusing tools like wiretapping) I think this will be used for nefarious purposes. I think its capabilities and interests will broaden and although most of the internet isn't private per se having a database means the government can find exactly what they want even if they don't know where to look.

And this is only going to get worse. Cloud computing is being pushed *very* hard by the big three (Google, Microsoft, and Apple) and it won't be long before Google Drive, Skydrive, Microsoft Azure (Sharepoint), and iCloud are integrated into most aspects of our life. The conveniences that these technologies provide come with the cost of giving this information (which can be confidential company information or private documents) directly for the government to add to their database. And if someday down the line the government needs dirt on a certain individual, needs information about the confidential going-ons of a company, or wants to discover the location of an activist that is causing too much trouble (phone metadata) it's right there at their fingertips.",3

"&gt;Stewart Baker, a one-time general counsel for the NSA and a top Homeland Security official in the Bush administration, said that the idea of using potentially embarrassing information to undermine targets is a sound one. ""If people are engaged in trying to recruit folks to kill Americans and we can discredit them, we ought to,"" said Baker. ""On the whole, it's fairer and maybe more humane"" than bombing a target, he said, describing the tactic as ""dropping the truth on them.""

Specifically, you always shoot center mass.  Always.  Despite the movies, if you're shooting a gun at a person, you intend for them to die.  The reasoning is twofold: first, your accuracy is limited at any range, so you're far less likely to hit an arm or a leg, and second (related to the first) is that your number one priority is NOT hitting anyone else, be they behind the target or through several walls, so you aim center mass.",24

"By ending the Nirth-South divide do you mean unification? Because that certainly wouldn't be to South Korea's benefit. 

As for nuclear weapons, the American media is far more concerned about that than any Korean is. North Korea is not a nuclear threat to anyone. 

What she really needs to do is to start using her country's wealth to try and make the lives of the citizens better. Better childcare, better social welfare, shorter working hours, less sexual discrimination, curtailment of the hagwon system and so on. 

**Edit: Lots of downvotes so let me elaborate.**

I live in Korea - have done for years - I speak Korean, live with Koreans, work in a Korean company where all of my colleagues are Korean, I read Korean newspapers and watch the Korean news and I... help my landlady take out her garbage.

The average South Korean is definitely *not* particularly worried that they're going to be nuked by NK, and neither should they be. 

As South Korea's former ambassador to the Six Party Talks told me in person (I wrote a paper about NK's negotiating strategy and goals in the SPT, using Korean sources instead of the usual Zach Snyder and such), North Korea doesn't actually have any nuclear weapons in the truest sense of the word. In his own words, what they have are malfunctioning nuclear devices. Weapons can be controlled, manipulated, targeted and so on. What North Korea has can't be. 

While they may have nuclear technology, it's far behind the other nuclear-armed states. But it's not only the quality of their nuclear devices that's inferior, it's also the quantity. The US has literally thousands of nuclear weapons, as does Russia. The other nuclear powers have hundreds each, even countries like India and Pakistan probably have around 100. If you ask experts on NK's nuclear weapons programme, you'll find that they are believed to only have five, possibly as many as eight or nine if they've really pulled the wool over everyone's eyes.

Compared to the rest of the world, the truth is that they're not a threat. They could be wiped out in a day if the rest of the world wanted to. They wouldn't get a chance to launch any sort of massively successful attack, let alone a nuclear one, which as we've seen they haven't even be able to test to any sort of attack capabilities.

But the western media, and the American media most of all, doesn't want us to see this side of it. They don't want us to see that North Koreans actually have access to plenty of South Korean DVDs, that a number much bigger than you may expect are allowed to travel to China, that tourists can take cameras into the country and take photos, that the people don't all think their country is the richest, most powerful in the world. 

It's our responsibility when presented with any ""news"" or information that we think critically about it. What's the source? who's presenting it to us? But for some reason when it comes to North Korea, too many people seem to forget all this and are far too willing to believe even the most sensational reporting.

Anyways, as for ""ending nuclear sanity across the planet"" by ending the North/South divide, as you claimed, I think it's clear that this notion is ridiculous. Partially for the reasons I mentioned above - those in the know are well aware that there's no real nuclear threat - and also because unification would be hugely detrimental to South Korea, and arguably not that beneficial for current North Koreans either. It's far better for everyone for North Korea to continue to loosen up, to gain more and more knowledge of the outside world and to become more like the rest of the world on their own, with the support of other nations where possible.",-6

"&gt; you can also miss with a gun, the person attacking you may not. Firing any projectile weapon is difficult regardless of it being a taser or not.

The point was that a projectile taser is a single shot weapon, and a modern firearm is not.  Anyone with a modicum of training will be able to hit a target within a few shots, especially after the initial shock wears off and they begin to act.  A projectile taser is useless at that point, a firearm is still 100% effective.

&gt; Criminals are always prepared for the confrontation so that will always be up against you regardless. If they are also grappling with you the best chance you have with a gun is to hope they don't get ahold of it too.

This is a popular misconception about firearms at close distances, perpetuated by TV, movies, and charlatan martial arts instructors.  A defensive shooter with a minimum of training knows how to keep a gun away from an attacker, because there are shooting positions designed to allow you to shoot at a target while keeping the gun under control... the so called ""shooting from retention"".  If you were to try to wrestle the gun away from my 110lb girlfriend you would not be able to do so before she shot you several times in the chest.

You can't do that with a taser because the taser requires contact to work, so you have to put it out there where it can be grabbed.

&gt; Granted shooting someone with a gun at close range is going to do more damage than a taser at closer range (with thick clothes) but again killing someone should never be the answer (I get that you'll consider that to not be living in the real world).

At the point where a person's life is legitimately threatened by an aggressor, I do not have a moral objection with the  aggressor also facing the possibility of death.  You and I simply do not see eye-to-eye on this issue.

&gt; We should remove military from this next paragraph as you and I are not in a warzone so saying that just because the military aren't running around with tasers meant they're not good defensive weapons is a non point. They work in different circumstances to one you and I live in.

Fair enough, though I was thinking of MPs specifically.

&gt; The police in the UK don't have guns but they do have tasers. However when they are in danger they rarely use tasers, they use batons, not because tasers are less effective but because it's overkill.

The police in the UK are using their batons because they're more effective than the taser.  The taser isn't overkill, if anything it's likely to do less permanent damage than the baton.  If you've ever seen what blunt force trauma can do, you'd agree with me.

The tasers are simply less effective than the baton.  They have one shot, easy to miss on a moving attacker, and then they're contact weapons, but have less reach than the baton and are more affected by heavy clothes.

&gt; They aren't used in the US because a gun is an easier (but more extreme) way to get someone to comply and the threat of a criminal with a gun is much higher than the UK.

They *are* used in the US, and usually when a suspect is being wrestled to the ground and resisting arrest.  They make the suspect ""comply"" by zapping him with the taser until he stops struggling.  Their claim is that it will cause less permanent injuries than five officers using elbows and knees to manhandle a suspect into compliance.

Pointing a gun at a person doesn't make him comply unless he thinks you're going to shoot him.  An officer cannot legally just shoot a person because he's not putting his hands behind his back or laying still on the ground.  That makes a gun a pretty lousy ""compliance"" weapon in the US.

&gt; However the police are highly trained individuals who operate in a completely different world to you and I. Their work requires that they have these tools avaliable because they're far more likely to have to actually use the gun or have a gun pointed at them, it's the world they operate in.

I take issue with that.

The police have more training that an average citizen, but spread out over a great deal of things.  Defensive shooting, on the other hand, is something they're notoriously poor at.  Here in the US they have a notoriety for excessive force, hitting bystanders, and generally piss poor marksmanship. Most of them only have to qualify at a laughable distance against a paper target once per year, and never shoot any more than that.

Furthermore, while an officer is likely to encounter *more* threats to his being, I wouldn't argue that they're greater threats, or that they're fundamentally different and therefore less dangerous.  Additionally, a police officer is likely to (1) always have backup a few minutes away (seriously, nothing brings a speedy police response faster than a call for backup from another officer), and (2) preemptively discourage threats against his person just by nature of the fact that he's a uniformed police officer.  

Therefore I do not agree with the conclusion that a police officer should have guns while a citizen should not.

&gt; The original purpose of tasers/pepper spray is compliance yes, but why can't they be defensive too, they will also work defensively,

It's not that they can't be used defensively, it's that they're bad at it.  They require you to control the environment completely, which is fine when you're one of 10 officers trying to get a cornered, struggling suspect under control.  It's not fine when you're alone in the dark with a strong headwind and a determined and physically superior attacker.

&gt; do you not think you couldn't defend yourself with a taser? 

Honestly, no.  In all seriousness, I would carry a baseball bat around before I carried a taser.

&gt; There's too many cons to having massive gun ownership that outweigh the benefits over a taser (personally speaking)

I disagree with that, because here in the US the areas with actually massive *legal* gun ownership are pretty safe.  Even in the US, with comparatively large firearm homicide rate driven primarily by gang violence, we're still far more likely to die in a car accident than be murdered by someone with a gun (especially if we're not involved in gangs or drugs).  And despite what the media portrays, we're far more likely to be killed by lightning than die in a mass shooting.",1

Instead of another party who would confirm a missile launch as in the case of land-based ICBMs, the set of keys is distributed among the key personnel on the submarine and are kept in safes (each of these crew members has access only to his or her keys). Some keys are stored in special safes on board which are secured by combination locks.

It's apparent that it's through a mixture of apathy and powerlessness (as is the case for most individuals in this thread, myself included) but also deep historical ignorance, and in some cases war apologists and torture relativists. (thanks for your contribution)

As to the e-voting, they would need access to several voting machines in several precincts as well as a crack team of computer scientists who had a purchased or stolen machine (they don't exactly give those out to anyone). Even then, a statistical audit would catch anything too aberrant from the mean, which means you'd need to adjust even more precincts. This isn't perfect, but compared to Russia's farce of a democracy (again, threatened/killed journalists, threatened political opponents, long-term jail terms for activism, and a puppet president used to get around term limits) it's heaven.

And if we get into the long history, Russia's current government just doesn't exist for comparison (unless we want to include the USSR which didn't have a great record on human rights and outright invaded countries, slaughtering/jailing all who opposed them).",1
"We would be forced to dump capitalism (or rather the abomination we call capitalism, but is actually just a corporatocracy). The job of the government would be to keep the machines running via human labor (each person would only dedicate a few years of life. enough to learn a specific machine, and fix it for a number of years depending on how much automation we have at the time). Then the machines would supply our food, housing, transportation, road maintenance, healthcare prevention (emphasis on prophylactic treatment like good diets, treating diseases at early stages), etc. Much of this already feasible if we eliminate one obstacle: human greed.

Out fought and out thought by an enemy more ideologically and emotionally invested in the outcome, who knew exactly how much damage they needed to inflict upon their enemy to make them turn and run. By what measure were the US not defeated militarily? Because the NVA didn't invade the US afterward and destroy every piece of military equipment? Because US military technology was still vastly superior and the VC didn't play by the rules so that superiority could be utilised? The North Vietnamese did exactly what they needed to to stave off an invading force. The US were beaten tactically and spiritually. 

Your outlook upon this seems kind of biased tbh, you make it sound like the US were bravely holding their own until those pesky hippies made them withdraw. Damn those liberal Soviet sponsored lefties with all their humongous power to direct US foreign policy, it definitely wasn't influenced by the fact that hundreds of thousands of US troops were dead or wounded for what many people saw as a pointless cause. The antiwar movement was a lot more broad than just a few liberals, it was parents and relatives from all walks of life, and many soldiers too. As for the retreat itself, the fact that billions of dollars worth of equipment was abandoned hardly suggests the well ordered retreat of a force being reluctantly called away from a winning position.

Wrong vs. wrongly

Wrong and wrongly are both used as adverbs, meaning incorrectly, badly, or mistakenly. Usage authorities differ on whether using wrong this way is grammatical, but in practical usage, many writers clearly have no problem with the adverbial wrong.

The adverbial wrong always follows the verb it modifies (e.g., he answered wrong). It also follows the object of the verb if there is one (e.g., he answered the question wrong). And wrongly can go either before or after its verb (e.g., he was wrongly imprisoned by the state; the state imprisoned him wrongly).

In any case, keep in mind that some consider the adverbial wrong incorrect, so writers who wish to play it safe should stick with wrongly.

The world knows how much it cost the West Germans to bring the DDR into their country, and that was a much, MUCH better scenario than the DPRK (the DPRK has about twice the number of people, and about 1/6th the per capita income that the DDR did when it collapsed and was merged into Germany).

South Korea doesn't want to foot the bill, and would rather hope that the DPRK eventually liberalize their economy like China did, making it easier to help build them up over a longer period of time.

"Since a lot of these comments in here are based upon misleading or an incorrect understanding of how the US government finances its debt, I'll try to lend an informative perspective on how it works:

Q.  How does the US finance its debt?

A.  When government expenditures exceed government revenues (i.e. a budget deficit), the government must get the additional revenue to compensate.  They do this by the US Treasury Department.  The Treasury sells securities, such as bonds, to do this.  Anyone wanting to purchase them can do so and they're often seen as a very safe way to invest money, versus stocks which can yield a higher return at the cost of higher risk.

Bonds are essentially an IOU where the borrower (the US government) says that they will pay you the amount back at a specific period in time (known as the maturity date) plus interest (known as the coupon rate).  Interest is paid periodically once the bond is purchased and is paid until maturity.  The US makes these interest payments twice a month (the 15th and the last day of the month).

Bonds issued through the Treasury carry the ""full faith and credit backing"" of the US Federal Government.  Around the world they are widely viewed as the safest investment one can make, it is also one of the most popular investments, if you have a 401(k) and/or IRA or an investment account, chances are you own government bonds.  As such, the interest payouts on them are pretty low, riskier bonds pay a higher rate of interest due to the increased risk that the bondholder assumes.

Because of this, the government can continue to meet its financial obligations at a pretty low cost to taxpayers.

Q.  What role does the US Federal Reserve play in this?

A.  When people say that the Fed ""prints"" money, they're referring to how they behave in the Treasury securities market (although I suspect some people literally think the Fed actually prints money).  The Treasury securities market is the tool the Fed uses to implement monetary policy.  If it wants to ""print"" money, it buys these securities, injecting money into the economy and lowering interest rates (all other factors equal), this process is commonly referred to as ""monetizing the debt"".  To reduce the money supply, they do the opposite, they sell securities, taking the cash they get and remove it from circulation in the economy which, all else equal, would increase interest rates.  This is how the Fed manages inflation.

Q.  What is the debt ceiling?

A.  The debt limit is an arbitrary limit on how much money the government can actively borrow to pay **existing** legal obligations, things like social security payments, interest on existing debt, Medicaid, etc etc.  The debt limit isn't a ""blank check"" to go spend on new expenditures and programs as commonly described but rather allows the government to meet existing legal obligations.

Q.  Why do we need to increase the debt ceiling?

A.  The debt ceiling was exceeded back in May (you probably recall hearing a lot about it in the news at the time) but the US has had cash on hand to still meet it's obligations, forecasting that we'd be in trouble come October...which is now hence why it's popped back up in the news.  Cash is now running low and without having the debt ceiling increased, we'd be unable to continue to meet our obligations.  

Q.  So what happens if we can't meet our obligations?

A.  It's never happened before in the history of the United States so it'd be a really substantial thing to occur.  For starters, we'd have to withhold a range of payments. Retirees may not get their Social Security checks, particularly dangerous since millions of people rely on it as a source of income. This holds true for Medicare and Medicaid recipients. Those who hold Treasury notes (again this ranges from pensions, 401(k) and IRA holders, foreign countries and financial insitutions, etc) also could get the proverbial short end of the stick, jeopardizing the solvency of many financial institutions and slowing down global credit flows.

We'd also be unable to pay the interest on our debt which would trigger default.

Q.  What could potentially happen in the event of a default?

A.  The value of Treasury bonds and the dollar would plummet.  To try to keep bonds and other securities attractive to investors, the coupon rates would need to be increased and therefore our borrowing costs would skyrocket as anxious investors require a higher return to buy US debt, which before had the ""full backing and credit"" of the government but is now suddenly shaky. 

To exacerbate the problem, the rate on Treasuries is a benchmark for other rates, those too would skyrocket, everything from mortgages, student loans, and car loans.  As a result of the suddenly higher borrowing costs, consumption would drop as would stocks.  Not exactly a rosy picture.

So if you read all of that, thanks for reading.  I simply provided it to give a factual and hopefully simplistic way to understanding the US's financial situation and hopefully provide a catalyst for more engaging discussion.

Their argument apparently is security? But what does that mean? Preventing another 9/11? Protecting technological/economical secrets or whatever? Or could this information also be used for mass manipulation of the populace? I am not even quite sure if I can even start to grasp the extends of what in theory could be done with all this information. But do I trust a bunch of folk with their own agenda to secretly decide what can be done with my information for me? I am not okay with that. Both not practically, or ethically. 

I mean I am going to sound really naive here. Because, well I am, I know I am, I want to be, to some extend. But I wish, that just for a day, the world would stop turning, and everyone would look at themselves, and just what exactly they are doing. Who am I exactly? What I am currently doing? Is this what I want to do? Am I who I want to be? Does this benefit me? Does this benefit others? Or on the contrary, does my agenda, hurt other's agenda? Or even further, does my existence directly hurt that of another? And then, how high do I value another's existence compared to my own?

Maybe I am taking this a bit too far. But yeah, if I look around me, we live in such a competitive world. I am trying to lay my finger on it, but I cannot quite comprehend it. It's individuals everywhere being in a constant struggle to achieve whatever agenda they have set. And to me, it often seems to achieve one agenda, many others which are interwoven in it, be it contrary to that agenda, or exploitable to that agenda, or whatever, seem to suffer from it. I am speaking agendas now, but what I mean is people. It's people going over other people to achieve what they want to achieve. I am not sure if I am okay with this. Does it all come down to responsibility for oneself? Is it still all just survival of the fittest? Is there even an alternative? Because I mean, when the truly fit, the one's in power, start doing this; a lot of folk and going to suffer. As proven with this. As proven with every genocide, or other infringement of personal right ever. But how do we even take responsibility for ourselves, when our personal space is being violated without us knowing? And even if there comes an end to this, will the current model of a few leading the many not inevitably lead this reoccurring of similar situations? I mean democracy is great and all, and our needs here in the west are served better than that of many nation. Still, true democracy only truely functions when those in charge serve democracy, and nothing other than democracy. And in all honesty, I am not even sure if one can do anything other than serve him or herself. And even then, only a majority is satisfied in their wishes.

"Given the far-reaching results, it's actually worse. Residential schools killed some, but they also left the survivors, of which there were many more, ill equipped to function as adults, unable to be participants in their own culture and unable to integrate into general society, and without any capacity to be loving parents to their own kids, having never had parents themselves. There's a clear and sound link between residential school survivors and domestic issues including the propagation of abuse, to drug addiction, and to suicide and mental health problems, and these issues weren't just found in the direct survivors but also in their children. Residential schools fucked *generations* of people. Just absolutely fucked them.

Not to say dead kids isn't a bad thing, but there's an argument to be made that they were the lucky ones. The residential schools were a true atrocity along the lines of black slavery in the US, and are not recognized as such outside of those who study it.",11

"Ah, I misunderstood the point you were trying to make. I thought you were trying to demonstrate that the appeal on acquittal in the Knox case was akin to how OJ was convicted on civil charges after being acquitted of criminal charges. I think you are just trying to demonstrate how the Italian systems 3 levels of appeals (for both defense and prosecution) are in line with their notion of ""Double Jeopardy"".

I understand what the Italian system says and agree that it conforms with *their* definition of Double Jeopardy. That is fine and Italy can do whatever they want. However the Italian system does *not* conform to the U.S. Supreme Courts understanding of double jeopardy and how it pertains to the rights granted by the U.S. Constitution. Under American precedent the prosecutorial appeals system allowed by the Italian court amounts to Double Jeopardy. Because we are discussing the U.S. Government actively extraditing Amanda Knox *the only definition of double jeopardy that matters is the American one*. The U.S. government cannot legally undertake an activity that violates someones constitutional rights. In this case extraditing Knox ensures that she will be subject to Double Jeopardy (as the SCOTUS defines it) and therefore the extradition cannot/will not be approved.

To be clear, this isn't a case of American arrogance. Lots of countries do this when they feel the rights of the defendant are in danger. Many European countries (and Canada) refuse to extradite people to countries where the accused could be subject to the death penalty for the crime they have been charged with. They maintain this policy because *they* see the death penalty as a violation of human rights. It does not matter that the country in which the crime was committed does *not* see the death penalty as a violation of such rights.",2

Plus, it's not very ""unconventional"" either, which is an almost invariable constant with pseudo-militant Muslim youth being raised in western countries: the desire to ""show their worth"" by exhibiting behavior that defies the ""norm"" of their local communities, as a means to prove they've not been tainted from living in a ""kaafir"" society.

"There is significant irony in using the word ""Byzantine"" to describe the Vatican, not from inappropriateness of the word, but rather the odd historical connotations of such connection. Historically, the Byzantines and the Papacy tended to be in less than perfect relations, especially after the Great Schism in 1054, during which the Papacy and the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople mutually excommunicated each other. There were a few schisms before that event, such as the Acacian Schism in the 6th century and the Photian Schism in the 9th century, but the so called ""Great Schism"" would lead to the two churches to remain divided and gain significant divergence in character. The western church became the Roman Catholic Church, and the East, or Byzantine Church became the Orthodox Church.

They were very distinct in flavor, and disagreed in several key issues, such as the primacy of Rome, the Filioque, the Azyma, the concept of Purgatory, and a bunch of other doctrinal issues, which they could never redress to reunite the churches, even after the Second Council of Lyon or the Council of Ferrara/Florence.

Also demand side strategies cannot work. The US is already the world leader in incarceration and several states, California among them have no prison capacity remaining and little money for new beds.

Even 100% legalize strategies  might not be enough as the cartels are also quite capable of branching out into human trafficking, kidnapping, organized theft rings and many other crimes to provide income.

The best option is some means to cutting income and either a Mexican government that is not hollow or a sane, strong enough gang off vigilantes or someone capable of containing the violence. 

Also for the US baring some extraordinary reasons  the military option is off the table, it would be incredibly costly and  manpower intensive.

Also with the huge  Latino population in the US it would be  virtually impossible to keep  cartel guys with enacting atrocities here even if we walled the place off and turned into Festung Amerika  .

&gt;In other words, many people acting as if something is true does not make it true.

is that a culture that did not conform to *your* definition of ""objective morality"" would be simply wrong.  That is a rather bold argument to make, isn't it?

I don't think so, as I have not made the statement that a thing exists.  Perhaps I should re-phrase to clarify, however:

&gt;There is no **evidence** for a permanent, objective morality, only that morality a society exhibits, and that morality changes.

In other words, you made the positive statement that fundamental rights exist outside of law based on an objective morality, and I dispute that there is any evidence for an objective morality whatsoever.

Ok lets begin.

&gt; “**The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is:** execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter;”

What exactly is your point?

Let's see what it says BEFORE that.

Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that **whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.** 5:32

And you said Islam condones murder LOL

&gt; “I (Allah) will instil terror into the hearts of the unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off.”

Nice try, that's verse 8:12. Lets see what it says AFTER that.

""**This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger: If any contend against Allah and His Messenger, Allah is strict in punishment.** 8:13

let's keep going...

""**If you [disbelievers] seek the victory - the defeat has come to you. And if you desist [from hostilities], it is best for you; but if you return [to war], We will return, and never will you be availed by your [large] company at all, even if it should increase; and [that is] because Allah is with the believers.** 8:19 

The disbelievers were fighting and wanted to kill the Muslims. So it says if they stop, the Muslims won't fight them.

&gt; “Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), strike off their heads; at length; then when you have made wide Slaughter among them, carefully tie up the remaining captives”: thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: Until the war lays down its burdens.”

That's verse 47:4, Why won't you state the verse number? 

Let's see what it says AFTER that.

""**Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? Allah wiped them out. And for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof.**"" 47:10

""**And how many a city was stronger than your city [Makkah] which drove you out? We destroyed them; and there was no helper for them.** 47:13

""**So is he who is on clear evidence from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work has been made attractive and they follow their [own] desires?** 47:14

They kicked the Muslims out of their homes and then went to kill them.

--

Stop acting like you know everything. Also, I suspect you are a coward since you didn't offer the verse numbers. I expect a reply.

If it is happening so often in India, which has been _severely_ repressed for so long now in terms of social and sexual issues, then the people promulgating tradition over common sense need to be re-educated. Nation-wide campaign, every street corner, every day until the situation improves, signs and people spreading the idea that RAPE AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE NEVER OK.

What kind of father would condone his son to take sexual advantage of a girl or woman without her consent? What kind of father would punish his daughter for being taken advantage of? Clearly the traditionalist, caste-driven society that has flowered in India is not a thing of beauty, but it's what they have, right now. Change isn't going to happen overnight, but it needs to happen _rather urgently_.

The absolutely staggering thing is that when I was travelling in India during the 1980's, the same shit was happening. None of this is new at all, it's just entering the global awareness thanks to the Internet and our ability to spread news so quickly.

If there's anything I find funny about these NSA revelations is the masterful trolling Greenwald and others have been engaging in. It's just brilliant.

-James Clapper tells Congress that an NSA dragnet is a myth. 
-**Eric Snowden leaks documents showing that Clapper commited a felony by lying to Congress because massive NSA surveillance is REAL.**

-Obama and Clapper say Snowden is lying and they can't look up all of your electronic communications if they have only a personal email addy. -**Greenwald releases XKeyScore powerpoint showing that Obama and Clapper are lying again...**

-Obama says there is oversight and Americans have nothing to worry about. 
-**Washington Post releases information about thousands of privacy breaches each month at the NSA, including collecting of telecommunications from DC ""by mistake"" instead of Egypt.**

-Obama says the FISA court has complete oversight and gives the program legal cover. 
-**FISA court cheif judge admits it doesn't even know much about the program to exercise any real oversight; only knows what the Obama admin tells them...**

This is expert level trolling folks. No matter what Obama or members of his administration say, Greenwald and other publications with access to the Snowden leaks use THE NSA's OWN DOCUMENTS to show that they're doing nothing but lying through their teeth.

This is just amazing. I hope everyone else is appreciating the extent to which Obama looks like an utter and complete joke at this point.

- Ahmad Bahr, Palestinian Legislative Council acting speaker
(Sudan TV, April 13, 2007)

How are you going to spin that?

&gt;As to never supporting two states that is hilarious considering they went to the UN for member status alongside Israel, a two state solution.

They went to the UN for member status unilaterally. Nowhere did they ever indicate Palestinian support for a two-state solution. That was your assumption which has no basis in fact. They want Israel gone, that has been proven many times now.

From the Jewish Chronicle:

&gt;The majority of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank believe that armed struggle is the best method of achieving Palestinian independence, according to a new poll by the Arab World Research and Development centre in Ramallah.

Are you going to say the AWRD is unreliable? This is why you have to actually read the articles, boy.

Obviously the Palestinians weren't waging a genocidal war yet in the late 1800s, they needed to get stronger. And then in 1948 they attacked. And no Zionists were speaking of taking anyone's land in the late 1800s. 

&gt;So wait, the UN security council, just a handful of countries can make international law meanwhile the UN, the whole UN with all of the countries there, can not?

Hey don't hold it against me, I'm not the one who makes international law. [Only UNSC resolutions are ""binding"" and hold legal weight.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_resolution) However the vast majority of international law is made by treaties or common use, like the Geneva Conventions. Obviously none of those things are going to say that the West Bank is Palestinian land.

&gt;You aren't the first I've embarrassed like this and you definitely won't be the last.

Um, is your delusion just kicking in now? Because all you have done is tell obvious falsehoods and then proceeded to ignore the facts that I have presented. You haven't proved the Palestinians want peace, and you haven't proved the West Bank is Palestinian land. And then you wonder why your people never get anywhere.",2

'The rest' are what caused the blanket ban in the first place, since 'the rest' represented a majority of FGM cases.

The opposite is true for MGM.

The procedures for male circumcision that are not banned ""MGM-A"" represent the majority of the cases. Personally, I couldn't give a shit if they banned MGM with a blanket ban as well.

Stop being ignorant and accepting the facts that are thrown at you by a biased North American media. 99% Of the original Roma that came to Romania from India settled down and chose an honest lifestyle, the roma we have in France are all descendants of the 1% that didnt and came in the late 80s early 90s.
 
   And in case you haven't noticed, there is a financial crisis in Europe. Cant exactly throw money at the thousands of them. France has more social benefits than any other country except Finland and Sweden. The roma already profit from our hospitals (cant turn them away), live in our public parks (degrading government property), enjoy the food from ""Restos du Coeur"", and they STILL spend their day stealing, mugging, and begging. Dont say it aint so, because you have never been there. You have 0 expertise on the subject, so shut up and accept the facts. (Or, if you question everything like a smart person, read up on.the.fucking.subject.) We have to suffer them because people in their own country were ready to murder them after centuries of that behaviour so they came here. CENTURIES. 

Theyre in a hard situation because they CHOOSE to be. If you refuse to read up on the subject you will remain obtuse and naive, thinking that people don't just ""choose that kind of lifestyle."" It makes me sick that people choose to remain as ignorant as you. Once youve bothered to read up on the subject (or maybe gone to France, could be a could experience for you) you can come back and talk with the adults. You can shoot me a pm if thats ever the case.

And can you cite any evidence that NATO intervention wasn't a primary reason why the Kosovo war ended?

"OK, so we're all appalled by this. What are we going to do about it? So far 3317 people have up-voted this post. Have all 3317 of you written to your senators and congressperson urging official censure of the Ugandan government and withdrawal of US aid? If not, go do it now. International pressure helped to end apartheid in South Africa. It can help end the death penalty of homosexual people. Alas, I have little hope that it will end the rape of little girls, because our government has historically not really given a shit about what happens to women in other countries because ""well, it's their culture."" But, I digress. 
Here's the text of the message I sent:

""Dear Senator XXX:
I am sure you are not unaware of the new law passed in Uganda that makes homosexuality punishable by death. I attach an article on the subject here: http://ugandaupdates.weebly.com/1/post/2013/12/kill-gays-bill-passes-sig-of-president-expected-within-30-days.html
Please note the equally (if not more) appalling statement by the Ugandan ""Minister of Integrity and Ethics"" stating that men raping girls in ""natural.""  
The United States government must make a strong stand against both of these. We cannot claim that we promote and support human rights if we do nothing. There must be public and official censure, removal of any aid to Uganda and changes in our diplomatic mission (not withdrawal, since we want to continue to have an influence there). International pressure helped to end apartheid in South Africa. It can, and should, help to repeal this abominable law and to protect women.
Sincerely,
-(catdoctor), campaign contributor and voter""",3

"The situation is stable so long as the US stays engaged in Asia. Right now Japan is non nuclear but under the US nuclear umbrella. The US Navy is also far too powerful for China to take it on. Actually it's not at all clear that the Japanese Navy is something that China could defeat.

However if the US's commitment to Asia were to decline then Japan would need to build up both nukes and its navy. There's a fair chance in this situation that China would end up tangling with Japan.

Or, more likely, with the Philippines or Vietnam. The Philippines has no navy comparable to Japan's. Vietnam's problem is that it is a long term Chinese enemy - they fought a war in 1979. Back them the US sided with China against Vietnam. So that makes Vietnam vulnerable in that it is not at all clear the US would back it in a confrontation with China. 

Actually I'd say if China were to start a war to show it was a big power - think Russo Japanese war - I'd say that Vietnam would be the most likely target, followed by the Philippines. Japan is quite a way down the list - it's got a strong navy and the US has made it clear that the US/Japan mutual defence treaty applies to all the territory 'currently administered' by Japan. Which means in practice that China would have to fight both the US and Japan in a war over the Senkakus. That's probably too much of a risk for the Chinese government.",3
"The first part there is just pedantry. I don't really care what level of power you assign to the states, I was cutting to the heart of the matter.

I agree with you that neither the United States nor China wants to fight a war over North Korea. I pointed out that alternative to demonstrate that South Korea would not initiate a war. I highly, highly doubt that the United States and China will get into a war on the Korean peninsula. It's not in anyone's interest to do so.

But that said, I don't think you're correct in your appraisal of US strength. I will assume that the war would pretty much be fought like the 1950-53 war, because all bets are off if the United States takes the MacArthur strategy and attacks China directly in the course of the war. That would be a serious escalation that would draw a lot more parties into the war. So, not gonna happen.

My phrasing above was specific: the United States could not defeat China. I don't think that the Chinese would wipe us off the peninsula and conquer South Korea, but I also doubt that the United States would be able to manage more than just a stalemate against Chinese forces. The advantage is not just proximity, it's in numbers and terrain. The Chinese could pour many more men into combat than we could, and North Korea is difficult terrain to fight over. It was a nightmare in the 1950s, it would be a nightmare in the 2010s. Yes, we're technologically superior, but we were technologically superior then, as well. There's only so much the air force and navy can do against an entrenched land force. China's capabilities are also much greater than they were in the 1950s. I don't see how the United States wins an easy victory on the Korean peninsula, or really a victory at all. I'm confident we could prevent the conquest of South Korea, but that's about it.",0

"I think the common poison ingredient is power hierarchy. In communism, it's the revolutionary ""vanguard"" party that seizes power. In capitalism, it's the oligarchy, unless it's corrupted, then it's the wealthy who rule.

I think without the authoritarian governing hierarchy, communism would be much less oppressive. Capitalism, on the other hand, requires a mitigating liberal governance to keep the market in check. Without government, it's an unbridled plutocracy. With government, it's at best a polyarchy ruled by an elite political class.

We need an economic mode of production that isn't inherently hierarchical and also doesn't require elite political governance. Communism/socialism doesn't require either, although a political elite has historically filled this power void.",24

"tl; ngr Synopsis from the wiki: What Went Wrong?: Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response is a book by Bernard Lewis released in January 2002, shortly after the September 11 terrorist attack, but written shortly before. The nucleus of this book appeared as an article published in The Atlantic Monthly in January 2002.

The book's thesis is that throughout recent history, specifically beginning with the failure of the second Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683, the Islamic world has failed to modernize or to keep pace with the Western world in a variety of respects, and that this failure has been seen by many within the Islamic world as having allowed Western powers to acquire a disastrous position of dominance over those regions.

"**THE LAW OF RETURN DOES NOT TALK ABOUT CITIZENSHIP**

&gt; Do you not understand that the only reason they would decline you is for legal reasons

I contrary to you actually studied in the civil class (Ezrahut) and I actually do know what the law of immigration says (again contrary to you). 

A person could be bared from enter the state for anything that is considered as enduring the security of the public (Health, Crime etc) , and even if a person was granted the permission it doesn't mean he will be granted citizenship. 

family members of soldier in many cases are granted an option to enter  to the state it doesn't mean they get an Israeli citizenship. 

&gt; If you are Jewish, then by law you are ENTITLED to become a citizen if you apply.

I'm not aware of such law, the quoted law doesn't say so it says that a person is has an option (the law is written in hebrew) or the right to be able to enter the state.

That it nothing about citizenship - the Israeli legal system has a distinct separation between entry to the states laws, settling (you could live in Israel with temporary or permanent residency) and citizenship. 



have you tried actually reading the law ? here I will make that easy for you [here](http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/heb/chok_hashvut.htm) it is please qoute for us where it says that any Jew wordlwide is guaranteed to have an Israeli citizenship. 

even more please show the where in that text the 

please how about you read how citizenship in Israel works,  

&gt; The law is plain and simple.

The qouted law doesn't say a person get citizenship, the law talks about the possibility of a person to recive the option to enter the state. 

have you tried actually reading the law ?!

**TL;DR** if people think that immigration laws eqaul citizenship laws I wonder if they also think that if a person got tourist visa to the states means they are citizenship or even if a person got a green card it means he got citizenship.

After the [BSE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy) (Mad Cow Disease) thing, there was a major push for tracability in the food supply. The system was supposed to allow people (and health authorities) to trace meat from farm to plate and every step inbetween. 

The end result should prevent infected beef from entering the food supply or if it has already entered, the farms, slaughterhouses, processers and butchers can be quarantined from the rest and affected consumers can be contacted.

This whole debacle shows that the entire tracability program does not work. If they can't tell if a horse is in the system, how can they tell if a cow with BSE has entered the system. And bear in mind the tainted beef was sold for an entire year before it was picked up. 

People seem to be focusing on the horse aspect of the story not the fact that we don't know what is entering our food supply. Today it's the wrong species, tomorrow it might be cattle infected with brain melting prions or some other disease.

"To see a leafed fig tree in the distance warranted the assumption that there would be fruit on the tree. But for this tree, the leaves were there, but it was fruitless. This phenomenon, therefore, served as a perfect “visual aid” for an important lesson.

Centuries earlier, the Hebrew nation had been separated from the pagan peoples of antiquity to serve in a special role. In the days of Moses, the people of “Israel” were designated as God's “firstborn” (Ex. 4:22), i.e., they were granted a priority status. God thus said to Pharoah, who held Israel captive, “let my people go” (Ex. 5:1).

Across the centuries, however, the Israelite people frequently rebelled against God despite being helped. Isaiah once characterized the situation in the following fashion. “The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master’s crib, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand” (Isa. 1:3).

While there were occasional periods of spiritual revival among the Hebrews (as in the days of Josiah, a good king – see 2 Kgs. 22-23), the nation was on a gradual, degenerative slide throughout the Old Testament — a path of apostasy that would culminate with the blood-thirsty cry, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” (Lk. 23:21). The Jewish people, through the influence they exerted upon the Roman authorities (see Mt. 20:19; Acts 2:23), had Jesus killed. They murdered the very Messiah for whom they had waited across the centuries (see Mt. 21:33ff). Though they had enjoyed every conceivable spiritual advantage as the ""firstborn"" of God, they had become, for the most part, an utterly renegade nation.

In the symbolism of the Scriptures, a fruitless, withered tree was worthy of nothing more than being cut down (cf. Psa. 90:6; Hos. 9:16). “Withering” was a symbol of imminent death (Joel 1:12). In the blasting of this fruitless fig tree, Jesus was suggesting this:

(1) The nation, as a political entity, had become a worthless mechanism in the spiritual scheme of things. It thus was worthy of nothing but destruction.

(2) That destruction would shortly come (within forty years — A.D. 66-70) with the invasion of the land by the Roman armies (cf. Mt. 22:7ff; 24:15ff).

(3) The punishment would be complete and final; the “tree” would be dead from the very “roots” (Mk. 11:20).",80

- first: there's no such thing as terrorism in Brazil. Yes, there are popular riots, but no such thing as terrorism as its known on other parts of the globe. Riots here are made by the people, and not by organized groups (criminal or not. religious or not)

- second: another thing that's being questioned is the construction techniques around here. Well, the techniques are as up to date as in any developed country, for the constructors are mostly multinational companies. The technique itself is state-of-the-art, what may (however) have compromised the outcome is political corruption leading to Project management oversight and unqualified workers (there are lots of them around here)

"**Just in case you can't access the article due to a pay wall.**

In his eleventh-hour decision against attending the funeral of Nelson Mandela, Benjamin Netanyahu proved that he is not the smug, petty, vindictive, waffling, in-your-face insulting man he seems. He's something worse.

The problem is not so much that the prime minister had first informed the South African government that he would, in fact, attend the ceremony, alongside Presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, French President Francois Hollande, and scores of other world dignitaries, among them Iranian President Hassan Rohani, in what is expected to be a world gathering unprecedented in scope.

Nor is the basic problem the fact that the decision was made so abruptly and with such lack of consultation, that the office of President Shimon Peres was thrown for a loop, and it was unclear if arrangements could be made to have Peres represent Israel in Netanyahu's stead.

The problem is the reason Netanyahu chose to give: Money. The trip would cost too much. The problem, then, is the message Netanyahu has chosen to send:

My Israel, which so craves and demands legitimacy and recognition as a full partner in the community of nations, does not consider a man like Nelson Mandela, or a nation like South Africa, or the sentiment of an entire world, worth the price of a plane flight.

In sending this message, Benjamin Netanyahu has treated the passing of Nelson Mandela as he does every challenge in statecraft: He has addressed one problem by creating another.

His message is clear: My Israel, which spends untold tens of millions on such matters as bolstering and protecting settlement construction during peace negotiations with the Palestinians, or erecting detention facilities for African asylum seekers rather than formulating coherent and just refugee policies, has nothing left over for this man Mandela.

But that's only the beginning. With a wink and a nod to the settler right, the academic rabid right, and the KKK-esque far right, Netanyahu is sending an even stronger message:

This is where I stand on this Palestinian-lover, Mandela. And this is where I stand on his Palestinian-lover heirs.

At home, the decision has been interpreted as Netanyahu's response to recent reports of profligate household spending.

Bottom line, Netanyahu seems to be suggesting: I have learned my lesson from having lavish bedrooms installed in airliners for relatively short trips, and for overspending taxpayers' money on flowers and candles and pool water for my three homes.

I will economize. No more empty frills. Like the Mandela funeral.

Worst of all, perhaps, and certainly setting a new standard in irony, Netanyahu's skipping the Mandela commemorations will allow him to oversee an extraordinary exercise in ramming through a Knesset bill to allow authorities to jail African asylum seekers for up to a year without trial, and to keep them from finding gainful employment in Israel.

Just last month, the cabinet approved a budget allocation of 440 million shekels ($126 million) to fund the provisions of the as-yet-unpassed and High Court-vulnerable bill – more than 60 times what it would have cost for Netanyahu to attend the funeral.

Never has Netanyahu sent a message quite this infuriating, with so much apparent success.

He is betting, apparently, that the moderate majority has expectations so low, its resources of outrage so overtaxed and depleted, its capacity for response so beaten flat, that it will do little more than shrug and trudge on. And this bet may well be the smart money.

What we are stuck with, in the end, is the message that Netanyahu is sending to the world. The world that Netanyahu's Israel is determined not to be a part of.

If you cannot you must admit that the evaluating humans above other species is simply egoism, and that the animal-rights activist are the only one who can claim to be compassionate and moral. 

Thirdly, if you can tell me we should consider the welfare of non-aryans comparable to our own you will have your answer.

Lastly and following the previous; if one does not accept supernatural causes of morality and ethics then they have no objective existence of value. As such the value must be derived from how much we put into it and how objectively we follow it. By creating rights that are purely subjective we destroy their objective strength and these rights can be dismissed as simply self serving interest rather than an attempt at achieving a greater good.

"No, your statements ARE batshit insane, and the certainty with which you speak them marks you as deeply, deeply delusional. 

History does not back you up, and both the Middle East and South American region's recent history is not defined by those policies. In fact, it is the very belief in the existence of those policies that is deeply ignorant and an reality-dissociated basement dweller theory, fixated on a video-game like concept of ""stability"". 

You link in your post to Venezuela as an example of _when an upgrade was sought_. But this contradicts your point - _because Venezuela was not a choice between an allied dictator and an allied democracy_.

Hugo Chavez, the person the coup sought to oust in 2002, was not an ally of the US. On your list I would call it a hostile, sham democracy. An ally he certainly was not. 

Your statement that: ""The problem with a friendly democracy is that it could turn into an unfriendly democracy during any election cycle."" in this connection **can only be interpreted as indicating that Venezuela under Hugo Chavez pre 2002 was an ally of the USA. But this is not the case**. That means your example falls flat by definition - it does not indicate that a choice of allied dictatorship was made over allied democracy.

Even in general terms, **if you support a friendly dictator because a friendly democracy is turning unfriendly, then a friendly democracy is not an option, again by definition. The option to have a friendly democracy ceases to exist when it turns unfriendly**.

Moreover, your approach is extraordinarily reductionist in that it narrows the choices down to ""stability"". 

Firstly, you assume that dictatorships are more stable than democracies. But you fail to provide a reasonable backing for this assumption. In fact, there are a great number of democracies in the world that have been allies of the US for a great many years - indicative that democracy can bring huge stability. At the same time there have been a huge number of dictatorships that have fallen in very few years. 

Since your ""theory"" rests on the fundamental assumption that dictatorships are more stable and more controlled than democracies, which I would very much disagree with and you have provided no evidence for, it falls flat for that reason alone.

Moreover, the focus on stability is extraordinarily reductionist and reality-dissociated. There are a massive number of relevant effects of democracies and dictatorships. 

For example, if a government supports a dictatorship that is an ally of itself, it loses international credibility, weakens its diplomatic position, creates points of criticism against itself and fans the flames of opposition against itself. Those are direct, negative effects of having dictatorships as allies, directly countering the ""benefits"" you believe in. 

Moreover, when the dictatorship is ousted, the population will have a great cause to be heavily opposed to the US that supported the dictatorship. This is not the case in a democracy where opinion simply changes, and is another cost that directly counters the ""benefits"" you believe in.

Moreover, dictatorships typically suffer from a huge number of social ills, that democracies do not.

Would the US benefit if all of Europe turned into dictatorships? No, it would not. It would turn those countries into the unhappy hellholes that follow the very concept of dictatorships, and heavily weaken its international power due to the corresponding weakening of its allies.

Your theory hence fails to be supported by the plainly false (Chavez), illogical and self-contradictory (to replace a friendly democracy because it will not be friendly), and extraordinarily reductionist (a narrow-minded and video game-like focus on temporary ""stability"" as be-all and end-all of international power) statements you made, and even in its first conception it ignored practically everything else than an obviously unfounded conception of ""stability""

2) The US fracking boom will turn out to only be a minor boon as wells peter out very quickly.

3) The overwhelming majority of the US military interventions in the modern era have been to improve US hegemony.

These are well supported facts to one who studies global economics, politics and hegemony.  It was pretty much a foregone conclusion that the US would make a play to dominate the middle east, since the alternative energy route wasn't taken and since the pull back within our borders route wasn't taken.

First off, your generalizations are bullshit.  I and many others have regularly taken psychedelic drugs and are completely functional in life.

Your hypothesis is clearly wrong in my case.  I also drink beer (which atcually is neurotoxic, unlike psilocybin) and I still manage to function, imagine that.

Second, if you have ANY science showing that mushrooms are neurotoxic I would love to see it!  And for the record, ""I saw a guy freak out a concert"" does not qualify as science.  I'm talking about actual peer reviewed science.

Third, all this ego death stuff sounds like something out of some 60s new age commune.  The idea that if you take mushrooms you wont be confident anymore is so stupid I wont even argue with it.

The juicy facts discovered by the journalists is that the migrant workers are forced to share small apartments in a former holiday complex. This also means that you have to share a tiny room with an unknown person for 3 months. Further there is a kind of paramilitary security in the holiday complex who has the task to intimidate the workers: They search the rooms of the workers, search pockets/bags of workers, shoo any annoying journalists away and continously observe/intimidate the workers through their presence (big muscled, shaved heads)

These security guys wear Thor Steinar clothing which is banned due to its afflitiation with nazi movments in Germany, amazon does not sell this brand for exactly this reason.

The workers were initially promised to be employed directly by amazon but then are actually employed by the labor leasing company for a lower wage. They only know of this at the very last minute. Now you could say that amazon in germany knows nothing of the practices of the subcontractors or ...

"Clearly... i was just trying to point out to other users to take your words with a grain a salt because its obvious you have agenda to keep up with.

Good luck with your BDS of Israel... here are some tips to help you on your way 

First, remove all Intel Pentium and Celeron computer processor chips from personal computers (desktops, laptops and notebooks) as these were either developed or manufactured in Israel. 

Note that the revolutionary new Ivy Bridge processor will be manufactured in Israel. Any computers running the Windows XT operating system must be turned off immediately as this was developed in Israel. All current Microsoft operating systems are not to be used as Microsoft is heavily reliant on its Israel R&amp;D centre.
 
Step 2. Any computers that still work need to have their anti-virus software and personal firewalls removed as this technology originated in Israel. The organisation’s firewall will also need to be switched off. Staff should no longer open external emails as most of these will be infected with viruses. No outgoing emails can be sent. The algorithm (code) that’s used today for sending e-mails, was made by an Israeli who worked at the Ben-Gurion University in Be’er-Sheva in 1980.
 
Step 3. Discard all mobile phones, as this technology was developed in Israel, where the first mobile phones were manufactured. Mobile chip technology from a single Israeli company has now been installed in over 100 million devices. Only top-level staff may retain mobile phones for emergency situations. However the use of SMS (Texting) is expressly forbidden as this facility was developed in Israel. No 4G devices can be used, as the chipset is Israeli.

Step 4. Turn off your voice-mail service and delete any recorded messages. Israeli companies invented the voice-mail system. If someone you do not know answers your phone-call, then hang up. Israeli call-centres and call-centre technology is in widespread operation in the UK.

Step 5. Before accepting any printed material, check that the supplier has not used the Israeli device that might have saved up to 50% of the ink used.

Step 6. At home, do not use Facebook as many in-built and add-on applications are Israeli-developed. Do not watch videos on the Internet as the platform used to upload them may be from AOL and hence from an Israeli company. Do not use the Internet to search for answers to your questions as this may involve use of an Israeli-developed search engine. Better to remain unenlightened.

Step 7. On your TV or home entertainment centre, do not use Video On Demand (VOD) to watch movies as you may inadvertently see an advert displayed usingIsraeli software. Do not purchase any games devices as these are likely to use Israeli technology.

Step 8. Do not read books using an e-book as this may contain Israeli technology. Do not use data storage as it may have been developed at Israel’s storage technology R&amp;D center.

Step 9. Do not buy an electric car as it is likely to be powered with an Israeli battery or use Israeli developed charging mats. Continue to sit in traffic knowing that you are polluting the environment and financing oil-rich despotic regimes.

Turning to food and drink, all food outlets on the organisation’s premises must dispose of cherry tomatoes, which were developed in Israel. Staff must ensure that no cherry tomatoes are included in sandwiches brought into office premises. The ban also applies to honey and any products derived from honey. Israel has developed solutions to the worldwide problem of bee-colony collapse, so that any products derived from bees might only be available now due to an Israeli invention.
Avoid drinking any of the world-recognised award-winning Israeli wines. Do not consume homemade drinks from Israeli-manufactured household drinks machines.
Avoid any fruit from South Africa or Peru as produce from these countries is being marketed with Israeli brand names.
No agricultural products from the following areas must be consumed as they use water irrigation and agricultural technology provided directly from Israel. This includes most of Africa, China, India, Indonesia (a Muslim country), Nepal and many others.
Much fruit and vegetables (including organic) imported into the UK has been enhanced using Israeli technology. This may save millions of people from starving around the world, but is not a good reason for you to eat it. To be safe, only eat fruit and vegetables that you have grown yourself using seeds that have been in your family for generations.

Part Two – Staff Health.

Destroy all personal medication. Israel’s Teva Pharmaceuticals, the largest generic drugs company in the world, will have manufactured many of your medicines.  Staff with the following illnesses will need to take specific precautions.

Cancer - do not take any form of medication or treatment. Israeli scientists have been working at the forefront of oncology for decades.
AIDS and HIV – beware; researchers at Israel’s Weizmann Institute or Hebrew University developed or improved AZT and Hypericin-based drugs; they have also developed a treatment that destroys HIV-infected cells without damaging healthy ones.
Diabetes – do not measure or inject Insulin using the devices developed by Israeli scientists.
Multiple Sclerosis – stop taking Copaxone, one of the most efficient medicines and the only non-interferon agent, as Teva developed it.  Don’t touch Laquinimodeither.
Parkinson’s – remove the Israel-pioneered brain pacemaker to stop tremors. Discontinue Levodopa, which reduces motor disturbances. Cease sessions that involve magnetic cortex stimulation.
Staff with a family history of heart disease and arteriosclerosis must not use the Israeli device for early detection of these.  Rather, wait until onset of the disease.
Epileptics – stop treatment that may have benefited from the Israeli discovery of the underlying mutant gene; also throw away the bracelet that sends out an alert when a person goes into seizure.
Staff or relatives with Age-related Macular Degeneration - remove Israeli implantsthat arrest the disease.
Liver disease – abandon Israeli-developed antibody immunotherapy treatments.
Emphysema - steer clear of the Israeli protein replacement therapy.
Myeloma – stop taking the drug Velcade, which was developed over a period of 30 years by scientists at Haifa.
Sleep apnea - no tests using the breakthrough Israeli device for diagnosis.
Dyslexics must not benefit from the Israeli Internet-based reading system.
Skin allergies must be treated with steroid creams only, as the new safer non-steroid alternative is Israeli.
Any incident of stroke or head trauma or onset of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MS, epilepsy, glaucoma or brain tumor must avoid using any of the Weizmann Institute’s patented methods of treatment.
Before any surgery or medical tests, check that hospital catheters have not been protected from infection using the new plastic from Israel that disables microorganisms. Avoid throat surgery as this may utilize Israeli surgical lasers.
Ensure any colonoscopy or gastro investigation does not use internal Israeli cameras such as the Pillcam.  Never undergo surgery to install an artificial heart, as the first artificial heart transplant took place in Israel.
Kidney transplant patients must wait for donors of the same blood group as only Israel’s revolutionary new methods allow donors from other blood groups.  Staff of Arab origin must not make use of the only database for matching potential Arab donors of bone-marrow - in Israel.
In the event of a spinal injury or disease, do not accept spinal implants - likely to be an Israeli product or development. Heart rhythm problems must not be solved with the Israeli-developed heart pulse generator. All heart stents are off-limits as most of these originate from Israeli medical companies.
Check all vaccines as many of these have been developed in Israel.  Ensure that all X-rays do carry a radiation risk, as the only radiation-free system is Israeli. Treatments derived from Stem Cell research must be avoided as most of theseare Israeli-developed.
If you or your family are struck with a bacterial infection, do not take alternatives to older, ineffective bacteria-resistant antibiotics, as an Israeli discovery will have been responsible for the modern, effective drugs. Check that any pain relief medication is not based on soya as an Israeli doctor discovered the beneficial effect of the soya bean.
Do not use the revolutionary new Israeli bandage that saved the life of Arizona senator Gabriella Giffords after she was shot in the head.  If you break a bone badly, reject any treatment that involves introducing collagen, as this may have been manufactured from Israeli plants.
Do not protect babies and infants from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome with the Babysense system from Israel.
Do not use Epilady (or epilator) – two Israelis invented this hair removal device.
Finally, reject all major dental treatment, as your teeth may need to be scanned with an Israeli-developed dental scanner.

"  If this wall was the only thing protecting Israelis from violent attacks why have so many settlers gone beyond this protection and deeper and deeper into Palestinian land? My opinion, peace is not a concern of Israeli settlers occupying Palestinian land. They (extremist settlers/ Government officials) wish to have a state as their holy book says it should be with no Palestinian residents. If they are safe occupying deep into Palestinian land why should they ask for peace, they have nothing to gain and much to lose making peace with the Palestinians.
  Israel could pull all it's residents out in a week if it really wanted to and it could build a relationship that consists of military cooperation to fight extremists rather than occupation that only grows Israeli extremism/expansionism and gives Arab extremist a reason to keep fighting. Or Israel could give up its unrealistic goal of a ""all Jewish state"" and make all Palestinian residents Israeli citizens with equal rights and put all the land under one state. As we all know Israeli's occupation of Palestine is illegal and the Palestinians have never had a strong leadership that could lead the way to progression. So instead the cycle of oppression and violence continues. It is up to Israel to lead the way to peace because it is there actions that will speak the loudest in the eyes of the Palestinians who have lost everything to the Israeli occupation.
  Lastly I would like to say Israeli is occupying Palestine not the other way around, typically when a country is illegally settling land against international law it is not the people whos houses are getting bulldozed and their land and rights taken away that is in position to make a peace offer or even negotiate. Being that peace between Israeli and Palestine would mean a loss of land and resources for Israel without making Israel any safer than it already is (pretty damn safe in reality) I'm not holding my breath that a peace deal will ever be made.",1

"&gt;The eugenics that was practiced in the early 20th century was hardly scientific. It was basically a pseudoscientific veneer that was painted over a desire to eliminate ""undesirable"" populations or traits, usually without any understanding of the genetic basis for those traits or a clear benefit to anyone. It was a tool of oppression and ethnic cleansing and little more.

Balderdash. At the time, it **was** science. Just because standards have improved doesn't mean that what came before wasn't science. If you accept Newton and Pasteur, you have to also accept the rotten side of earlier times. Eugenics was pushed by some of the most respected **geneticists** of the late 19th and early 20th century. 

 &gt;The goal of increasing the genetic fitness of the population isn't a bad one if you have an adequate understanding of biology and define fitness as the capacity to live a happy, fulfilling life that is relatively free of suffering while not actively causing suffering in an effort to achieve it.

Do you listen to yourself? Allow me to edit this so you can see how ridiculous it is.

John was a tolerant man who tried tolerating women for a year. He said ""something about you women bug me. there is something off about you. something that makes me want to punch you. but I choose to tolerate you women. I will resist that urge to punch you, because I am a tolerant man.""

Everyday, every time John met a woman, he resisted the urge to punch her. And then one day, he thought he'd had enough. ""Fuck it! I cannot do this anymore. I respected them and they don't respect me back!""

His 1 year of tolerance was over. He started to punch women whenever he pleases, he's now back to punching about 3 women a week. That was when he saw his savage friend, Bob. Bob was not going around punching women. John ask Bob ""you noble savages don't punch women? how many years have you been like this? I've tried tolerating women for 1 year and I couldn't continue. Have you ever punched a woman even?""

Bob said ""I have punched a woman twice in my life"". John was shocked, ""what are you a saint? Your tribe has magic power to calm down anger?"". John generalized Bob's characteristic to bob's entire tribe and nicknamed the tribe ""Tribe of massive tolerance"", which was ironic because the tribe doesn't have the notion of tolerance.",1
