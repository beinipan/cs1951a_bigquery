"electoral-vote.com is a site that seems to take the latest poll as the most important, as well as declaring a ""lean"" when the lead falls into the margin of error. A 1 point lead is meaningless if the poll has a margin of error of 2 points (Gallup Daily is usually a 2 point margin of error).

As some replies have mentioned, fivethirtyeight.com is a great source which uses statistics to weight the polls, and I like pollster because they use an average of several polls to take out the margin of error, and they leave states as ""toss up"" until the lead of the candidate is greater than the margin of error.

Quite simply, electoral-vote.com overcalls it. They said win for Kerry when it was really a tie. They are saying 375 electoral votes for Obama, when fivethirtyeight is saying 351 and pollster is saying 306 with 90 too close to call.

Now everyone has no choice but to consider Ron Paul seriously.

The difference is, Giuliani was already known, and these low numbers seriously hurt his candidacy . Ron Paul isn't very well known, and his numbers will make people look at him. ""Who is this person who beat Giuliani?"". Bill Clinton started slow, but once people got to see him, they liked what they saw and his numbers picked up to the point where he won.

What's most ironic is his claim that we are going to restore the ""rule of law in this country"" but yet he supports the Patriot Act and FISA.

"In most presidential elections, the selection of a vice presidential candidate does not make a lot of difference to me, and it probably does not matter to most interested citizens.

This year, however, we have a presidential candidate who has close to zero credentials, running on a mantra of change. Change we probably won't believe, if we ever see it.

Barack Obama won't tell us what he is going to change, and whether the change will be good change or bad change.

He selected Sen. Joe Biden who has 36 years in Washington as a senator. How's that for change?

The ticket can claim almost 40 years of Washington senatorial experience, but neither the top of the ticket nor the second spot has any executive or leadership experience.

The other major candidate is a born leader who doesn't mind making people mad. John McCain makes me mad sometimes, too.

While I disagree with him more than I would like in my candidate, I have tremendous respect for his character and military leadership experience.

I was somewhat lukewarm toward his candidacy, and I was going to vote for him as a vote against the alternative.

McCain's selection of Sarah Palin is a bold move and is indicative of positive change.

This pick has solidified my support. It shows me he is listening to middle America, which is basically hardworking and conservative.

From what I know so far, Palin is one of us. She lives her life conservatively, loves her family unconditionally and has leadership qualities that the Democrat opponents cannot claim.

Most of us can relate to the family issues she is facing, and we can cheer her on as she continues to press forward while dealing with them.

The more the media try to trash her, the more Americans will relate to Palin and rally around her, as they recognize their values and beliefs are being trashed along with hers.",-13

"Early this morning, we reached one million people owning a piece of this campaign.

Think about that for a minute.

One million people like you own a stake in a grassroots movement that is not just
competing, but thriving, in a political process that's been dominated by special
interests for far too long.

You have given your time, energy, and passion to bring about change.

And it's working.

I cannot thank you enough for all you've done, but there are still millions of
Americans who remain on the outside of the political process. They are skeptical of
politicians and disillusioned by the partisan gridlock of Washington, D.C.

Right now, we have an opportunity to reach out to those people and show them that
the change we need is possible.

That's why, on this historic day, we are committing ourselves to a new goal: calling
one million people before the March 4th primaries.

Tuesday's contests in Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Vermont could be decisive in
this race.

Help mark today's historic achievement by picking up the phone, reaching out to
potential supporters, and inviting them to join our movement for change:

http://my.barackobama.com/call

No other campaign has ever reached one million donors while still in a competitive
primary, and I am grateful for your generosity.

This is an important milestone, not just for our campaign, but also for our party.
This level of support will be invaluable as we head toward a general election in
which grassroots participation will be more important than ever.

The next six days could decide whether we get that chance. It will take a massive
effort across the country  to Get Out The Vote on Tuesday, March 4th.

That means reaching out, making phone calls, and building this movement one person
at a time.

You can use our online phonebanking tool to call potential supporters in Texas,
Ohio, Rhode Island, and Vermont from the comfort of your own home.

Start making calls right now:

http://my.barackobama.com/call

When we first started this campaign more than a year ago, the Washington
establishment dismissed the idea of a grassroots movement for change.

Then, when we started winning caucuses and primaries in every part of the country,
they called our victories ""insignificant."" They accused us of spreading ""false hope""
and claimed that we needed a ""reality check.""

Today, no one can say this movement is not real.

More than one million people have taken ownership of this campaign -- and you cannot
be ignored.

Now is the time to pick up the phone and call potential supporters in Texas, Ohio,
Rhode Island, and Vermont.

Make your voice heard and help reach our goal of one million calls before March 4th:

"Ok, here we go.  Sorry if this is a little rambling...

I live in Texas, where I was born and raised.  For the first 10 years of my life, I grew up an upper-middle class childhood.  I don't think I ever saw a black person (except on TV, and then they weren't exactly portrayed positively). 

When I was about 11, my Mom and I had a bit of a ""socioeconomic downturn"" and we moved to a solidly middle class neighborhood in Dallas.  This was my first experience with public school - and people that weren't white.  Because, in my part of Dallas, blacks were almost universally poor, my first real-life encounters weren't exactly positive.

As I got older and attended junior high and high school, two things happened in my life that reinforced my racism.  First, as I got older my dad started telling me what he really thought, and he's very racist.  Second, as I got into junior high and then into high school, all of the lower income elementary/junior high schools started feeding in, and I found myself going to school with more and more black people.  During that entire time, other than the two black girls in my honors classes, I did not have one *single* good experience with a black person.  

All I saw were people who were violent, picked on everybody else, had no ambitions in life, listened to weird music, and dressed and talked in a way that I, frankly, didn't understand at all.  Keep in mind, in my little part of Dallas, this was UNIVERSAL.  There were, except for the aforementioned two honors girls, no exception that I could see to this behavior.

When I got to college I ended up in a dorm that housed primarily athletes.  Again, the only experience I had with blacks in college were with spoiled athletes who didn't care at all about their education and didn't seem to like people like me one little bit.

Over time, I met a few black acquaintances, and I started to question my unfaltering racism.  After a while, I realized that I wasn't so much racist as *culturist*, and I felt I had a right to be.

To some extent, I still feel this way.  I give the INDIVIDUAL the benefit of the doubt, no matter their color or origin, but as a GROUP I still hold a lot of distrust and distaste for popular, lower income black culture.

But with Obama, I've found myself questioning even this.  Sure, there are still aspects of the culture that I find appalling, but if you'd asked me a year ago whether I thought people in the ghetto even voted, I would have laughed at you and said ""I don't even think they know what that word means, it has nothing to do with hoes, weed, or Escalades.""  But recently I've read stories of people in the ghetto lining up to go vote for Obama, and it's caused me to have two revelations:

1) Just because people act a certain way on the outside, doesn't mean they aren't more or less ordinary people on the inside.  They still pay attention to politics and they still want to be part of the citizenry
2) These people were so *hopeless* before, and I think that in part is why they act the way they do, but with Obama I think they see, for the first time since MLK, a REAL role model that can inspire them to be who they REALLY want to be

I still have a long way to go, and I doubt I'll ever see lower income black culture as anything but harmful, but I'm LIGHT YEARS ahead of where I was just 6 months to a year ago, and I credit Obama with that 100%.

I hope that explanation made sense.",3
"You could write Ron Paul in. That way you still voted. You voted for someone you supported. And you gave a big FU to the system that didn't present you with the candidates you felt would do the best job. Just an idea. I voted for Ron Paul in my primary, too. I wanted the Republican Party to present an alternative to Bush. They didn't. Weighing the two who have a shot at it, I believe Obama will do more good and less harm to America than McCain. Since I don't want my country harmed any more than it has been, I'll vote for him.  But you have to decide for yourself what you want to do with your right to vote and if not exercising it is what you choose, so be it.

As a pro-life Obama supporter I can tell you that the only remaining chance to convince most Christians to vote for a pro-choice candidate is to make them see the candidates as a whole.  Show them that Obama cares about the least of us, as Jesus taught, while McCain has been clearly willing to sacrifice all his convictions in order to gain power over us.

"&gt;so if you're not a whiny **narcissist**

Vocabulary fail.  I'm definitely not a narcissist and being a narcissist would have no bearing on deciding who to vote for anyway (unless of course the narcissist voted for himself via write-in I suppose).

&gt;you cut the ""lesser of two evils"" garbage and vote for the side who lines up with your views the most.

The problem is that neither lines up with my views at all.

&gt;ill let you know if i take the time to make a pie chart comparing Obama's stated positions with McCains in relation to Ron Pauls. I've already done the work so i suppose i might as well put it as a visual.

That would be interesting I suppose.  What is Obama's position on getting rid of the Fed, IRS, and just about every other unconstitutional federal bureaucracy?  What about reducing the size of government dramatically and abolishing the federal income tax?

Let's see, what about foreign policy?  Well Obama wants to increase the size of the military, send more troops to Afghanistan, won't remove all the troops from Iraq, advocates attacks on Pakistan's (a country with nuclear weapons) land against their will, makes threatening remarks about Iran even though the inspectors (the same organization that said there were no WMDs in Iraq) say that Iran's program is not a weapon's program, and makes threatening remarks about Russia's reaction to Georgia's aggression (and even Condi Rice admits the Georgians started it).  Let's see that sounds nothing like Ron Paul's position of closing every single military base that is on foreign soil and bringing all the troops home.

What about the War on Drugs, state's rights, the Patriot Act, the FISA amendments, our civil liberties?",2
"&gt;Negotiate iran on these points : first they don't build their own nuclear rectors but they get the nuclear fuel from countries that have nuclear technology and won't use these supplies to control iran, Russia for example.

I honestly don't think that can happen, not as long as Iran has oil.  If America, Europe or Israel don't try to control Iran with nuclear fuel, China or Russia will.  Remember, in international politics everyone is a bastard.  I think nuclear power is one of the best solutions to the oil problem, but there's almost no chance Iran can buy any from another country without coming under that country's influence.

&gt;Another thing give syria and lebanon back their land and Hezbollah won't even exist anymore: the debate now in lebanon is that Hezbollah should be integrated into the lebanese army and become under the control of the army, but the only hurdle is that Chibaa farms (a part of the lebanese territory) is still occupied by israel.

Shebaa Farms is a perfect example of how the Arab states get into these ridiculous conflicts with Israel.  Israel took the farms because in 1967 they were ""owned"" by Syria, although Lebanon disagrees and claims the farms as their own.  Israel took the Golan Heights and considers Shebaa a part of the Golan, and doesn't care about the dispute between the two Arab nations over them.  Lebanon and Syria use the Israeli presence there as an excuse not to decide which one of those two actually owns the farms.  AFAIK, residents there in the pre-1967 days actually regarded themselves as Lebanese despite the clear Syrian rulership.

How about Israel negotiates on Shebaa Farms after the Arab nations agree with each other who owns it, and therefore who negotiates with Israel for it?

&gt;Also negotiation between syria and israel will make sure that no resistance will be present in the Golan heights, because the syrian regime isn't as u think, Bashar EL assad is killing his own generals to make sure that no eveidence exists on crimes he made, so he will forget about palestine when some motives are given to him.

The basic problem with the Golan Heights is that it contains the Banyas spring, one of the tributaries of the Jordan River.  Syria had started developing that spring in such a way that would have totally cut off the flow of the spring into Israel in the '60s, and this was one of the original reasons Israel took the Golan: water security.  At least until we invent an energy-efficient technology for distilling seawater, I cannot see what Syria could possibly offer to warrant giving back the Golan, but if/once the Israelis have another reliable source of fresh-water, public sentiment as I've polled it is that giving the Golan back to Syria will become inevitable.

So we'll give the Golan back, we just need another guaranteed source of fresh-water.

&gt;Egypt and Jordan are trying so hard to stop arms and even food and medical help to arive to palestine when israel wants them too.

Don't kid me.  This is the Middle East.  Why stop food and medical supplies flowing to people who bribe your guards?  And if some arms get in, they're being used against Israel, so who cares?  Might not want to wage the war themselves, but they'll look the other way at a certain level of low-level corruption that feeds Palestinian ""liberation"" efforts.

&gt;Another thing, lebanon, all of it, will never recognize israel as a country because it's against our religion, but we don't want to wage wars against israel because lebanon (a 3.5mln people 10000m2 country) is very small and not as strong as israel and have enough problems of his own.

Against your religion?  Which religion is that?  I've met a great many Lebanese Christians on the Western side of the Atlantic ocean; they all moved to America and Europe when the Muslims kicked them out.  These Christians seem to have no problem *at all* with recognizing Israel and making a full peace agreement once a few issues like Shebaa Farms are covered.  If I remember my world history class, modern Lebanon was supposedly established as a tri-religious country: Christian, Sunni, and Shiite.

But if the Muslim extremists have driven/scared most of the Christians into exile and you Muslims find it against your religion to recognize a non-Muslim state in the Middle East, I suppose we will have to remain in ""war with truce"".  That *really sucks*.

&gt;then we don't think and we don't want mccain, we hate bush so much we don't want anyone that is even close to bush to become president. (i watched the debate and i think obama was great)

Obama was pretty damn good, I agree.  It would be nice to have a return to American politics-as-usual in which moral panics over metal music making kids have rough sex take up more governmental time than which Muslim country to invade tomorrow ;-).

&gt;that the average Lebanese person speaks and talks and writes in 3 languages (Arabic, English and French). 

I had a fairly decent idea of this.  They used to call Beirut the ""Paris of the Middle East"", a multicultural center to rival any other.  A pity that you're now a ""Muslim-only"" country who won't recognize your Southern neighbor or except your own expatriates as countrymen.

&gt;We have internet and we have cable channels, we watch CNN and BBC (for 10$ a month u get shotime channels and 100 other channel from arround the world ) we also have iphones that are hacked to work on prepaid sim cards, arab people aren't stupid as the west think, u just don't follow our news as u should... (not u in person)

Well of course Arabs aren't stupid.  We Westerners just consider Arabs (with the exception of Lebanese and Palestinians) woefully under-informed.  Of course, that ignores that the educations in history given to children in many Arab countries (including Palestine, one of the few gaps in Palestinian education) have gaping, obvious flaws in them when viewed from a Western perspective -- specifically in teaching the supposed superiority of Arab/Muslim culture and the desirability of its dominance throughout the region.

I see Dubai and Iran as the models for the Muslim countries of the region: let the Middle-Easterners develop into modern nations their own way, so that they look out and see a world in which people free to be religious or secular, capitalist or communist, exist in their own culture rather than an imposed Western/Russian culture.",1

"Yes, taxing capital gains at higher rates will take away some of the incentive to invest long-term.  However, the US owes $12 trillion and currently runs a significant deficit every year.

Probably best to disincentivize dying since it's the only thing rich people can't help doing like the rest of us. the gov will still need money, so I think best to raise cap gains next...

"no, my assumption was not that the best man wins. It is the candidate most able to become popular that wins. It is an indisputable fact, that in the Democratic primary, Clinton and Obama are the most popular candidates. The popularity of a candidate can be measured by their votes. Since they are already now popular, one can only work backwards and look back as to how those candidates became popular, through their actions and their words, through circumstances both inside and outside their control, and through the alternative choices voters had, every single voter had their list of criteria, their own personal priorities, looked at the candidates, and made their choice.

That is democracy, but if you want to look at the depth, you can't point to the surface and say ""it is democracy"". If you want to fully understand it, you have to look deep and get the big picture.

The best man does win the election. It is not the one best able to be president, it is not the one best able to run the country. It is not the one who is best at economy or military tactics. It is the candidate who is best able to get votes. The one who is best able to be popular. But this is only the surface. It is a simplification of the system. To understand the complexity, one must look into the details as to why someone has become popular.

A voter has many different reasons for picking a candidate, but one can approach it much like when going shopping. People will go with what they know first. The name brand. Hillary was the name brand, so she got the early head start. Faced with a variety of choices where all but one is unknown, most will go with what they know. George W. Bush had this advantage when he started, the Bush family name.

From there, a candidate must convince voters that they are a better choice. That's what campaigning is all about. It's a sales pitch, where each talk about their qualities, and every voter makes their own personal choice as to which one to go with.

My only point, a couple of posts earlier, when you combine Hillary and Obama on the same ticket, the criteria people used to decide on their candidate, becomes mutually exclusive. Usually the most popular criteria are describe in simple terms, such as ""Anti-Hillary"", which described those who looked at Hillary and deemed her unsuitable for President. There is also an Anti-Obama group who are voting for Hillary because they've deemed Obama unsuitable for president. These 2 groups would not be happy with a Clinton/Obama ticket. Just calling it the ""Anti-Clinton"" and ""Anti-Obama"" is both a simplification and a bit of a slur. Each person in those groups have chosen their own reasons for being opposed to a candidate, but the end result is the same. Some in the ""Anti-Clinton"" group may have also decided that Obama is a president worth voting for, but some could be voting for whomever is popular so that Clinton does not become elected.

I only called it unpredictable because I don't think anyone knows what the sizable Anit-Hillary voters would do in such a situation. Would they vote for the pair anyway because Obama is on the ticket, would they abstain and refuse to vote, or would they vote Republican or Independant.",1

Oh the hidden business interests, huh?

I'm sure you have incontrovertible proof before making an assumption like that.

Suddenly everything makes more sense.

I'm not about to say I agree with Obama's stance on Israel or what he says about Carter.

I'm also not about to delude myself into thinking that an anti-Israeli politician could win an election. 

Carter was no saint when he ran, and when he was in office. His position offers him a lot more freedom in his views and actions that Obama has as a candidate. 

The truth is, the majority of Americans are Judeo-Christian and feel passionately about the protection and conservation of the Judeo-Christian holy land against the evil Muslim invaders.

Okay, perhaps I came on a bit heavily with that but honestly, he was talking about McCain's policy before that, he wraps it up with another equivalent metaphor about how you can call a fish change and it'll still stink 8 years later.

I just don't get the logic behind the Republican outrage about this.  I mean, do they assuming this was an intentional cut?  Do they believe that Obama wanted to insult Palin, so he planned to discuss the flaws with McCain's policy for several minutes as a pretext for (diabolically) slipping in this cliché phrase to sting Palin?  Perhaps he was consulting w/ Osama Bin Laden to get this master plan?

My wager is that it was poor phrasing on Obama's part or a set-up, where he wanted to portray himself as the honest politician and set out low hanging fruit for Palin &amp; McCain to grab.  Then he could blast back about how they're playing games.  True, but ultimately pretty stupid given how many dumb voters we have in this nation

He is no sound-byte ideologue; if Obama actually talks in complete sentences and paragraphs, with facts to back this up, Nader wrote the book on doing so, and has set the standard. If Obama was a community organizer of some skill and commitment, again, Nader represents the most solid example of how this is done in good times and in bad.

BTW: They aren't extrapolations they're calculations directly from the exit poll data. Go look at them and compare them to the results. They are very very accurate.

Edit: Also 2004 primary was not presidential, you have to go back to 2000 which was republican only and that drew 1.4 republican voters to the polls, vs 870K this round for repubs.

"First of all, Mercyseat, let's be fair - LOTS of politicians and presidents say things that come out wrong, and later bite them in the ass.  There have been plenty of examples of this.  We've all been guilty of saying something that sounded different from what we meant.  But Obama is, for the most part, very well spoken, and doesn't make that mistake very often.  So let's be judicious about this, and not start throwing stones when we ALL live in glass houses.

Second, let's examine this in the context both of the original speech he gave, as well as the specific comment he made.  Most people are playing that tiny clip over and over again, out of context of what he actually said.  In fact, even Chris Wallace, the fox Pundit, criticized his colleagues for making an issue of that comment, and playing it out of context.  So let's look at it:

In Obama's original speech, he talked about many problems in the black AND white communities in terms of race-relations.  At one point he talked about his grandmother ""a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.""

Was he saying that his Grandmother was racist?  A woman who helped raise a half-black man?  No, he was simply suggesting that it's not quite as clear cut as that.  And that sometimes, when we over-simplify things into ""black and white"" we aren't seeing things for what they are.  Sometimes, like Obama, things come in shades which are not quite so defined - and we're not treating an issue with the respect it deserves when we try to take a world of color, and see it through a monochrome lens.

In the same speech, he talked about some of the ""black"" perceptions of the race problem, things that people don't talk about in polite company.  And as part of it, he also talked about some of the things White people don't talk about in polite company, saying ""when (white people are) told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time.""

The point I took from this was that sometimes people are justifiably afraid when they're in a bad neighborhood.  If that neighborhood happens to be a white neighborhood, and if a rough looking white guy walks past, and they feel nervous,  no one bats an eye.  They're simply being judicious about recognizing that they're in a dangerous area.  But if it's a black neighborhood, and it's a black man walking past, and they feel nervous - well, white people are sometimes told that their fear makes them racist.  They're reacting to the crime and character of the neighborhood, not the race of it - and they feel resentment for being ""pigeon-holed"".

Now, I fully recognize that there are white people who would lock the car door solely in reaction to the race of the person walking by.  And yes, in this instance, it is absolutely a form of racism.  But I personally believe that Obama was trying to point out, and imply, that our society is more complicated than that, and that's not always the situation.

So later, after the speech, Obama made the statement which people are talking about.  He said: ""...the point I was making was not that my grandmother harbors any racial animosity. She doesn’t. But she is a typical white person who, you know, if she sees somebody on the street that she doesn’t know, there is a reaction that has been bred into our experiences that don’t go away and sometimes come out in the wrong way.""

Now, this statement is ambiguous.  And it deserves to be examined.  But not just examined by itself, it must be examined IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER STATEMENTS OBAMA HAS ALSO MADE.  So, is he trying to say that his Grandmother was racist, and that is typical of all white people?  Of course not.  That's the opposite point of his entire speech.  His point was that his Grandmother was a typical white person, WHO IS NOT RACIST.  And his point is that even people who are not racist can occasionally have moments where they are not always as racially sensitive as they should be.  

I think his point is that we all live in an imperfect world, and until we can see this world for the way it is, and until we can responsibly address it with the complexity it deserves, we are doomed to oversimplify the problem, and by doing so, perpetuate it.

Which, by the way, when we take tiny snippets of a speech, and take them out of context, is exactly what we're doing.  We're contributing to the problem, not helping to solve it.

He's trying not to say a lie and not say he didn't have sexual relations.  I give him credit for being more squirrelly then Clinton.  Bill Clinton should have said I had no Romantic Relations with that woman!  And later when caught he could have said I never lied, what I did was not Romantic. 

“It is a shame that The New York Times has lowered its standards to engage in a hit-and-run smear campaign. John McCain has a 24-year record of serving our country with honor and integrity. He has never violated the public trust, never done favors for special interests or lobbyists, and he will not allow a smear campaign to distract from the issues at stake in this election.

“Americans are sick and tired of this kind of gutter politics, and there is nothing in this story to suggest that John McCain has ever violated the principles that have guided his career.”",1

From the inception of this program in 1976 through 1992, almost all candidates who could qualify accepted matching funds in the primary. However, in 1996 Republican Steve Forbes opted out of the program. In 2000, Forbes and George W. Bush opted out. In 2004 Bush and Democrats John Kerry and Howard Dean chose not to take matching funds in the primary.

In 2008, Democrats Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Republicans Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and Ron Paul decided not to take matching funds. Republican Tom Tancredo[4] &amp; John McCain and Democrats Chris Dodd[5], Joe Biden[6] and John Edwards elected to take public financing.",3

"Here's what I wrote. It's hokey, but whatever...

My name is Xxxxxxx Xxxxxxx. I am a 30 year old woman from Xxxxxxxx. Growing up, I was raised in an extremely conservative household where the line between religion and politics was blurred. I was force fed beliefs and discouraged to examine them, since the thinking had already been done by somebody far smarter than I. As a young adult, I voted for Bob Dole and George W. Bush. 

In 1999, I graduated from college and entered the real world. In 2001, I was shocked by the events of 9/11. These events forced me to re-examine my values and started me down a path of thinking for myself.

Since that time, I have been thoroughly appalled by the Bush Administration. It has seemed like an unfolding nightmare. I have been shocked and dismayed at the blatant lies. 

I have watched basic human rights get revoked in the name of security. I have watched illegal wars get waged. I have watched our nation plunge into debt and our citizens go without health care. I have watched countless abuses of power. 

Above all, I have watched leaders of a representative democracy forget that they are beholden to the people. 

We cannot go on like this. It has to stop.

I have nothing but great respect for Senator Clinton, but I have no memories of a time when a Bush or a Clinton was not president. I question whether dynasty is good for the country. In my fast-paced profession, it's a good management strategy to bring in ""new-blood"" every few years, to escape the ultimate inevitability of fossilized thinking. 

We need a leader who will take the dictatorial powers this executive branch has accrued and release them back to the people. We need a leader who will restore our credibility in the eyes of the world. We need a leader who can inspire bipartisanship on a level never seen before to address the enormous problems we have.

I believe Barack Obama is that leader. 

I understand there are concerns. Concerns about his democratic managerial style and whether it is conducive to getting things done. Concerns about his depth of experience  and learning curve. I share those concerns and have weighed them in my decision. But ultimately, I firmly believe that Obama's commitment to an open government is the cure to what ales our divided nation right now.

This is why I went to caucus for the first time in my life. 

This is why I signed up to be a delegate at my county level at my first ever Caucus.

This is why I made my first, second, and third ever campaign contributions this year.

I am acting now because I have never felt so strongly about a political decision. This is a crucial time in our nation's history. Everybody I talk to can feel it. 

Please consider voting for Barack Obama at the upcoming Democratic National Convention.",1
"&gt;I don't want a president who is ok with telling me I am only faithful because things are bad.

Good thing that's not what he said then, isn't it?  He said that people **cling** to their faith when things are bad.  As in, they had faith when things were good, but when things turned sour, they make faith the *only* thing that they care about.  They stop concerning themselves with other important issues because they feel powerless to effect any sort of change.  They just pick a couple of issues, and cling to those when it come to elections.  ""Who cares what candidate A's economic policies are?  Who cares what his foreign policies are?  He's not anti-gay-marriage, so he's not getting my vote!""

**That's** what Obama meant.

&gt;you see it says free state? that means free from foreign aggressors or anyone else who tries to take away said freedom, including our own government.

Quite.

&gt;It says ""people"" not militia or army or what have you.

It says, in partially stilted language, ""Because militias are necessary, the federal government can't infringe on the people's right to bear arms.""

The first thing to take away from that is that the whole thing is qualified by the necessity of a militia.  That paints having a militia as being the overarching *reason* that the amendment exists.

The other thing to be aware of is that it's not clear if ""people"" means individuals, or the citizenry in general.  Current laws tend toward the latter interpretation, and thus violent felons are disallowed from owning any sort of firearms at all.

From those two observations, it seems clear to me that only allowing people who are in organized militias to own firearms would be perfectly constitutional.

If you want to go the route of an *unorganized* militia consisting of all citizens, and ""the people"" meaning all individuals, then not only is it unconstitutional to preclude felons from owning firearms, but it's also unconstitutional to preclude people from owning any and all military armaments.

&gt;I think it should be ok for anyperson to use so long as they didn't infringe on the rights of others.

The sticking point here is whether or not what you *think* should be allowed (and I mostly agree with your assessment) meshes with what's *constitutionally protected*.",0

"And it is compiled by a Republican, so guess what conclusion it comes to...McCain is a saint!  No pork!  Of course, the war he voted for doesn't count, somehow, but education projects for Obama's constituents?  Earmarks, disgraceful wastes of taxpayer money.

Bullshit. Ron Paul is inspiring because he actually speaks the truth. What big truths is Obama saying? He's a good motivational speaker but he's not speaking the truth about anything. His foreign policy is neo-con light. He hasn't mentioned ending the War on Drugs. What is he going to do?,1
"THe sudden sharp drop of Edwards is the result of his announcement to drop out. At the same time, both Clinton and Obama see a surge in their numbers, but that of Obama is much more significant, and puts him ver close to Clinton just in time for super tuesday.",2
"True, and I like debates too. However, I like debates that focus on *one* specific issue and therefore allow in depth policy discussion. What Congressman Paul said about McCain and Romney nitpicking about Iraq was true, but give them an entire hour+ to discuss their positions and the general population finally gets to see past two minute answers and start to understand a candidate's ideologies, and more important, their intelligence level/level of understanding of the issues.

Certainly Senator Clinton wants to tie up Senator Obama to a certain degree, but I find it worrisome that Obama would rather take advantage of the situations in which he can dispense his message uncontested. I have found that he has a higher percentage of followers who are swayed by his impressive rhetoric rather than his knowledge of and ability to discuss issues.",1
"Not so sure about that.  She has no national campaign experience. She has to debate Joe Biden, which will be a humbling experience.  She has less experience than Obama which severely undermines a primary line of attack.  Hillary Clinton will undoubtedly be brought out on the offensive against her to make it clear that Palin's stances on abortion are not in line with most of the women HRC has gotten support for.  

Brilliant, eh... we'll see.  I think this could explode in McCain's face.  If Republicans can't attack Obama on experience, all they have left is ""celebrity"" and that is not going to win the election.",3
"I was responding to your statement that MCcain had been asked far more tough quwtions than Obama.

I posed one to you that NO ONE has asked, and EVERYONE should be curious about, as it goes to the core of *his* chararcter.

I was not even looking at the article.  But you dodged well.  But you still dodged the question.

Whatever you do, don't research the point I raised.",1

&gt; I have a special request for you.

&gt; 

&gt; The Obama-Biden Transition Project is a nonpartisan entity whose purpose is to facilitate the transition to a new government and prepare for the next administration.

&gt; 

&gt; In the past, efforts like these have often been very secretive and funded by the D.C. lobbying and corporate community.

&gt; 

&gt; But, like in the campaign, we've decided to do things differently.

&gt; 

&gt; For the first time, transition efforts won't be financed with donations from Washington lobbyists and PACs -- which means we'll need to keep asking for your help. Your generosity during the campaign helped get us here, but building a more transparent and open government means continuing to rely on a broader group of people to do this the right way.

&gt; 

&gt; We only have a few weeks to assess the state of the federal agencies, prepare our agenda, and staff key positions in the new administration. Your support right now will be crucial to helping us accomplish these goals.

&gt; 

&gt; Will you help support the urgent mission of our transition team with a donation of $100 or more?

"Yeah, good thing Obama's team had good practice going up against female candidates. Using smart, careful remarks.

Thanks Hillary!",2
"Really, I'll stipulate Khalidi is PLO, that Obama is lying, and that Breck Girl got his dick wet.  I'm still focusing on the $75,000.  However much I root against Khalidi, however much I despise Hezballah (which is more dangerous these days backed by Iran and Syria both than Hamas), however much I think bombers and radicals should rot in prison, however much I despise that that murderer just got released in that prisoner exchange for a dead body in Israel, THAT $75,000 was probably a really good investment in OUR peace and prosperity.  

Really, that's all I'm saying.  

Khalidi probably isn't even an extremist in the context of people who want to kill Israelis and profiteer off American prosperity from a safe distance.  There are people ready to walk into schools and blow themselves up merely with the hope of taking a few Jews with them.  

But American freedom and prosperity has to be open to Arab immigrants who are honest and hard working and willing to live by the rules.  Not all Germans were Nazis, not all Italians were fascists, and the vast majority of Arabs are honest and hard working, too.  

As a younger man I could name for you a long list Arafat proteges who were with him Munich in 1972 murdering Israeli athletes (although oddly, I couldn't name the athletes).  I'm staunch, believe me.  

I've known Palestinians I'd have gladly taken out with my bare hands, and Palestinians I would have trusted in a proverbial foxhole with my life (proverbial because I didn't volunteer to serve, and knowing what I know now about my health, I sincerely believe I'd have been a lousy investment and risk for country--I just have some really fucked up parts).  

Khalidi may be a nice guy to talk to, or he may be an arrogant blowhard, I don't know.  He certainly backs and has backed murderers, at least in his speaking and writing.  I don't know if he killed Jews during the war in Lebanon in 1982, but I doubt it.  I don't think he'd have risked his career by soiling his hands.  

I'm just saying that $75,000 was probably well spent.  I suspect that Khalidi is human enough or corrupt enough to be useful to bring an end to endless Middle East war, but maybe I'm being an optimist.  In any event, the crazy-assed Palestinians need to be heard before they can be reconciled to the reality of Israel.  I'm sincere in these beliefs, too, but know damn well that there will always be enemies who want us dead.  I'd rather they speak up than lurk in darkness.  I don't believe their ideas will prevail if we are honest to our ideals.  

That probably means letting the bomber go if the bungled the evidence, and letting the hate-monger write and talk.  

But let's applaud the efforts of the honest folk to bring the ignorant into our mainstream.  That's what that (stupidly named) Arab American Action Network.  Holy fuck, it sounds like a terrorist organization, but it's just a neighborhood help group.  Like the YMCA for Arabs.  

I'd even say, don't tap Khalidi's phone or read his email.  I bet the people he's most in contact with in the middle east are bloody jealous of his cushy job and big title, and rather than blow us up, most of them just want a chance to have a catbird seat like his.  

Hey, sorry I get longwinded, and know I respect your opinions and appreciate your reading mine fairly.  I know I piss you off, but I do appreciate your hearing me out.  Take care.  ",0
"&gt;Florida and Michigan should count, both in the interest of fundamental fairness and honoring the spirit of the Democrats' 50-state strategy.

"During the 2004 election in Ohio the then secretary of state Ken Blackwell said he'd rather go to jail than follow court orders to stop illegal voter purges.

Now four years later the secretary of state is a democrat but there are still 100,000 fewer people registered in Ohio than there were in 2004.  It won't surprise me at all if the state goes to McCain despite Obama polling slightly ahead.

I concur, but its going to get pretty painful in the next few months, so maybe that pain will be correctly attributed to the parties that caused it.

Its my contention, that I really don't care what criticisms the GOP have of Obama's economic plan. Especially after this huge clusterfuck, the GOP controlled ever branch of U.S. government and let lose the purse-strings after big talk of fiscal conservatism.

The problem isn't just that they're thinking with their Bibles, it's that they're thinking with their irrational interpretation of the Bible.

While I wish everyone were agnostic like myself, I think most Christians aren't ready to let go of God just yet. Judging by people's behavior, (regardless of what they profess) most Christians do not interpret the Bible literally. Perhaps atheists should consider that the best way to achieve a favorable outcome might be to attend and support churches that preach a less literal, more liberal, tolerant  -and frankly, more Christlike- form of Christianity and hope for a gradual fade-out rather than leaving people with the choice of either brutal nihilism or fascism masquerading as Christianity.",1

- What if McCain were still married to the first woman he said ""I do"" to? What if Obama were the candidate who left his first wife after she no longer measured up to his standards?

- What if Michelle Obama were a wife who not only became addicted to pain killers, but acquired them illegally through her charitable organization? What if Cindy McCain graduated from Harvard?

- What if Obama were a member of the ""Keating 5""? What if McCain was a charismatic, eloquent speaker?

If these questions reflected reality, do you really believe the election numbers would be as close as they are?

This is what racism does. It covers up, rationalizes and maximizes positive qualities in one candidate and emphasizes negative qualities in another when there is a color difference.

So Obama goes to church...why?,1
"Zbigniew Brzezinski has endorsed your Obama candidate - Obama is no longer against the machine when the David Rockefeller protege, founder of the trilateral commission, and creator of Al Qeada via Operation Cyclone is behind him. 

Obama is also said ""Theres not much difference between my position on Iraq and George Bush’s position at this stage"". The difference in my mind is whos in a position to execute.""

Read Shadows of Power James Perloff for more info on Brezinski - http://www.bravenewbookstore.com/product_info.php?products_id=35 The anglo american establishment is backing Obama 100% with this endorsement - its probably worse than the military industrial complex endorsing Hitlery.

Obamas wife Michelle is the Vice President of the council on foreign relations too - A globalist establishment group formed by the globalist bankers and is dedicated to ending American Sovereignty - read that book I linked for more info on them.

"&gt;Whatever the semantics I still think you underestimate how very far off libertarians values are from those of the main two candidates. It is no simple compromise.

I wrote up a big reply, but then deleted it.

The point is this: plenty of libertarians will vote for McCain or Obama. I assume they do not agree that they are capitulating on their philosophy, at least for the most part. Although it might be a big deal for *you* that's different from it being a big deal for libertarians full stop.

And while a general respect for the American constitution is definitly better then the crap Bush has been doing to it ; it isn't a guarantee for better stateman-ship either. Seriously, the thing was written in an entirely different era, to think that all of it has some supreme wisdom that will transcend the ages is rather ridiculous. It's better then Bush's lawlessness, but it ain't a golden turd, just yet...

I've heard Paul say smart stuff but I've also heard him say enormously stupid shit. Frankly his denial of evolution is rather scary. Not because he wants to force feed us his believes (he doesn't) but because it means he values his own ideology higher then scientific discourse. There is no excuse for that. 
That having said: Obama's stance on this IS frightening, there is no denying that but it's too early to let the 'I told ya so' ruin this otherwise good party...

He has been in the senate to vote four times to fund the occupation. If he had voted no, he would have voted the way Obama supporters to this day think his position is.  They voted for him thinking that, and ""terrorist sympathizer"" was used and ignored.  By voting repeatedly voting yes, along with the rest of his horrible voting, and   what he's filling his cabinet with, he's shows he's no different.  No definition for what ""it"" is other than the tactic ""terror,"" and unrealistic demands of Iraq to make sure the occupation never ends, makes your justification for Obama's plan of non stop military expansion while calling it ""withraw"" a super denial.

"To extrapolate on that thought, Obama promises to remove some of the powers of the Presidency that Bush, Justice Roberts (formerly a presidential lawyer), Justice Alito (formerly a presidential lawyer), and almost Harriet Miers (formerly a persidential lawyer) were doing to the supreme court's constitutional understanding of the President's power. Obama pledges to undo Presidential Signing statements and only put judges on that respect the core of the constitution as a protector of civil and personal rights. I was scared to approach Bush for his crimes, no one else would, and I don't have that same fear of Obama. I feel like he's more approachable because that is how he has made himself. Could he change? Sure, but ""will someone wildly change at random"" is not how I choose my Presidency. I'd bet McCain would go senile first anyway.",1

&gt;This is a straw man; I never implied that anybody hates gays. 

you should have. This guy hates gay people. There are lots of preachers who don't hate gay people who would be honored to give the invocation speech and they should be given the opportunity over this hateful person who is divisive.

&gt;I would be very surprised if the invocation includes anti-gay rhetoric.

Besides the point. He has made his feelings about gay people known in other forums.

There are better qualified, less hateful, more inclusive, more loving people who could do the job just as well if not better.

&gt;He's actually done some great things in regard to poverty and moderating religious extremism.

He is a religious extremist. 

&gt;e has some good qualities that merit respect, and recognizing him and honoring him for those positive contributions doesn't mean you're disrespecting gay people.

Yes it is. Many evil people have done nice things. Most mass murderers are described as nice people who were the pillars of society and were active in charities.

This guy doesn't deserve the honor of giving the invocation at any president's inauguration. There are a million people who are more deserving.

I encourage everybody there to turn their backs to him while he is speaking.  He needs to know that there are consequences to his hate speech.

If Iraq is to go through a 16 month pull out (it's clever how we'll still stay in Afghanistan), by  by the time additional troops gets budgeted for will only have gotten out of boot. What would they be used for? After-action preparation and training would have no use for the additional troops.

I agree that that is a trick we should use, but consider the opposing team. It is in their interests to disguise themselves to trick voters into believing their stories. 

Therein lies my whole problem with Obama. I believe he is a wolf in sheep's clothing. I believe Democratic party leaders have groomed him to fill this role and implement their strategies. How else does someone raise from nothing to center stage so quickly and under a system that is so stacked against them?

&gt; The bundlers you speak of are mostly people who work at a company that employs lobbyists, or people whose lobbying registrations have been widtdrawn. 

Which is the perfect plan if you want to groom a candidate to be different or an outsider. Get these law firms to contribute the money

But your claim was that Obama was different and special for not accepting this type of money. Now you're admitting that he indeed accepts this kinda donation. You know it and I know it, but how many people have been deceived into thinking Obama is different for not taking ""special interest money"", when he actually does.

A quote from my previous link:

&gt; ""But overall, the same wealthy interests are funding his campaign as are funding other candidates, whether or not they are lobbyists.""

So Obama is no different than the others. You can try and claim that Clinton or any of the other candidates are corrupt for taking the money, but Obama not only took the money, but clouded the fact that he took it more than any of the other candidates. That is deceitful.

I don't want you get me wrong, I don't like Clinton or McCain. I just find it distasteful that Obama is pretending to be different and the MSM feeds (rather crams) this message to the public. Whereas in fact, he's just like the others.

This is just like when Obama repeats his mantra ""I was never for the war"" he fails to mention he was not in the U.S. Senate at the time. He was in the Illinois Senate.  Obama is proving how he is not not really for change by being misleading to the American public.

What he sponsored was  a ""section"" of the bill that requires Inspector General reports of military health care facilities be published on the internet.  While that may seem all fine and dandy, but if you read the bill  
You can see that Obama's contribution was rather minute when compared to the rest of the bill.  You can view my sources at www.hillarygreenmountain.org",1
"And signed off on most anything Bush asked them to. Look at Obama, when he was running for senate he said he would block war funding, but rubber stamped every war funding bill that came accross his desk after he was elected (much like most of the dems elected in 04)",6

Remember when all you morons didn't think Obama was going to win the Presidency?,2
"If Hillary Clinton is named the Democratic nominee, remember, she did it by attacking the rights of black people to vote in Presidential primaries.

We're already seeing a push by Hillary Clinton's camp to ""reseat"" delegates from Michigan and Florida, which were taken away by the DNC previously.

Florida is probably similar, but I'm in Michigan, and I can tell what I feel is happening here.

Michigan is home to Detroit, which has about 900k people, 700k-ish of which are African American, in a state of about 10M people.

Some months ago, it was clear that Obama was Clinton's #1 competitor. If he was even marginally successful, Detroit's vote, along with other cities with large/majority African American populations, such as Flint or Grand Rapids, would give Obama an easy victory in Michigan, and despite our losses, we're still a top 10 state.

So, our Governor Jennifer Granholm, who endorses Hillary Clinton, agreed to hold an early primary (Jan 15, 2008), probably knowing that Hillary Clinton's friends within the DNC would then cut our votes out of the Democratic Nomination, eliminating this advantage for Obama and giving Clinton the edge she needs. Michigan Republicans, seeing a chance to make the Democrats look bad by ignoring Michigan voters, agreed, and the changes sailed through.

And that's exactly what happened.

Clinton broke her pledge not to campaign here, stayed on the ballot when all of the other democrats pulled out, and won a pointless victory.

Now there is talk that our Governor Granholm is joining the Clinton administration, for all of her ""help"" in ""winning"" Michigan.

""help"" in suppressing the black vote.

And we can expect Clinton to push hard to make those delegate votes count again. Delegates selected without the favored candidate of the likely majority of Democratic voters.

It's just another way to ""keep the black man down""

How sad.",6

Really?

Here are two reason you gave for why you hate obama.

1) Obama is under the spell of wright who has been brainwashing him for twenty years with hatred for america.

2) Obama disowned wright.

These two statements contradict. They both can't be true at the same time.

&gt;You're forgetting that he only disowned when it became politically expedient - before that he affirmed he could no more disown him than he could his own grandmother.

But he did disown him and that's why you hate obama.

So why would you hate somebody for eventually doing something you approve of?

There are a slew of issues Clinton and Barack are talking about outside the MSM that have voter attention. If all you watch is TV news, you'll get the opinion you have.

Not really. He's got the figures to win anyway. All the superdelegates need to do is vote their will of their constituents. It's not a favor to vote in the person popularly elected by the party members.

""That doesn't address any of the current problems faced by this country""

A clever public speaker makes all his attacks like the first example. Take, for instance, McCain's subtle attacks on Obama this week. He never mentioned who he was talking about, and only made positive references to his own policies that contradict Obama's policies. It was clear who he was talking about, but he never touched that mud.",1
"I base part of my support for Obama on my experience of walking in his shoes. One of my first jobs was the same as his first job: Community organizer. There were differences (namely, a couple of decades and about 1,000 miles to the west) but every day that I worked in that capacity, my respect for Obama grew. 

He turned down a prestigious position as a federal appellate clerk to work for $13,000 a year as a community organizer, and he kept it up for far longer than I could ever have lasted.

I lasted three months in his job and I couldn't take a day more. It's too stressful. You do good in the community, but the rewards are delayed by weeks or months, and you confront ignorance and apathy dozens of times every day--and that's on a good day.

Nobody would make that choice for political gain, especially as a young recent grad. The clerkship would have served political ambition equally well, if not better, and been less stressful by far. I believe that Obama does care about poor and middle class Americans, and that he does believe in public service for its own sake, and that belief stems from many things, but it starts with his work as a community organizer.",6
"If what seems to be almost everyone on Reddit could read and/or wasn't so ignorant they'd see that Obama hasn't changed his stance.

Obama supports wiretapping in cases backed by evidence when a warrant is issued by a judge, as is allowed by FISA. There's nothing wrong with this as long as their is oversight.

Obama does NOT support retroactive immunity. He said the House version of the bill was an improvement over the Protect America Act because it restores FISA and does not allow warrantless wiretapping which is what we all want. The House version of the bill includes retroactive immunity, so Obama said (in the same quote that got everyone in a furor) that he's going to try his hardest to get immunity removed from the Senate version of the bill.

Have none of you learned how bills are made? It's very common for the House and Senate to pass different versions of a bill. The different versions are sent to a Committee where a compromise is worked out and then both houses vote on the compromise bill. Obama is going to try to remove retroactive immunity from the Senate version and have it kept that way in the compromise version.

Are you so quick to jump on a bandwagon that you can't even read the full quote for yourself and think about what he's really saying, or do you not even support legal, with-warrant wiretapping?",1

From many of the comments I’ve seen here, it’s apparent that many people are experiencing a sort of letdown that inevitably happens at some point because NO candidate is perfect.  Every candidate faces political realities that force difficult choices.  Obama’s political reality today was a very harsh one:  he could have voted against this bill, and then been open to right-wing attackers saying, “He’s soft on terrorists”... AND the bill would have passed anyway by a wide margin, likely 68-29.

"You wrote:
&gt;""t isn't like McCain got any of his houses through a sweetheart deal with a sleaze-ball currently facing federal charges of attempted extortion, money laundering, and fraud.""

True.  McCain's most notable sleaze-fest (that we know of) took place during the 1980s Savings &amp; Loan Crisis, the indictment phase of which is long over.  But besides campaign contributions from Charles Keating, McCain apparently also received several trips to Keating's estate in the Bahamas.  Oh, and McCain's wife and father-in-law were involved in a shopping-center development deal with Keating.

From the Wikipedia article on the ""Keating Five"":
&gt;""McCain received $112,000 by 1987 from Keating and Keating's relatives and employees to McCain's Senate campaign, more than any of the other Senators. [1] In October 1989 The Arizona Republic reported that in addition to campaign contributions, McCain's wife and her father had invested $359,100 in a Keating shopping center in April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators. The paper also reported that the McCains, sometimes accompanied by their daughter and baby-sitter, had made at least nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard the American Continental jet. Three of the trips were made during vacations to Keating's opulent Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay. McCain also did not pay Keating for some of the trips until years after they were taken, after he learned that Keating was in trouble over Lincoln.

"Mac, I read your response and need more time to go over it in detail.  Just wanted to let you know I read it.

I will respond to your claim that I'm a media spoon-fed sheeple (sheeperson?).

&gt; You have to understand the ""not liking thing"" is entirely a media construct. Let's take your own view. Can you even justify it? Do think of pictures like this? From this section. That's a media construct.

I don't agree with you here because you've wandered into the area of subjectivity (assuming that there's anything about politics that's *not* subjective).

My intense dislike of Hillary is predicated completely on videos of her speaking.  She makes me cringe.  I couldn't care less what she looks like, honestly.  I care that she sounds completely insincere every time I hear her open her mouth.

The clip where Obama got off his snappy ""I look forward to having you advising me too, Hillary"" was one of the worst.  Her fake laugh, fake smile and the way she said ""I'm looking forward to hearing this too"" just rubbed me the wrong way.  That's only one example that comes to mind but it happens whenever I hear her speak.

Do you have an example of a speech she's given where she sounds sincere?  Maybe I'm just not watching the right stuff.

Also, the fallout for me personally of the Obama d Clinton moment above was that I realized I am just one of the sheeple.  I was thinking ""Wow! He really owned her there!"" until at some point the next day I became deeply sad and disappointed.  I had just let my opinion of who will be the next president be affected by a snappy one liner.  Maybe I should vote for Conan O'Brian?

Anyway, the ""liking"" issue is related to trust with me.  If I cannot believe the things that she says, how can I like her?  I feel like she's lying to me the whole time.

Maybe she's a really sincere person when she speaks to someone one-on-one.

At the time (the 2006 elections which changed the senate majority had not occurred) the Republican majority seemed more than happy to simply reauthorize -- and expand.

"""A thought crime is when I am prosecuted for considering raping somebody."" For someone with the moniker of ""sheeprevolution"" you don't seem to ""get it"" quite yet. Unless that name is sarcastic only. 

A thought crime is based on anything they deem is a crime to be thought about or the action of inducing a line of thinking they deem illegal. Which includes your one example. But so much more. Which is why thought crimes (as in making thoughts and suggesting a line of thought to others, illegal) and even a hint of it is very bad. 

She was ticketed because she was inducing thoughts in people that John ""Hitler's freund"" McCain and his staff didn't like and abused supposed trespassing laws in order to have any difference of thought removed. She was not being violent or forceful at an advertised public event. There is no such thing as a public ""unless we say so to certain  individuals"" event. It is either a public or private event. One or the other. It was advertised as a public event so she, and anyone else should have the right to be there regardless of the condition of the property, to which even the momentary renter has no control over who really is trespassing or not. 

McCain is a part of the regime that will eventually make something like this more than just a ticketable offense, but actual jail time so we are all more afraid of expressing our right to free speech and alternative thinking.

Further, this was a political event. All bets are off at things like this, or should be. It is absolutely not like the example you gave with the bank. Interestingly enough to allow and justify McCain to do this, you have to use a corporate example. Real politicians have the balls to allow for other people to exercise their rights, even if it happens to step on their toes for the moment. Many Obama and McCain supporters protested Ron Paul and he didn't have them removed.

"True story...I almost had it on videotape of my 60 year old stepdad saying he didn't want a 73 year old president (McCain will be near 73 by the time Bush leaves).  Unfortunately, I had stopped the tape earlier to make sure it was rewound all the way and when I thought I restarted it I guess I didn't hit the button good enough.  We're talking about a Texan here, too, born and raised and very proud of it.  Has no problem calling himself a redneck.  Would have been pure gold come general election time.  Unless McCain can figure out a way to reverse time, he'll never make it to the White House.

Some extended family was down, too.  Again, ~60 year old women from Minnesota.  I asked if they'd heard of Ron Paul.  She said ""yeah, I really like him...too bad he dropped out.""  I, of course, informed her he's still running.

Corporate America is the only ""person"" who doesn't want Ron Paul in the White House, it seems.  If Republicans had a clue, they'd throw all their might behind Paul and he'd be a shoe-in.  An Obama/Paul election would be the most exciting this country could ever hope for.  It would be nothing but a competition to see who could break more contribution records.  The best part of that election is that America would end up the winner.  Neither are perfect, by any stretch of the imagination, but both are certainly better than any of the others.

As for me, if Clinton gets the nod I'll vote for Paul, just on principle, even if I have to write him in.  I figure it's a wasted vote anyway. If Obama gets it I'll vote for him just to keep McCain out.  I have a feeling a good majority of Independents subscribe to this very line of reasoning.  

For those trying to say his age is irrelevant when it comes to his ability to lead...you're absolutely right.  But it has absolutely everything to do with him being able to get elected.

"Thanks again for the insult.

I'm not surprised that you found time hide behind someone else rather than attempt to make your own argument.

So let's take this obvious hit piece apart, because you obviously can't be bothered.

&gt;I never dreamed the reason would be ""experience."" More astonishing still, the public seems to be buying it. According to a new New York Times/CBS News poll, 79 percent of all Democratic primary voters believe that Hillary Clinton has ""prepared herself well enough for the job of President,"" compared with only 40 percent for Obama. ""Experience Counts"" declared the headline of a Jan. 9 editorial in the Boston Globe about the New Hampshire victories of Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. ""The results suggest that, at the least, New Hampshire voters put more stock in the length of a candidate's track record than Iowa voters did,"" the Globe said. But the paper never got around to explaining what, in Hillary's case, that experience consisted of.

So what we have hear are reference to the pundit class meme of what the election is about. As explained above. The media has decided that there are 4 categories to classify voter reaction to the candidates, actual reality be damned. And Noah's going to quote the media to reinforce this frame.

It's like Cookie Robers interviewing Jaun Williams. But yeah that's what ""voters"" are thinking.

So let's continue.

Now that we have set up the strawman media creation Noah proceeds to knock it down, and it's easy because it was never true to begin with.

&gt;Let's be clear. If you're a Democrat, experience isn't on this year's menu. The most experienced among the major candidates seeking the Democratic nomination were Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. They have now dropped out. The remaining major candidates—Clinton, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and former Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.—all lack lengthy records in government.

Absolutely true. Which means the ""Experience"" meme as framed by the media is not and has never been what is motivating the Dem base.

And then we raise up some Slate media voices to re-sanctify the strawman.

And finally we get to the main point of the article.

&gt;Where the hell does she come off claiming superior experience? 

...

&gt;I think it is informed by my deep experience over the last 35 years, my firsthand knowledge of what goes on inside a White House.

So what does Noah first focus on. Her claim of firsthand knowledge from being in the Whitehouse for 8 years or the 35 year claim of being involved in politics. Why it's the politics claim.

But not to worry he's going to get back to attacking the White House claim, which is going to basically revolve around relaunching the Patrick Healy article from the New York Times of late December. So at least we can credit Healy with having done some research for his position. Unlike Noah who is just focused on burying the axe, much as was the case with his much of ""journalism"" under teh Slate ""Chatterbox"" banner.

So let's look at the Healy claims which boil down to the fact she was not officially part of the Clinton Policy apparatus. Which makes sense given that she was not elected or appointed. 

But he hits on the real heart of her claim which is not refutable.

&gt;Friends of Mrs. Clinton say that she acted as adviser, analyst, devil’s advocate, problem-solver and gut check for her husband, and that she has an intuitive sense of how brutal the job can be. What is clear, she and others say, is that Mr. Clinton often consulted her, and that Mrs. Clinton gained experience that Mr. Obama, John Edwards and every other candidate lack — indeed, that most incoming presidents did not have.

&gt;“In the end, she was the last court of appeal for him when he was making a decision,” said Mickey Kantor, a close Clinton friend who served as trade representative and commerce secretary. “I would be surprised if there was any major decision he made that she didn’t weigh in on.” (Mr. Clinton declined an interview request.)

But of course who did Healy choose to let refute this reality. Why that would be *Susan Rice, Obama's senior policy advisor*. So we can see what the goal of the article is. We've got Mickey Kantor in the affirmative, who isn't actually with the campaign, vs Susan Rice who is with an opposing campaign.

It's an attempt at balance I guess. So give Healy some points for actually trying some journalism unlike Noah who is essentially acting as a gossip mogerer here.

So what do we have here? Is there any policy discussion at all, about what the candidates will actually do in office? No. This Noah article is all about refuting the ""media perception"" of the campaign. Which is why it's crap.

So what are Hillary's actual claims? That she has been through 8 years in the White House and has a deep understanding of the issues from that perspective and that she has a detailed plan to address the current problems. Absolutely true considering she unlike past first ladies was involved with her husband on policy decisions.

Now the most interesting part of the Noah article is when he attempts to attack her through William Kristol, who claims that no democrat including both Obama and Hillary can recognize the success of the surge. Color me convinced at this earth shaking attack. Bill Kristol's got everyone just where he wants them.

And then he concludes.

&gt;Clinton's claim to superior experience isn't merely dishonest. It's also potentially dangerous should she become the nominee. 

Because wait for it... John ""Iraq forever"" McCain who is being backed by the full host of neo-cons and Joe Lieberman is going to take her apart somehow magically. John McCain who couldn't sucessfully debate with John Stewart is going to flex his superior ""experience"" and win the day.

Wake up yourself. Obama is strongly anti-war. He came to the U.S. Senate after the decision to invade Iraq. Obama supporters like Ron Paul. Both campaigns get great support from military families. Your remarks do not help Ron Paul's cause.,2
"rhmc, I see your point, and I agree. This never could have happened in 1957. A half European, half African, Harvard educated guy like Obama could have never gone as far as he has even 20 years ago. As long as he stays away from fiery Christian rhetoric against war, imperialism, and the rich exploiting the poor, he can govern as a ""moderate Democrat"" like Bill Clinton with not just bombers but ground troops. 

God damn America, that's in the Bible, for killing innocent people. God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America for as long as she acts like she is God and she is supreme.",5

"&gt;Thank god, that most other people in your country aren't as naive in thinking that McCain will not continue the legacy of Bush or that Hillary isn't that influenced by lobbyists.

I have news for you: They are all beholden to  money and influence. It's what makes the world run. 

&gt;Obama is seen by many (from Kenia to Kuala Lumpur) as the guy that will give the USA its friendly face back. Not because he is the lesser of evils as some here propose.

That's great. I bet he's a fun guy to hang out with or have a beer with. But can he be a real leader? Can he make the hard decisions when he has to?

&gt;But because his actions show a certain genuin sincerity. His plans to reconcile with the Islamic World, focus on Afghanistan instead of Iraq are the prime example.

Actions speak louder than words. We'll see.

&gt;All those Ron Paul voters bitching about how he voted about the patriot act, know shit about politics. Politics is everything about the populistic vote. He would be shot down by any campaign if he voted against the patriot act. Its a fact of life, and yes it is a shame you guys let it come this far.

Of course its about populism, that's how people get elected. They tell em' what they want to hear. 

&gt;I love America, but i hate what it has become, Obama gave me the hope to be able look up to this country again with some pride somewhere in november.

You are going to be a sad person when you see business as usual come April 22nd, 2009 (the 100 day grace period Congress usually gives to newly elected Presidents). 

&gt;I really wish you guys won't fuck this up. Not only because I really enjoy traveling within America and the current government really took some of the joy out of this. But also because I think you guys have some big problems to face such as recession and corruption which you need to deal with quick in order not to end up like some of the banana republics you guys are now bullying.

Fucking up is relative and there is corruption everywhere. Some places more than others.

"&gt;Obama sides with Georgia, but takes a more diplomatic stance and is carefully to not vilify Russia…http://donklephant.com/2008/08/09/georgia-russia-and-the-candidates-diplomatic-style/

&gt;    “I strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in Georgia, and urge an immediate end to armed conflict,” Obama said in a written statement. “Now is the time for Georgia and Russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full-scale war. Georgia’s territorial integrity must be respected.”

&gt;    Obama added briefly that the international community should get involved. More than an hour later, as more details of Russia’s incursion into Georgia emerged, he cited Russia more directly: “What is clear is that Russia [...] has encroached on Georgia’s sovereignty,” he told reporters in Sacramento.

He may have been more diplomatic about it, but he was still very much on Georgia's side. He's even suggesting that Russia not be allowed to join the WTO (not that it's a bad thing as the WTO is horrid) and wants to take even other diplomatic measures against Russia.

Watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D-QMjH5rCM",1
"&gt; He needs to say that continuing the Iraq war will yield no results, will hurt America, will do a great disservice to the troops that are serving, and will not increase the security of America in any way.

Obama will never say this, because he wants to move those troops straight over to Afghanistan. So he can't say how he doesn't think war is good business, because he supports increasing the military budget and number of troops. Obama's only message is that Iraq was the wrong war, not that war is bad.",3
"I don't follow British politics a whole lot, but yeah, I don't see a significant difference in approach by Miliband, Cameron, or Brown.

In our case, taking the Georgian situation as a litmus test, we've seen a strong difference in approach between Obama and McCain.  It's frankly been a long time since I've actually seen a demonstrable difference on our side of the pond.",1

"Even if you could convince anybody who even saw you to vote for Obama, chances are none of them would have the vote that actually matters.",1
"&gt; The US government likes to gain power. The only way it can do that is if the voters allow it. The Christian vote is one of the most powerful.

This is true.

&gt; I think Obama was trying to make the case that it is foolish to govern with Christian law....So playing on Christian issues is an easy way to win public support (and power).

At first glance, I would think the same thing. I'm probably just over-thinking why Obama would make such a speech and he most likely did it solely to make a speech and have people hear him speaking. Thats what politicians do best is talk.

&gt; I think fundamentally the government is meant to represent our views, but the church is not.

This is what I'll disagree with you on. I think the classic problem with government is that they attempt to gather power endlessly. Unless there is a mechanism to stop this assumption, then they will eventually become a totalitarian regime and collapse. Therefore, I submit that most *successful* governments have been opposed by something to limit this power. The church has typically servered this role.

So is a church anything other than a smaller division of government? If you and I gather in a room weekly to discuss things, isn't that a form of democratic government? Expanding this to encompass thousands of like minded people, is just a larger ""representation of our views"". 

So church is really just an informal style of government. Instead of borders being drawn on a map, the borders are drawn by beliefs and can cross physical borders. This is why I think traditional governments have always hated the power of religion.

So was Obama trying to fight religion to gather more power to him? I think in the context of history, the answer would be yes, but that was likely not his personal intention.",1
"Agreed, though I would be among the group that would not be willing to have Ron Paul tear us to pieces to save us.  Would rather have Obama, who though disappointing to many on the far left, is by no means a warmonger.  ",0
"Tone it down, shorty. The original question was simply, 'Why are you a pro-Hillary guy'; the simple answer: I think she'll make a better president. No need for the snark.

As to your question, I have shown my work repeatedly on Reddit; clicking on my name would have brought you to my past comments. 

The crux: I like both candidates, but I am simply not turned on by the 'hope' angle as many other people are. Hope tends to disappoint, particularly when dealing with politicians. And Obama is most definitely a politician.

I see in Hillary someone who can get things done. Someone who we've all seen will not take no for an answer. That's leadership to me.

As for Obama, to quote an earlier post: ""I look at Obama and worry about the Carter syndrome: A good man with some decent ideas was stonewalled at every turn by an unfriendly congress reasserting itself in the aftermath of a dreadful presidency. You see any parallels?""

"They don't really have wacky beliefs. Heck, their beliefs are standard globalism.

The problem with the CFR is that group of people thinks that globalism is *more important* than the sovereignty of individual nations, and they would happily sell the US Government down the river to create a North American super-state out of Canada, Mexico, and the USA. They aren't interested in your jobs, your businesses, your health care plans. They are interested in efficiently harnessing all of the resources (natural, people, investment capital, military etc) of North America. If it means you suffer so they can do that, then they'll let you suffer. No compassion.

I have nothing against globalism really, it's a good idea. It should however come about by choice, not by relentless political and economic agendas designed to benefit this ""NAU"" at the expense of the USA's own best interests.

I did actually do the research. The CFR isn't some nefarious cloak &amp; dagger organization and they think they do good work. They aren't crazy like Scientology for example. It's just a rich boys &amp; politicians club.

Obama is a member. Frankly I don't know what to make of him. He seems like quite a good guy, even if he has some rather silly socialist ideas (like all democrats). An Obama presidency would hardly be a disaster. I just hope he's got the willpower to prevent Washington (and his CFR friends who will be all over him if he makes President) from changing him. That's why we like Ron - the man does not change. Obama is anyone's guess...

There's no need to vote for Obama, either. If the RNC snubs Ron, he'll probably go 3rd party again. That'll be sufficient to prevent Republicans from ever winning.

If Obama adopted Ron Paul's foreign policy &amp; economic policy, I'd vote for him. The importance of those issues trumps everything else.",5

These guys have background checks done at every level -- Junior Senator, Senator, Presidential Candidate, President-Elect -- you think maybe the secret service and FBI have had a little look at him yet? On top of that HE'S RELEASED A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT YOU'RE ASKING HIM TO RELEASE. It's valid in court, but not in your head? Now, if you can provide a shred of reliable evidence to even suggest that he WASN'T born in Hawaii, as the copy of his birth certificate says, maybe then you'd have a point.

"Assuming the story is true, here's the importance of this story:  It evidences Obama's instincts as an honest guy.  He was at least somewhat adverse to Richardson, and when presented with a split-second opportunity to either help him out of a tough spot, or let him squirm, he chose to help him out.  
Now you can say this is clever politics, but it's only clever on Richardson's part because it ingratiates him with Obama.  Obama, until now, has derived no benefit from what happened and absent this random quote from Richardson and its subsequent posting on Reddit, probably never would have.  Maybe Obama isn't a nice/good/honest person, but this, assuming its accuracy, is some pretty unadulterated evidence that he is.",18
"I'm not sure I get the line your drawing here. I really don't like Hillary. I remember the crash and burn that was the push for Universal Health Care, the descent into the morass that was travel gate, and I could go on and on. I feel strongly that she can unify a fragmented opposition and the first of a long string of scandals would start no more than 6 months into her administration. I believe she says the right things, and says them very well but stands only for herself. None of my feelings for her have anything to do with the fact that she's a woman. Though I have heard a lot of c*nts, and bitches in reference to her it's in the minority. Most of the 'demonizing' I've seen comes from people who don't like her for who she is and what she's done. 

You disagree but have treated the people debating with you with respect. That's something Obama and Clinton supporters have not done.

"Does she have *any* political experience short of organizing protests/Gold Star Families for Peace? Something that could compete against the speaker of the house, who has been re-elected to the house 10 times? I realize she has progressive values, but that's not enough to get elected, even in a 'liberal' district.

I'm genuinely interested, since this sort of info seems to be lacking on her site. I don't count ""Church Youth Minister"" as relevant experience. She doesn't need to be an insider, but maybe vice president of a college, or city board member, or better yet, state senator.

I feel that even if I disagree with a candidate a bit, as long as they have a moral compass and a logical and evidence-based method for making decisions (ie. general competence), then they do well. Our current administration is immoral and incompetent. Obama seems to be a centrist, but he seems balanced and moral enough to be a successful president. Cindy Sheehan may be moral, but she hasn't had to prove her competence yet.

I apologize for being so harsh, but when one requests money with an apparently impossible promise in return, I'm cautious.

note: To make matters worse, Sheehan doesn't even live in Pelosi's district, so while she legally can run for it, she'll already be at a disadvantage on that front...",10
"""Obama has not disclosed who really wrote his so-called autobiography, ""Dreams From My Father,"" but a comparison of his speaking with that book indicates the unlikelihood that he wrote it.

What are you willing to sacrifice for the betterment of society? Do you really think that implementing 100% liberal-based laws and plans would solve everyone's problems, while you and everyone sit around waiting for the reward?

However, he's also got some faith that government CAN do good things for people. Paul, on the other hand, would just as soon throw all that out the window and hope churches can make up the difference.

Neither candidate's perfect! We get it! But I promise you this: most Obama and Paul supporters aren't the ones who need to be educated on the candidates' policies and principles; it's the Clinton, Romney, McCain, and Fuckabee supporters that need it. So direct your time and energy toward them. ",40

Obama gifted her the money because she was in a bad situation and he's a nice guy.  There's no reason to think that your interpretation is any more valid than mine.

"&gt;If reporting is proportional to votes, then he didn't receive even his fair share.

Uhh... yeah. He did. Before McCain secured the nomination and everyone else dropped out, they were all getting *far* more votes and polling *far* higher than Paul. He was getting at *least* as much attention as his polling numbers and vote count warranted. 

&gt;You're not forced to use the delegate system. You can use the votes received and you even linked to them, so you have used something other than delegates. You're getting far-fetched now.

But even if we look at the votes received, McCain's numbers dwarf Paul's. Romney's numbers dwarf Paul's. Even Huckabees numbers dwarf Paul's.

Far fetched is the idea that a nobody representative with no charisma, a very small political record, and old, re-hashed, and unpopular ideas about how government should be run could even come close to winning a nomination for presidency.

&gt;Winning a popularity contest doesn't ensure the best results.

But... but... aren't we (supposedly) a Democracy? Our whole government is based on winning popularity contests. You have to get the majority of people to vote for you, by whatever means you can. That's the definition of Democracy. Do I think some voters are poorly informed and vote based on hype? Yep. Do I think they should? Nope. It doesn't matter what I think, though. If I were the majority, things would be run a lot differently.

&gt;So again, he was nothing special, except being a token black man (with a good speaking voice).

But being a token black man with a good speaking voice gets attention. It doesn't matter whether or not you feel he did anything to deserve it. **YOU HAVE TO GET ATTENTION** in order to win an election. Ron Paul has proven incapable of this. Once you have that attention, the stuff you are saying, whether in a good speaking voice or not, has to interest people enough to keep them coming back for more.

Until we implement a system where we have to vote on policies alone, and don't ever get to see or hear the candidates, Ron Paul stands no chance of doing anything but sitting and writing bills in Texas.

I'm not saying it's a good system. I'm not arguing that it's my preferred system. I'm not saying that I think it's right to vote based on how someone looks or how well they speak in public. It is, however, the system we're stuck with.

If you want your boy Paul to win, either he has to adapt to the system, or the system needs to be changed. If neither of those things happen, he will continue to be ignored.

&gt;What? I take it you know nothing about Paul or the Republican candidates.

I did my research on the Republican candidates, got sick to my stomach, and moved on. I checked out Paul's legislative record. About the same as Obama's or Clinton's or McCain's. Nothing special. He voted for the ideas he liked, and voted against the ideas he didn't like.

&gt;You have demonstrated your perception that media attention = some form of significant contribution. 

No. I never said significant contribution. I said significant impact on American politics. That just may be through a significant contribution, but it also might be through something trivial like being a black guy with a good speaking voice.

&gt;I've used your definition. You said it was ""intentionally ignoring""

I don't know why you have such a hard time with this. Since the first definition I used, I said:

&gt;Marginalized = intentionally ignored just because the media doesn't like him / has a personal vendetta against him

You kept cropping out everything after ""intentionally ignored"", as you have done again here. That is not my definition.

&gt;then you changed it to ""overlooking""

I never changed my definition of ""marginalized"" to ""overlooking"". I replaced ""ignoring"" with ""overlooking"" when comparing the difference between ""marginalized"" and ""ignored due to lack of popularity"". Ultimately, the comparison that I was making was ""intentionally ignored just because the media doesn't like him / has a personal vendetta against him"", or ""marginalized"", to ""overlooked due to lack of popularity"", or ""ignored"".

&gt;and then you tried to attach a context of justification to the meaning.

Yes, because I had to explain why I felt that the media was justified in their lack of coverage of Ron Paul, in order to explain why I didn't feel he was being ""marginalized"".

&gt;What dictionary is backing you up?

Like I said a few posts back... www.dictionary.com. I posted their definition for ""marginalize"" and for ""marginal"". Feel free to refer back to it.

Since then, I have been defending why I think in order to be marginalized, you have to be in a position of higher importance in order to be placed in a position of lower importance. You can't start in a position of lower importance and be marginalized. Does this seriously not ring a bell?

&gt;Considering the support he had on the internet, he did elevate himself up.

As his poll results, vote count, and primary / caucus results all prove, support on the internet does not equal support in real life. If support on the internet meant anything in the real world, Chuck Norris, Rick Astley, and Mr. Splashy Pants would the front runners for president right now.

&gt;Polls were manipulated and justifications fabricated in anyway possible to not mention his name even in the CNN pie charts!

Which polls and which pie charts exactly?

&gt;Your messiah Obama is merely a puppet of current establishment.

"In most presidential elections, the selection of a vice presidential candidate does not make a lot of difference to me, and it probably does not matter to most interested citizens.

This year, however, we have a presidential candidate who has close to zero credentials, running on a mantra of change. Change we probably won't believe, if we ever see it.

Barack Obama won't tell us what he is going to change, and whether the change will be good change or bad change.

He selected Sen. Joe Biden who has 36 years in Washington as a senator. How's that for change?

The ticket can claim almost 40 years of Washington senatorial experience, but neither the top of the ticket nor the second spot has any executive or leadership experience.

The other major candidate is a born leader who doesn't mind making people mad. John McCain makes me mad sometimes, too.

While I disagree with him more than I would like in my candidate, I have tremendous respect for his character and military leadership experience.

I was somewhat lukewarm toward his candidacy, and I was going to vote for him as a vote against the alternative.

McCain's selection of Sarah Palin is a bold move and is indicative of positive change.

This pick has solidified my support. It shows me he is listening to middle America, which is basically hardworking and conservative.

From what I know so far, Palin is one of us. She lives her life conservatively, loves her family unconditionally and has leadership qualities that the Democrat opponents cannot claim.

Most of us can relate to the family issues she is facing, and we can cheer her on as she continues to press forward while dealing with them.

The more the media try to trash her, the more Americans will relate to Palin and rally around her, as they recognize their values and beliefs are being trashed along with hers.",-2

In addition, we on reddit are fairly well informed when it comes to the current candidates, there policies, and the debates.  Outside of college and these internet communities, i really don't know that many people who bother to read up on politics.  It is the average 9-5 workers that i am fairly well acquainted with who seem to care the least, since they feel that none of the policies affect them all that much.  Both the poor and the rich have something significant to either gain or lose and spend at least a little bit of time checking up on current debates.  The 9-5'ers that i know will probably vote along party lines.

"Full quote:

OBAMA: So, it depends on where you are, but I think it's fair to say that the places where we are going to have to do the most work are the places where people feel most cynical about government. The people are mis-appre...I think they're misunderstanding why the demographics in our, in this contest have broken out as they are. Because everybody just ascribes it to 'white working-class don't wanna work -- don't wanna vote for the black guy.' That's...there were intimations of that in an article in the Sunday New York Times today - kind of implies that it's sort of a race thing.

Here's how it is: in a lot of these communities in big industrial states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, people have been beaten down so long, and they feel so betrayed by government, and when they hear a pitch that is premised on not being cynical about government, then a part of them just doesn't buy it. And when it's delivered by -- it's true that when it's delivered by a 46-year-old black man named Barack Obama (laugher), then that adds another layer of skepticism (laughter).

But -- so the questions you're most likely to get about me, 'Well, what is this guy going to do for me? What's the concrete thing?' What they wanna hear is -- so, we'll give you talking points about what we're proposing -- close tax loopholes, roll back, you know, the tax cuts for the top 1 percent. Obama's gonna give tax breaks to middle-class folks and we're gonna provide health care for every American. So we'll go down a series of talking points.

But the truth is, is that, our challenge is to get people persuaded that we can make progress when there's not evidence of that in their daily lives. You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not. So it's not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.

Um, now these are in some communities, you know. I think what you'll find is, is that people of every background -- there are gonna be a mix of people, you can go in the toughest neighborhoods, you know working-class lunch-pail folks, you'll find Obama enthusiasts. And you can go into places where you think I'd be very strong and people will just be skeptical. The important thing is that you show up and you're doing what you're doing.",10

Whatever facts you cite of Rahm Emanuel's past does not mean that Obama's anointment of him as Chief of Staff *guarantees* a pro-Israeli agenda. While there is reasonable room to be curious, this assumption that it that Obama himself is for the war or actively backing Isreali concerns is insane. This line of reasoning that a man's religion and allegiance to it somehow undermines his duty to the USA is an ancient one and has been used against Kennedy for being Catholic and representing ""Papist"" ideas. I see no difference and I believe a man such as Rahm Emanuel will choose what is right from the United States of America instead of Israel. Assumptions such as Emanuel being for the war *because he is sympathetic to Israel* is unfounded. Your proof of him as being a ""hardcore Zionist"" is anecdotal and biased.",-1

""Though Gov. Palin originally supported the earmark spending on the Ketchikan bridge (“to nowhere), SHE eventually KILLED THE PROJECT, choosing to spend Federal money on other infrasturcture programs.

However, Sen. Biden and Sen. Obama voted FOR funding the Bridge, EVEN when given a second chance by Sen. Tom Coburn, who proposed shifting earmark funds to Katrina relief.

Sen. McCain did not vote on the Coburn Amendment, though he is ON RECORD AS OPPSOING the Ketchikan bridge earmark.""

"&gt; Would you argue that a politician who ends a speech with ""God bless America"" owes somebody credit for the line?

The argument is that Obama gives great speeches that are empty of substance. He clearly has taken proven and effective speech material from other sources. This is obviously a good practice, because taking bad speech material would be stupid.

So the question becomes are people convinced that Obama is a good politician because he gives a good speech or because he has workable solutions? You've just admitted that he has good speech material. Therefore no matter what, part of the support given to Obama is because of this speech material. 

This is the accusation that you claimed was empty. You just admitted that it wasn't empty. It might be a very small aspect in your opinion and very high in my opinion, but it is not empty.",1

Really? Do you have a link to a superdelegate announcing his support and then at the same time disclosing the prior financial support from Obama? I doubt it. More likely you're referring to the fact that people can research this disclosure if they're interested. Well, I'm sure the same holds true for the money given to these ward bosses , people can lookup the donations made to them in the same fashion.

&gt; The Philadelphia situation is an explicit quid pro quo.

agreed, but then you're promoting the idea that politics should not be a common mans activity and subtlety is the name of the game. Lets keep the discussion simple and state that money changes hands during political campaigning.

&gt; No, at its worst you think it would be considered astroturfing. At least, that's what you said.

Astroturfing is marketing. Its an attempt to make people think a candidate is more popular than he really is. There is nothing illegal about, but it is deceptive. All marketing is deceptive though.

&gt; We agree that the Philadelphia campaign workers are like astroturfers. Campaign staffers generally are not.

My point really was that paying supporters to canvass for a candiate makes them more of a campaign worker than a volunteer. If Obama had to pay a real marketing company to hand out flyers for a day, would you call them astroturf as well? No, they'd just be temporary campaign workers.

Obama has ""paid"" student volunteers with daily lunches and open facilities. Without these offerings there might be fewer volunteers. In the past he likely paid $10+ to offer these things to students, whereas in Philadelphia they just wanted the cash.

So I think your point is that things should be done in a more subtle fashion. Instead of giving a student $20 to pass out flyers, buy them a $20 lunch. Instead of buying a superdeleagte's vote, plan ahead and buy him early enough.",-1

&gt; One has a careful review of policy and legislation, the other shoots-without-thinking

Is this based on McCain's obvious lack of ability in the public speaking arena?  This is exactly what I'm asking about.  What are the *actual* differences in their policy and legislation?

&gt; One is interested in the middle class, health care and education. The other isn't.

Ok, this one is interesting.  While not quite on topic, I've consistently been intrigued by the fact that reddit seems to think that rich people actually pay *earned* income tax.  This is pretty much demonstrably not true.  The increase above the 250K mark will have, essentially, no impact on the ""rich.""  I'd be pretty shocked if any of these CEOs pay has been W-2.  I mean, these guys are good at money... that's why their rich.  They're not going to go for paying 50-60% income tax (right now) on their salary if they can get away with paying capital gains tax instead.  So, I'd tend to say that the people who will actually be impacted by the &gt; $250K tax increase really will be small businesses.  

As for health care, I don't really know enough about it.  I've looked all around for reliable statistics to back up either candidate and can't find any.

As for education, what are the differences here?  In the debate I heard a lot of agreeing and a little bit of disagreeing about ""vouchers.""  That's about all I've actually heard on the topic.

&gt; One has a better ability to balance the budget and set us on a course away from oil, the other has no idea

I'd like to hear more on this.  Hasn't the one who ""has no idea"" also supported all the same energy stuff in addition to nuclear?  Another obvious difference is the offshore drilling, which I'm not real clear on the pros and cons of this...  Are  you?



I'm really trying to figure this out because I doubt it's all as simple as the debates/reddit seems to make it out to be.  I'm always surprised by the level of expertise in various subjects that shows up on reddit, so I thought I'd ask. 

I'd like to vote for someone who could actually win this time...

"FTFA entitled ""Obama Narrowly Leads McCain in AP Poll"" here is the only paragraph to mention Ron Paul.

In addition, he was backed by only three in 10 white evangelical and born again Christians and just four in 10 conservatives - pivotal parts of the GOP.

And here is the margin of error.

&gt;Included were 520 Democrats, for whom the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4.3 points, and 357 Republicans, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.2 points.

"&gt; ...you'd need something like four times that much to buy it.

That would be undervaluing the business he purportedly wants to buy, as the typical valuation is 7 years gross (which aligns with the conventional rule of thumb that a P/E between 6 and 8 is a good value).

&gt; It sounds like you would have to own a business that had over $250k in net revenues in order to see a tax increase.

That's far too low a threshold. Even small business capital improvements can run up a large tab exceeding that limit very quickly, so these types of limits only serve to hammer small businesses that are trying to set aside cash for future expansion or reserves. Consider: even a very small operation of 8 employees at $30K W-2 wages (at least $40K fully burdened) would find a $250K windfall in a year a temporary reprieve from the cash flow wolves at best. A prudently managing owner would only view that windfall as a way to secure against future economic volatility in his business, if he didn't already have a rainy day fund. It would buy him at best 10-12 months of breathing room in zero sales time in case of something that cuts into his company's sales.

You would be amazed how long it takes to re-position a company. It can easily take 6-8 months (say 3-4 months in zero sales time) to realize there is a need to change, and most business owners don't even figure that out that quickly. Figuring out what to do next, winding down the current sales, then starting up in the new business would easily take the remaining amount of time, and then some, and we haven't even started discussing what it would cost to enter a different market and spin-up/incubation costs.

If on the other hand you just booked the twentieth year of $250K free cash flow, then a lot of small business owners would call the aggregate ""safe retirement"". Stick that aggregate into laddered Treasuries and retire off the interest payments. In reality, vanishingly few small businesses rack up that kind of free cash flow for that long, that consistently. So you usually end up with about 5 out of 20 years where the business hits that kind of windfall, at best, and that becomes the retirement fund for the owners.

The vast majority of Redditors don't own or run the fiscal side of a business and never will, so it is entirely understandable that they would think Obama is very generous setting a $250K net revenue target as the definition of ""rich"". If you really want to ""soak the rich"", the ones who are truly rich are the ones who live off of capital gains and/or interest throwing off payments equal to or greater than that net revenue target, not the ones trying to put income to work or save for their future retirement. There are problems with taxing capital gains or interest as well, but that is a discussion for another day.

If America wants an actual, sustainable solution, then addressing the expenditure side has to come ahead of any mention or discussion of taxation policy.",2

So much for that constitution and bill of rights. 

He is pure establishment - his wife is a director of the chicago CFR, hes adopted the foreign policy of the anti russian, anti american Zbigniew Brzezinski, whos said that Americans have had it good for too long. Zbig is also the creator of Al Qaeda - the enemy Obama will chase and invade whatever country they go in, Bush style, just like the plan was all along.

When it suits him he calls Hillary Annie Oakley and pretends there's some contradiction in being for gun rights but for control on assault weapons.  When it suits him he has his supporters (this is reflected in leaked memos) call Bill a racist, etc. etc.

"The full quote is:

&gt; Obama will work to give parents the tools to prevent reception of programming that they find offensive on television and on digital media. On privacy, Obama will call for the creation of what he calls “Public Media 2.0.” While vague on details, campaign managers said Obama hopes to bring Tivo-like technologies so parents can ensure safe TV viewing. Obama also wants to raise sanctions against companies offering indecent – violent or sexually explicit – content.

So it appears to something vague to do with TV. This one very nonspecific  point (the shortest paragraph on the page) is a mark against him, but he does well on other tech issues. I find it hard to believe that he will be a Meese-like blowhard. I suspect that this is pablum for the parental masses.

More is here: http://www.barackobama.com/issues/technology/

&gt; Obama will encourage improvements to the existing voluntary rating system, exploiting new technologies like tagging and filtering, so that parents can better understand what content their children will see, and have the tools to respond. Private entities like Common Sense Media are pursuing a “sanity not censorship” approach, which can serve as a model for how to use technology to empower parents without offending the First Amendment.

McCain took a cheap shot at Obama by implying that he is undermining the troops, and he kept talking about what's important is an overall strategy and to listen to the generals and that Iraq is the front line of the war on terror. Of course he didn't come out and detail what his strategy is (he probably doesn't have one that extends much beyond his commitment to stay in Iraq).

Obama needs to stand up for himself and for the American people if he wants to win this election. He needs to say that continuing the Iraq war will yield no results, will hurt America, will do a great disservice to the troops that are serving, and will not increase the security of America in any way. He needs to be calling McCain what he is - A disengaged war mongrel whose policies are detrimental to America and the world as a whole.

Second, that the distribution of superdelegates would not change.  These assumptions can be argued, of course, but I think they're pretty reasonable.

So from the numbers I used, before PA, Hillary needed 511 of 875 available delegates, or 58.4%.  Since the proportion of PA delegates she won was less than 58.4%, the proportion of delegates she needs must go up.  More precisely, she now needs 430 of 725 available delegates, or 59.3%.

Now, I'm sure that different numbers can be found on the internet, and the PA numbers are still changing, etc. but I'm extremely confident that the point will hold with any numbers used.

As for NC and IN, Hillary now needs more than 59.3% of the available delegates on that day to TRULY gain ground.",10

"Since I don't have an account there, to answer the question, the best attributes that Clinton had was that he appeared to have the ability to put himself in someone elses shoes, to feel how and what they would feel.  The way he would pierce into the eyes of the questionee.  And not turn his back so readily after it was answered.  The second thing he did that everyone is amazed about (though not difficult (and not to say Obama should be a Clinton clone) is that on many questions, he visibily put his head down (composed himself) took a couple of seconds visibly to show that he was taking the question seriously, pensively (even if he already had a rehearsed response) and then answered.  It gave the appearance that he was cognitively analyzing and had the ability to answer the question (even when the question backed him into a corner at times).  People took that as he would lead with thoughtful care in the unexpected decisions that may arise if he were president.  He also rarely studdered as he uncannily focused into a compassionate attack mode that made the response smooth as silk as if to say I'm throwing everything into the response and here it is.

Most importantly the way he turned his opponents strength into a weaknesss, like the experience argument, just because you have it, doesn't mean its the right kind.  There are good and bad experiences.  The experience of meeting people on a daily basis and hearing their story.  The experience rooted in the American spirit, that's the experience that makes a president.

I found Clinton's rhetoric predicable and boring at times in the sense he would put on an actor like display of emotion with not a lot of arguable substance.  The little facts he did use he used from every angle though.  Though you could sense his BS and ingenuous manner.

That all being said, Obama sticking with a unified core message, then adding substance that matters to the more diversified groups of today is what hits home, not Clinton's overuse of an emotional plea that I feel you.

Obama is a great way for the US to redeem themselves over Bush and the Republican Party. A smart, coherent, articulate man who with his trips overseas visiting foreign heads of state looks like he acknowledges that the US isn't the be all and end all of the world. There are other countries too.

I'm twenty-seven years old.  I am white.  None of my vote for Obama had anything to do with race, an still the race issue to me only comes up when other people bring it up.  To me, he was a man applying for a job.  In fact, I was praying he would run for president before he announced his candidacy, so he was a job prospect I was vying for.

So... to see people saying they would vote against him solely because he was black, to see people being overjoyed that he could achieve this because he is black, to see the popular vote so close when this was such a no-brainer... that was hard.

Almost everyone I know has dated someone of another race.  It seems every white person I know has at least one black friend, and most black people I know have lots of white friends.

"I'm not sure I understand your point about it being hypocritical for Paul supporters to support Obama. The consistent principle these people are exercising is pragmatism. We believed there was a small but very real possibility of getting Paul elected. Now we believe that window of opportunity has passed, and we believe that of the remaining candidates who have a real shot at winning, Obama is the best. Which is not to say we think Obama is good, just that he's the lesser evil. He also seems like a relatively admirable and nice guy so we try to abstain from referring to him as the ""lesser evil"" even though we believe that's what he is.

The most powerful effect of Paul being president, I believe, would be the influence he woudl wield on the bully pulpit. He would have an enormous ability to educate and inform people in exactly the same way he has educated and informed so many of those who are now his supporters, many of whom didn't previously understand fundamental notions of individual liberty, limited government, economic issues, of the inherent tyranny of taxation and majority-rule, etc.

When the people are better-educated, that's what shifts the political power. Paul has done more than change people's opinions. He's inspired people to self-educate and better understand the principles that this country was so wisely founded on. Paul is an anti-ignorance pill. I know a lot of people who think semi-socialism is still the way to go, but who have acknowledged that they didn't really understand the flipside of socialism and of other issues they support, and they credit Paul for making them more aware of that. I know people who still believe we should have socialized medicine but who now understand and respect the argument against it, where they would previously have just had the normal knee-jerk reaction that liberals have to ""conservative"" ideas.

Also let's not forget that Paul would have the all-important powers of command-in-chief and of veto power. Can you imagine anyone that would make better use of the veto power than Paul? As Bush has demonstrated (one of the few things I give him legitimate credit for), veto power gives you a strong ability to shape the agenda of congress, and also forces more bipartisanship in congress.

Also, with respect to your point about corporations becoming more powerful. I don't want to get into a huge debate about that right now, but it's worth noting at least one exception to that rule: the military industry, whose size is largely controlled by the President. If Paul brings troops home from 90% of the countries we're in, closes tons of bases, etc, and slashes the military budget by, say, 80%, that industry will become less powerful, not more (excepting their ability to do business with the militaries of other countries)",1

"I actually got this idea from /b/, if you can believe it. The original question was a bit more rude (obviously), but the effect was the same.

Using only Obama's own attributes and policies and history, explain why America should vote for him.

You must make the case without comparing him to McCain or Republicans.

I don't follow politics much, so I hope to learn some concrete things about what Obama actually believes, because increasingly this race has become about bashing the other side rather than supporting your own.

PS: It would be fair to make a post like this for McCain, but I feel like that's pointless on reddit.",1
"Neither, if they're both as bad as they were.

You're claiming that a vote against the bad bill would be a vote for the even worse bill.  This seems based on very tenuous logic.

Let's consider:  call the bad bill ""B,"" and the very bad bill ""VB.""

First, let's say that Obama votes in favor of B, exactly as he did in reality.  In this situation, B, the bad bill, passes as long as enough other Senators agree with Obama.

Now let's instead say that Obama votes against B.  What happens?  Well, if Obama is the only Senator brave enough to oppose B, then B still passes by a landslide.  Obama has voted with integrity.  He has done the right thing.  The bad bill, B, unfortunately passed.  The very bad bill, VB, is not considered now because it's a redundant alternative.

On the other hand, if enough people join Obama's opposition vote, B **fails** to pass.  So, that is one victory: the bad bill, B, has been shot down.  Next comes a vote for VB!  Do you seriously think all of those Senators who joined Obama to oppose B are going to now turn around and vote in favor of VB?

(Yes, there are situations where one bloc will vote initially solely as a ruse so they can switch sides later, but basing your support of Obama's votes on a retroactive guess about this possibly happening is like reasoning about trials in Wonderland.)

So, ultimately, Obama could have voted to oppose both B and VB.  Most likely, this either would have had no effect on the outcome, or would have had the effect of preventing both bills' passage.",1

HONOLULU — The state’s Department of
Health director on Friday released a
statement verifying the legitimacy of Sen.
Barack Obama birth certificate.

The state has received multiple requests
for a copy of Obama’s birth certificate.
State law does not allow officials to
release the birth certificate of a person
to someone outside of the family. ...

“There have been numerous requests for
Sen. Barack Hussein Obama’s official birth
certificate. State law (Hawai‘i Revised
Statutes §338-18) prohibits the release of
a certified birth certificate to persons
who do not have a tangible interest in the
vital record,” DOH Director Dr. Chiyome
Fukino said.

“Therefore, I as Director of Health for
the State of Hawai‘i, along with the
Registrar of Vital Statistics who has
statutory authority to oversee and
maintain these type of vital records, have
personally seen and verified that the
Hawai‘i State Department of Health has
Sen. Obama’s original birth certificate on
record in accordance with state policies
and procedures. No state official,
including Governor Linda Lingle, has ever
instructed that this vital record be
handled in a manner different from any
other vital record in the possession of
the State of Hawai‘i,” Fukino said.",3

Not only this would have proved his real value as a leader, but it would point to where no one should go in this campaign.

"America isn't scared. It is scary, and incidents like this only convince the rest of the world that America is the predominant source of global problems rather than a source of solutions and help.  The vast majority of Americans, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama included, do not even remotely question the right of their nation to inflict whatever carnage and suffering it deems necessary on other nations/peoples. It doesn't matter if the act of violence is as seemingly insignificant as an American cargo ship attacking a much smaller, unarmed Egyptian vessel or if it is as obvious as the invasion and occupation of Iraq, the end result is the same: it shows that Americans don't value non-American lives and that the US, as a nation, does not feel obligated to follow the standards of behavior it expects and demands (quite frequently and aggressively, in the case of countries like Iran) from other nations.  If this same incident had occured in the Persian Gulf, with the American ship being attacked instead, the US would be at war within 48 hours, and nobody would even be bothering to argue about warning horns and flares and how justified the other ship's action may have been.

"McCain has pretty much no redeeming qualities left. In 2000, the story was completely different. He showed himself to have an independent streak, combined with a generally conservative fiscal outlook and an overall more centrist point of view than Bush. All that stuff is completely gone now. Bush/Rove broke him like a horse. Since 2000, he has lost his independent streak by hewing tightly to the Bush party line. He has abandoned fiscal responsibility. Oh sure, he plays the ""Obama will raise your taxes and redistribute your wealth"" card, but if you watched the debates, you'd have noticed that his positions are really no different. Pretty much the whole time, _neither_ candidate said ""no"" to any proposition involving more spending. 

Although McCain initially opposed the stupid and expensive medicare prescription drug plan, he is not proposing eliminating it now that he may be in the position to do so. Overall, he proposes a substantial amount of new spending, and is more likely to keep us in obligations (Iraq war, Afghanistan war) that are absolutely hemorrhaging money. 

And of course, he has lurched to the right on social issues, especially by packing Palin. Pretty much his whole social platform is bad and dangerous, and McCain-circa-2000 would've strongly criticized it!

And most importantly, he seems to have lost the honesty and integrity (or at least the veneer thereof) that brought him so much support from moderates and independents in 2000. 

As someone who would've been strongly inclined to vote McCain in 2000, had the Republican leadership been smart enough to nominate him, I have been nothing but disappointed by him since then.

As for why people would vote for him. Well, they fall into a few categories:

1) The apolitical. These people don't follow politics all that closely. They remember the ""good McCain"" from 2000, and haven't really been keeping track of how drastically his platform has shifted since then.

2) The partisan. These people always vote Republican, because their parents always voted Republican. The fact that the last Republican President that actually held to traditional Republican principles was Nixon has not really dawned on these people yet. 

3) The bigots. There are of course the 'big B' bigots, with the confederate flags on their bumper stickers, but there are also 'little B' bigots. You might not even notice their bigotry unless you look closely, or you happen to be non-white or non-Christian. These are people who will be perfectly nice to you, but then freely admit that they think you're going to be punished for eternity because you don't believe what they believe. They will be polite and tolerant of people who are different from them, but will never be able to consider such people ""one of them"". They won't shout racial epithets at Obama, but will never be able to think of ""someone like him"" representing ""people like themselves"". 

This category encompasses not just the most vocal wingnuts, but large portions of the Republican base. 

4) The brain-washed. There is a large overlap between this category and the previous one, but this group shows some particular distinctions. This group tends to focus on ""single issues"", and have largely been indoctrinated to believe that the Republican party will best-support those positions. Some people believe that Republicans will always cut spending and Democrats will always increase it, even though over the last 50 years, Democrats have tended to limit federal budget growth while Republicans have tended to drastically increase it. Others believe that Democrats will always increase their taxes, while Republicans will lower them. Others believe that Republicans will overturn Roe v Wade, while Democrats will encourage people to get abortions. Others are just wingnuts who think ""God"" wants them to vote for the candidate that pays the most lip-service to him.

"Holy CRAP! I can't even believe this is a damned issue. The last time I checked this is a friggin DEMOCRACY! Free Market! Capitalism. Who gives a shit how many houses he owns! I have an accountant that handles my finances. So what! I have investment properties, and I couldn't tell you how many I own, and what company name they are under. I could find out with one phone call. 

Didn't Obama just finish a nice vacation on a PRIVATE BEACH in Hawaii? Doesn't he own a million dollar home, and a home in LA, and 2 or 3 vacation houses? Doesn't he also have a half brother that lives in a damn box? Who cares? Shit! 

The bottom line is that that old piece of crap isn't fit to run this country, and Obama better not throw stones about houses, since one of his he had help getting from some EXTREMELY DIRTY PEOPLE!!! 

I'm so worried that he is going to lose this election by playing these little games! He needs to go for the throat of Mccain, and stop pussy footing around!!! I'm so sick and tired of him playing these damned games, and changing his positions on very serious matters! 

If Obama loses this it's his own fault, and then we will be stuck with 4 more years of Bush Jr. ",-5
"I'm also from Indiana, and really went back and forth about voting for Obama or Ron Paul just because I hate Hillary's scheming all the time.  In the end I had to vote my conscience and beliefs.  Ron Paul.",3
BARACK OBAMA IS UBIK,1
Not cool at all.  Obama would be outraged by this - I know I am.  There is no class in kicking the losers.,1
"If Bush were to attack Iran, if Bin Laden were to release a tape, if McCain had any unheard of news to release today would be the most opportune time to release it.  It gives little time for Obama to defend himself, and if released too late it might not have any great influence.

I'm just hoping that if nothing occurs today, we're in the clear barring a stolen election of course.

Any thoughts?  I think today holds the most likely time frame an October Surprise might occur if there were one.  Of course anything could still happen, even on the last day. Just my humble opinion. I also don't believe the McCain campaig has any real ammunition to go after Obama with.  It will be interesting to see what they concentrate on in the next few days.

My guess is the best McCain will be able to come up with is Rashid Khalidi to whom he donated nearly half a million dollars through charity.",1
"Well, at the end of the video, the FoxNews (ahem) presenters state clearly that all 23 people in the room working the dials were ""undecided"" and, of those, 4 people admitted to having ""switched their position"" after watching the third debate and were now going to vote for Obama.",3
"That's not looking at individuals, that's just grouping people together and saying the ""average"" is a tax decrease.  [This chart from the Tax Policy Center](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=1969&amp;DocTypeID=1) shows more of the individual impact of Obama's plan.  It shows that a non-trivial percentage of people (6-8%) who make very little money will see a tax increase under Obama's plan.  Just because 60% of people see a tax cut does not mean nobody sees a tax hike as Biden specifically said.",6
"The audio engineer cranked up the music volume to cover the audience noise because they were booing. This is opposite what they'd expected to do -- turn down the music to let the audience cheering come through -- because there wasn't much cheering going on. It was mostly a resounding booing sound from all corners of the arena.

I especially enjoyed the Obama sign in the background.",4
"True dat. Not all pro-lifers agree on that point. I should have said ""pro-lifers believe the fetus is a human, therefore it's murder, no matter the stimulus for the pregnancy"" and left out the point of conception bit.

I've worked my way up and down the point-of-humanity timeline, and finally settled on conception. Oddly enough, I was led there by the majority Supreme Court opinion in Roe v. Wade:

&gt; We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.

This forced me to think: if we don't know when life begins, because we can't even really define what ""life"" is, isn't it most moral (in a universal and non-religious sense) to ""play it safe""?

There is a commonly-held belief that, at the very worst, the fetus becomes ""human"" (in the sense that it has the rights of any birthed human) when it is self-sufficient outside the womb, but this line changes as medicine advances, and so it seems arbitrary to define humanity based on current medical knowledge.

I sort of ""switched teams"" to the Democrat side (or, at the very least, don't consider myself a party-line Republican any more) over the last several years, but one area I cannot understand is how an intelligent, thinking individual with clear moral and ethical fiber can say with confidence that a fetus is not a human. It's one of the holes in my support of Obama.

Edit: My last paragraph is not intended to be baiting or backhanded, I mean it sincerely: I cannot reason my way into the  sort of confidence in saying ""at this point, a fetus is not a human"" it would take for me to call it ""not murder"".",3
"Why? Reddit is just a community of people voting up or down depending on their opinions. If you have valid reasons why John McCain would make a superior president than Barack Obama, use them to persuade others to your way of thinking. If you fail to persuade others to your way of thinking then the possibility exists that your reasons weren't as valid as you thought they were or your ability to express your opinions are lacking. But keep in mind that most of the people on reddit are better educated than the average so they are less likely to buy into simplistic Fox News-like jingoistic propaganda and you'll have to employ more reason in your arguments. But the floor is open for you to convince us that we are wrong and you are right. I voted you up from zero to one in the hopes that you’ll rise to the occasion. Have at it, man!",0
"**I wish people wouldn't link at all to faux ""news""... if there is a legitimate story, it will be covered elsewhere.**

Why help the right-wing-lies-and-smears channel (and website) gain addition revenue from us?

Also, whenever they are involved, one might suspect that they are doing something like tampering with a poll... first to draw in Obama supporters by giving him a lead, then reversing the votes to confuse and demoralize people.

Let's not put ANYTHING past the network that got talking points directly from Bush's White House!  The solution?  Don't link to them!",1
"Okay, i'll bite.  You say *You look at the title, and miss the point of it. And by ""you"", I mean most people who stumbled upon this item. I wonder why...*  

So how about I tell you?  We (the community of reddit) have heard all the Ron Paul fans on reddit start pretending that Obama and McCain are the same and they are both like Bush.  in other words vote Ron Paul or you get Bush again and America will be doomed.  No proof of course, just asserting it over and over and over hoping the accusation will stick.

That's what the title sounds like.  So I and others saw this ""vote alternative"" title and thought ""it's Paultard vote alternative propoganda again"" and reacted accordingly.",1

"You're correct that delegate count is what matters here.  And MSNBC is predicting that best case delegate count for Clinton tonight is a loss by four.

The page that you linked to includes previously decided superdelegates, plus the delegate count for previous contests, and does not include all of tonight's delegates yet.

Tonight was essentially a tie, and that's frankly *lucky* for the Clintons - given Obama's growing momentum, I suspect that California would have been very different if not for the fact that well over a third of the votes there were cast by absentee ballot several weeks ago, when Clinton was in more favor than she is now.

The Clinton camp will attempt (has attempted, is attempting) to spin it as a great victory, despite the fact that Obama:

* Won more states
* Will probably win more delegates
* Has growing momentum
* Is raising more money
* Is entering a phase of the election (small numbers of states to concentrate on at any given time) that greatly favors his talents

Clinton's got to be seriously nervous at this point.",5

They asked why Dems in Penn weren't voting for him and he basically said that the economy for the last 20 years was so bad that they were bitter and not willing to take a chance on someone named Obama - a little racist swipe there too.

The lie is that the economic times were bad in the 90's.  500,000 jobs created is not a wasteland.  He was pandering to elitist limo libs who think that anyone not voting for Obama is some backwater racist hick when they're just blue collar and practical.",-5

"Indeed.  I've read it a few times now, and from what I can gather, someone made a remark that Clinton's campaign made these statements first, then a news agency got hold of a memo indicating Obama said it, and reported that story.  It could be that both campaigns said something similar.  Why they're even talking to Canadian officials at this point is beyond me.",2

"If you think only the Republicans can shred the country to pieces, you are naive. While Obama is extremely charming, a lot of people will be voting for him because they don't think they can handle McCain.

Obama's presidency does not necessarily mean the end of ""Big Brother"" initiatives. Picking Biden, who claims to have scripted the patriot act (after Okalahoma?), is just another way Obama is willing to compromise liberty in America.

Every election people just pick the lesser of the two ""evils"". And that will never work - not for the people anyway.",7
"""a little harder"" being the operative word here. I can agree that on paper, he appears to want to change things more than Hilliary. However, the establishment (MSM and Kennedy) are welcoming Obama with open arms. That has to mean something and it tells me that the establishment hates Clinton. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. 

&gt; Obama was right about the most important decision this country had to make in the last eight years and Clinton was wrong. 

What exactly was this he was right on? The Patriot Act or not going to war? He wants to go to war, he might not have wanted to goto war with Iraq, but he will get us into a war if given the chance.

The amazing thing about Obama is that people support him just for his ideas and speeches. That doesn't prove anything and it's just a crap shoot about what will happen.",-1

If I'm right, we are going to have to start ""re-distributing"" the wealth. But it won't work in the same way it has.  At some point we're going to have to determine how productive technology has made us. In other words, what is the new full employment? And what do we do with those who really aren't needed to make the wheel turn?  We need to understand where this is going before we simply dump more money in to the system, or take money from small businesses who may be game changers for labor.",0
