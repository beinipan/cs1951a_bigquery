"I agreed to go on a date with this guy. Real suave, thinks he's hot stuff. Golden boy of the campus kind of thing. Dating in the place I was at meant 'go out to dinner, and then hit the only club in town for a little dancing'. He worked part-time as a marketing adviser for the club, so he tells me in advance that he might need to schmooze for a few minutes while we're there, but after that he's 'all mine'.

Okay, no problem. We get there and he drags me around introducing me to the owner, the dj, the lights guy, every 'important' person he could think of to show off to me. Then he has to go do the schmoozing for a bit, so he sticks me in the dj's booth, making it out like it's some big honor/VIP thing.

Half an hour later he still hasn't come back, so I go out on the dance floor to have fun with a couple of my female friends. He immediately rushes over and escorts me back to the dj booth, saying he'll be just a couple more minutes and asking me to wait, because he doesn't want any other guys stealing me away. 

I play tetris on my phone for another half-hour and then go back to dancing with my friends. He rushes over again and begs me to go back to the booth. I tell him no. He leads me over to a VIP table where a bunch of his friends are sharing bottles of wine and orders me to sit with them if I want company. 

I sit with these strangers who show no interest in talking to me for about five minutes, then come to my senses and go dancing again. When he comes over this time, he's finally ready to dance, but I'm so completely over it that I just tell him I'm not interested any more.

 He acts like I've shot his dog. He tries to get close to me and put his arms around me, to butter me up or whatever. I tell him the date is over and I don't want him touching me. He slinks off to his buddies at the VIP table and spends the rest of the night looking mournfully in my direction like a moron.",1646

"Years ago when we bought our house, there was a second floor deck that was rickety and *(the railings were) starting to feel wobbly. There was no way in hell I could afford the thousands of dollars it would cost to demolish and replace it, so I started researching building codes. 

I found that the ledger was improperly fastened to the house, the balusters were improperly spaced, and there was no blocking installed between the joists. So I set out to fix it--myself.

Long story short, I repaired the structural issues and ended up replacing basically the entire deck except the floor boards and support posts, myself, for under $300. I can dig out before and after pics if there's interest.

TLDR: Little susy homemaker rebuilt a deck all by herself.


EDIT: Wow, okay. Here's a few pics! No, it's not perfect, but it'll hold up for a few more years, at least! And sorry there's no pics of the underside structural repairs. For all you pros, I also reinforced the main two supports by bolting 2x4s to front and back of each support, as well as adding all the missing joist hangers and brackets, and added blocking between each joist.

"Posted this ages ago on another forum. It was the first time I met someone off the internet and she nearly broke my faith in the whole system. Her name was Tanya and she was from the northern suburbs of Brisbane. She was into hip hop music and described herself as ""lithe"". Her picture looked a bit old but my loins thought it looked alright.

We arranged to meet at my local pub. I rock up and sit down and within about 20 seconds this tubby fat chick in an Eminem branded track suit comes over and sit down. I am just about to say ""excuse me, you fat slag, but this table is reserved"" when I realised that it is Tanya. I can tell from the similarities to the picture she sent me. If I squinted and added 50 pounds and about 10 years. She sits down and says ""fucken how are ya!"" with a mouthful of gum. I sit horrified across from her. I am simply stunned. I want to run but I am frozen to the spot. I decided to 'tough this one out'

We order some food. I order a light calamari salad. She orders the lamb shanks and some garlic bread and a cheese pizza. I am not shitting you. I decided at this point to start drinking heavily. So does Tanya, except I think she had about 4 hours on me. She was all over the place. Conversation was mainly about her and how much she loved shooting guns at clay targets. Also feral pigs and how you haven't lived unless you've knifed a pig and felt its blood run over your arms. It is at this point that I start looking for hidden cameras. I am completely sure that I am on some reality TV show. I start smiling faintly at the windows and nearby bushes in the vain hope that a well dressed lady with a microphone will come out and tell me ""Tanya"" is an actress. We'll have a laugh and I'll shake my head and go home feeling silly but relieved.

This doesn't happen. Our meals arrive. I daintily pick at the salad, being mindful not to make a pig of myself. Tanya has no such qualms. She's eating like a Viking. Just pure mastication and yammering about guns. She licks her fucking plate clean. Licks it! She then asks me ""are you gonna finish that?"" and points at my half finished salad. ""Knock yourself out, love"" It was like feeding time at the zoo. A zoo where the only animals were a weird hybrid walrus-warthog creature. I was in shock. 

We finish the meal and I pay. Now it gets awkward. I do the whole charade of ""gee will you look at the time?"". Tanya, swaying slightly, just asks me outright ""so,you wanna take me home and fuck me?""

I was disgusted. There is no way I will take this porker back to my home. I have standards. Standards that need to be kept.

"Nothing I can say can possibly describe the year I worked in Psychiatric Intensive Care. Creepy isn't the thing that comes to mind when I think back on it...more heartbreaking and horrifying. But creepiness was a part of it. Especially evening and night shifts, naturally.

There is always something disturbing about watching someone while they hallucinate. You can tell it is 100% real to them, and something about that makes you believe it, on some level. A lot of stories end with, ""and of course, I had to look over my shoulder to make sure"". You see the emotions it brings out. Here's a couple stories.

There was a woman that came in and sat down across the table from me for her admission interview. She had  bandages all over her arms and scotch tape over her mouth and ears. She looked very uncomfortable and wouldn't really sit still. When the nurse would ask her a question, she would peel the corner of the tape back and answer, then stick the tape back on really fast. We eventually found out that she saw and felt bugs crawling all over her, and they were trying to get inside her body. The tape was to keep the bugs out. The bandages were because some bugs got in and she had to dig them out. She couldn't sit still because she felt the bugs all over her even while we sat and talked. The worst part was, she had some idea that it was her mind playing tricks on her. Can you imagine going through your life, feeling like someone is continuously dumping buckets of cockroaches on your head, feeling like they're all over you and getting inside of you to the point that you're digging chunks out of your flesh in a panic, all while knowing intellectually that none of it is real?

Another story: A girl spent my entire 8 hour shift fist fighting the same ghost. She would throw a few punches, and obviously landed knockout blows, so she'd bend over and twist her hand around like she was wrapping some long hair around her wrist. She'd drag her opponent down the hallway, give a few good kicks, then set up for a curb stomp. Starts off kinda funny, then gets a little disturbing when you think about the graphic things going on in her mind, then just sad after you watch this replay for hours on end.",3400

When I was 8, I was rustling around in some big bushes up against the side of the house and found a boxy structure with a heavy door. To the left of the door, someone had scrawled ""The Lost World"" and drew the *Jurassic Park* logo.

As a *Jurassic Park* fan and budding young buccaneer, this intrigued me. Did this door lead to some kind of lost world? Was it hiding a fabulous secret? 

I spent three years trying to find out, but the door was always shut fast and locked with a big brass padlock. My schemes to invade, including digging under it from beneath the front porch, were failures. 

Finally, not long before we moved, I found the door unlocked and ajar. Flush with success, I crept inside...the well house. A cramped, stuffy little room containing only the well pump, spider webs, and a smaller door to the space under the house. 

It was anticlimactic, but it did give me three years of childish fancy.

Sure there are third world countries that have always had conflicts, but it seems all the ""first world"" generations have now heard nothing but war since they were born as well. 

Modern war is normal now. 

And yet, on a global scale, there is still less fighting than ancient and medieval times, when countless kingdoms and tribes were constantly having skirmishes with each other, from the Americas to Europe and the far East.

"The whole business surrounding the creation of Peter Pan is screwed up too.  In real life, the author had a brother who died very young.  His mother would often call the surviving son by the dead son's name and made him (or he went along with the ""game"") of pretending to BE that son.  When he wrote the play, Peter Pan became the boy who never dies.

The book he produced later is ... weird, to say the least.  Some have surmised that Peter is fascinated by death as he can't die.  It also appears that ""boyhood"" to Barrie meant ""not understanding your actions have consequences"" and that death was ""a great adventure"".  It does say Peter ""thins them out"" when the Lost Boys get too old.  Lost Boys also die during the battles and adventures Peter orchestrates.  When their numbers get too low he steals more children, again, all boys.  It's also said that he ""trims them down"" when they won't fit into his fort anymore.  

The psychological implications of a boy who can't die who considers death to be an ""adventure"" and kidnaps and eventually kills other children is chilling when you think about it.

Wendy is the only girl and he brought her along to literally ""be Mother"" to himself and the kids.  There's no romance, just Peter's need to have someone to look after him so he can have more free time to goof off.

It gets weirder.

The author of the book went on to befriend a family who have an infant named Peter.  When the father of the family dies, he altered the mother's will so that HE would be seen as the children's guardian.  Eventually the mother dies too and he takes over care of the kids.  He considered this Peter to be the inspiration for Peter Pan, and there are stories he would take the kid on promotional gigs for this reason.

This kid, Peter Llewelyn Davies, would commit suicide in his 60s.  While there were other factors that contributed to this, it should be noted he detested hearing about Peter Pan, the book or the play. Another of his siblings would die in an apparent suicide pact as well.

The whole thing is nuts.

"A few years ago, I began watching a lot of anal porn. I was a little hesitant about trying it, but it looked *hot*, especially when it came to women using sex toys on their pussies while a guy pounded away at her arse. I was curious and wanted to try it.  I was in a long distance relationship at the time, so we talked about it in preparation for the next visit; I had a shiny new butt plug and a plethora of lube ready to go.

Unlike porn, it wasn't quite as straightforward. I underestimated the results. We went at it for a bit and it felt good; he finished and I went to clean myself up.

I was unprepared for the marching band of cum farts that emitted from my newly discovered sweet spot. This was before we were fully comfortable letting rip in front of each other, so imagine the horror on my face when I realise that he can hear this roaring beast from the next room. The farts alone I might have been okay with, but the splattering detonation of semen made it sound like there was some explosive diarrhoea going on.  We ended up laughing about it, but at the time, it was terrible.

Still wouldn't stop me from trying anal again though.

"Animal behavior.

What is something most people would do if they saw a... I don't know, a lion running at them? Unlikely, but it could happen. Most people would try to hightail it out of there.

Do. Not. Run. If you run, you are prey. Stand your ground, make yourself as loud, large, and as threatening as possible. 

Never turn your back to a predator. They can and will take any opportunity you give them. Retreat *slowly*, but not quietly. You're trying to make them think you are the better predator than they are, but are letting them go on your own good grace. Once it has given up, THEN sidestep your way to safety. *Once it turns away and you truly believe that it has given up, stop shouting and making yourself a threat*.

Always be prepared in this situation. While you are making yourself seem like a large and powerful predator to an even larger and more powerful predator, they could try to charge you again. Mock charge or not, keep being loud and keep those arms flailing.

If none of the above works, and you're certain an attack is imminent, stay standing. I know that in a situation like that, crouching seems like a good idea. It is not. The cat will pin you and proceed to rip out your insides and munch on you while you're howling in pain.

While you're standing, it will try to go for your face and throat. Aim for its face, especially its eyes. Kick it in the ribs as hard as you possibly can. And if it gets ahold of your arm,*do not yank it out.* Their teeth are made for ripping, and are curved backwards slightly. This seems counterproductive, but AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN, try to punch the cat inside. Aim for the fucker's larynx. Then with a smooth and quick motion, try to get your arm out. Keep aiming for weak points, like eyes and face and joints.

If it finally gives up, congratulations! You just survived a lion attack! Go get patched up, go to a hospital and get your injuries taken care of. If not, well...

Spent the next week writing the best paper I could before the actual exam.  I used a small razor blade and cut one of the blank pages out of the book we were reading that semester (and able to take into the exam) and copied the exact font, spacing, page margins etc. and printed the paper I had written onto it. Stuck it in the middle of the book. Walked into the exam - the teacher checked my book for notes and found nothing.  Copied it out word for word during the exam and then pulled the page out and ate it.  Got a C

Edit: I scribbled this on a post in r/new before going to work and came home to this.
A little explanation - I ate the page because I was paranoid they'd check my pockets or something when I left the exam room (they didn't).  We had to leave the book in the exam room when we left so I didn't leave it in there.  I didn't have the answers to the exam, just the essay question.  I was never good at English so that's the best I could manage even with the time to prepare.

For bonus points:
One of my friends also cheat on an oral presentation - he recorded himself doing his whole presentation on his iPod.  In his presentation he was a muslim - so he 'got in character' by using traditional muslim dress.  He put the iPod on his head under a turban and played his presentation into his own ears and just repeated himself.  Worked OK and he didn't get caught either.",4408

The officiant had stopped by and said that if they don't sober up he ~~would~~ wouldn't perform the wedding. 

I head up to the room and they are all shitfaced. I start having them do anything I had ever heard about sobering them (I know it doesn't actually work but a. You got to try something and b. The officiant said that if the groom can get all the way to the front without falling over, he would consider him sober enough...  They where that drunk) some how they sobered up enough, gotten dressed, to the wedding. Poor bastards stood up the swaying... But somehow made it. The bride was not happy... 

Then came the reception...  About 10 minutes in one of the idiot groomsmen decided he need a drink to calm his stomach... While looking toward the bride and groom, he started to projectile vomit...  He got the bride, groom, and best man...

You're not always supposed to love it. If you do what you love, we wouldn't be doing shit. We wouldn't go to 8AM classes, go to the gym when we're tired, talk to girls in fear of rejection or read a book when we could be partying.

You will feel like a champ, but as Mohammed Ali said, *Champions aren't made in gyms [...] They have to have the skill, and the will. But the will must be stronger than the skill.* The day that you get an 80% (or whatever mark you desire) on your exam, the day you get complemented on your physique, the day you can go on the second date with a girl that's waaaay out of your league... is the same day everyone sees how much of a champ you are.

The other person in any of these transactions judges you extensively. If you show up wearing a bathrobe and a greasy white T-shirt smelling like unwashed balls, talk obnoxiously, tell stupid jokes that only you laugh at, or have any other irritating habits, people are not going to like you. Your reputation and your word are probably the two most valuable things you have.

THATS AGAINST THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS WE ALL TOTALLY READ,2001
"On the first item, men are taught from a very young age that certain emotions are associated with weakness and are not allowed.  Sadness, uncertainty, doubt--none of these are manly emotions, so we're told we don't ""get to"" experience them.  Pack that shit down, man.  Way, way down.  Cover it up, don't talk about it, wait for it to go away.  Or, to sum it all up: ""man up.""  So that stoic and detached look is the look of a man who can't do the thing he really wants to do (cry, put his head in his hands, ask for help), and so has to wear a mask for awhile.
     
On the second point, here's a funny thing: this is a problem where men and women are equally at fault, and yet people always conceptualize it as though it was a male problem.  The core issue is that men and women want different things when they discuss the problems in their lives.  Men want advice, women want someone to listen to them and then validate how they feel (i.e., ""man, that's tough, sorry about that!"").  So when you emote like that to a man, you're both making a mistake.  Your mistake is asking him to provide a response that's against his nature.  His mistake is responding normally rather than just patting your back and shaking his head.  You're both equally failing in this communications breakdown, and yet *every single time* people talk about this, it's framed as a ""what the hell is wrong with men"" issue.  It's not.  If you go to the ocean and fill your glass, you don't get to complain that the water is salty--what did you expect?  If you go to a man and lay out a problem you're having at work, you shouldn't be surprised if he tries to offer you a solution.  That's how we're wired.

You need to keep earbuds in but not actually play any music. Sometimes I actually hide my phone inside a pouch or a jacket pocket, then just put my earbud cord into my back pocket like my phone is in there. 

It helps for two reasons- people don't get as angry when you ignore them yelling things at you (been followed for ignoring someone asking for money when I did not have earbuds in). Also, if someone does decide to try and get the jump on you, they think you can't hear them or won't notice them approaching.

So she ties me up tight, with a blindfold and mouth gagged. Sweet. I'm all in. She starts and is really intense. Much more agressive than usual. Cool. Then she starts biting, scratching, and tickling. Cool. Right as I am about to cum she hops off and starts jerking me off slowly. Perfect. 

For the first couple seconds of my orgasm are amazing, but she keeps going. Still amazing, but getting a little too intense, and I start trying to squirm away. She starts tugging much more aggressively, and I start thrashing but with no success because I'm tied. To slow my thrashing she straddled my thighs and put all her weight on my upper legs. 

At this point I am completely restrained, and I am screaming through the gag. Pretty obvious that things are way too intense to for me and I am ready to stop. The feeling at this point is impossible to describe. It felt great, but was WAY too intense. She just kept going and going despite my screaming. I ended up having 3 more orgasms before she stopped. I was covered in jizz and lotion. 

When she was done she pulled the gag and the blind fold off, and started to untie me. I was pissed. I asked her WTF?!, and she quipped back ""You gave me permission to do whatever I wanted so I did whatever I wanted."" I just laid there for a few minutes.

"I went to high school (250 students total) with this kid who was a bit of a loner and had a reputation for being a pathological liar. In college, my friends and I began to notice these beautiful girls writing to him on his facebook wall. At first, it struck us as odd, but we left it alone. As weeks passed, our news feeds continued to be flooded with new girls we had never heard of flirting with him, so we started to get curious (some of us have known this kid our entire lives, and we could count the number of times he spoke to girls on one hand). We later discovered that he had created 30-40 fake facebook profiles with completely fabricated backstories and stole pictures of real women he found on the internet. He would carry out conversations with himself by posting from all the fake female accounts multiple times a day on his wall about fake parties, hang outs, etc. and respond from his own account. 

After this happened, he closed his facebook account. We later found out he had become a gambling addict and spent time in a mental institution. Eventually, he moved to another city, and got a job.  He refriended all of his HS classmates (including me), and from what I see, he seems pretty happy. It took him a while, but I'm glad things worked out for him in the end.

**Edit:** After skimming through the comments, it seems many people suspect that his happy ending is also fabricated, so I'll fill you in on what I know. I have no idea if the life he portrays on his current profile is fake, but if I had to guess, I would say its real. It is too ordinary to be fake (unless he some sort of fb profile faking mastermind). Here is a more detailed version of his histroy: After this whole facade with the fake fb profiles, he emerged on facebook a couple of years later. It turned out that had he moved to a new city and got a new job. He only posted about his new obsessions: working 100+ hour weeks, working out on a daily basis, and cooking healthy meals. All the fake facebook friends were gone; in fact, no one posted on his wall at all. Then he deleted his profile **again**, and returned a year later. This time his posts were only about his new puppy and girlfriend. Though I believe he had a girlfriend because she was in the pictures with him, I suspect he made up a story about losing his puppy. The long workdays, workouts, and cooking were never mentioned again. He then deleted his profile **again**, and returned to what is now his current profile. He posts about his new obsessions: economics, the oil industry, and his dog. His girlfriend is not there anymore. He doesn't seem to be have many friends or a life outside of his job. When I said earlier that he ""seems happy"", I meant that as a relative term. He is no longer lying or seeking validation from the people around him. He isn't using facebook as a tool for attention anymore, now he just posts his thoughts about the previously mentioned subjects. He seems much more content being in his own skin. I can't help but simultaneously feel sorry and happy for him. It's so conflicting!",3167

So my father's response? ""Let's wait until your mother's gone for work."" 

Fast forward 20 minutes, mom's gone off to work. And we've set up the holy mother of all RC ramps up the back of the truck and were launching these RC cars over the house. Both found it really hilarious, until I messed up and didn't hit the jump fast enough. Ended up sending it through the window. 

Dad's response as he looks at his watch. ""Guess what kid? Your going to learn how to replace a window today before your mom gets home..."" 

Six hours later, received one of the many life lessons from my Dad. He was such a cool cat, we have many stores like this. So many. 

I'll miss him. He was the best. He died just this last year. But goddamn the old coot, spent a long time before he died setting up a secret 'pirate map' with an old chest buried out on our few acre property. It had our favorite bottle of drink that we sat down and drank together when we were getting older, along with a diary of ""Hey kid. Remember this? You'll be a strong woman when you grow up, I taught you a lot of things that will help you later on in life. Don't lose sight of what's important."" Ahh.. When I found the box, I must of cried like a baby for about 10 hours outside reading that. And the final page said, ""It's okay to cry. I'll miss you.""

((Sorry for the feels, Miss my dad.))

Soon me and my friend go to bed and I wake up violently around 3am because I heard something. I go to wake my friend up (we were sharing his bed) and he is gone. I freak the fuck out and hide under the sheets until morning and then work up the courage to tell his parents that Bloody Mary took him.

It felt like the end of the earth. A place that the world, and even time itself forgot. It was so hot and humid it felt like I couldn't breathe. The people looked absolutely exhausted and miserable; the poverty really stood out to me, compared even to other places in the country.. There was nothing beautiful to see, just big empty roads, dirt and dust, and people who looked like they had nothing meaningful in their lives. 

Yemenis are renowned for their friendliness and hospitality, but I saw none of that in Al Hodeidah. It was like decades of misery just ground them down into nothingness.

"My mother was somewhat of a hoarder. She taught elementary school, and saved everything because ""you never know what could be turned into a project."" Our garage would get so full of crap that you couldn't hardly walk through it. So annually, my mother would go on this work related retreat; and as her car was turning the corner and out of sight, a dumpster would be getting dropped off in our driveway.

For an entire day, my dad - giddy and covered in sweat - would be hauling out who knows what, and tossing it. 

My mother, of course, would immediately know things were missing and go absolutely ape. We'd spend the next few months afterwards with her asking, ""Did you throw (insert random item here that probably would have never been used again, except now as a source of ire against my dad) away too!!?"" And my dad would look at us with, ""Keep your friggin mouths shut"" eyes and reply, ""Oh no Dear, we wouldn't have tossed that out. It's probably still in the garage somewhere.""

Occasionally, my mom would go look to see for herself; but I think even she understood that it was an exercise in futility because if it was still there - good luck finding it, and if it wasn't - how would you know for sure?

"Growing up in a small town, the guy that umpires all the little league games was a great umpire, but he had some issues upstairs, like he was somewhere on the autism scale. But like folks with some form of autism, he could pick one thing and focus on it and be good. His thing was baseball.


Anyhow, the end of the little league season, the coaches wanted to have a tournament with all the teams in town (I think there was like 6 teams) that hadn't been planned on do the city didn't budget for it. So everyone pitched in to get the fields ready, and the umpire was more than happy to volunteer to ump the games. 

Anyhow, being that this was now some arbitrary tournament, some parents started giving the umpire a hard time and by the time it got the the championship game, one guy in particular was ruthless. So finally the umpire had enough, threw off his mask and lost his mind on the dude going ""Fuck you, I have had enough of your shit, you want to have an fucking umpire this game, do it your fucking self"" and on and on for a couple minutes. And then he got on his bike and ride away. 


Another parent who played college baseball stepped in to umpire, and the dickhead parent was told to get the fuck out. 


The sad thing is the original umpire never worked for the recreation department again. Like the one think this dude could do normally, was taken away from him.

There wasn't even a trophy or prize involved in this tournament, it was just an opportunity for 11 year olds to play a few more games.

She capitalised on this and treated me like absolute crap - always doing me down and not actually doing anything to help train me or show me better ways of doing things. So one day I just snapped. I said ""fuck you"" under my breath. She heard me and said ""I beg your pardon?"". 

I thought for a fraction of a second about apologising but decided not just to repeat it, but to shout it. Then I told her what a bullying bitch she was before telling her where she can stick her job.

Getting out of that cesspit ended up actually being the best career move I could have made.

"I've told this story before, but something like this actually happened in my life once. 

My wife (then fiance) had gone out for the night to here Bachelorette's Party, leaving me to tend house. She was out until 3 in the morning and I was ready at home with buckets for the inevitable vomit scattered where I thought they would be necessary. Suddenly she bursts into the house, hanging off of one of her bridesmaids, and collapses into a chair. She starts taking off her jewellery and almost immediately blacks out. Her eyes rolls back and she drops to the floor. A split second later she's up again, glasses askew, freaking out because she can't find her jewellery, somebody must have stolen it because she was just wearing it, and if she doesn't find it ""my husband will kill me!"" 

I'm immediately concerned, she still thinks she's at the bar, and her escort home laughs and runs out the door. ""Have fun!"" She calls back to me. ""She was doing that the whole way home!"" I try and explain to her that she's home, and she'll get it for about five seconds, but every time she closes her eyes she's back at the bar. At one point she recognized me long enough to ask why I came to the party. I took off her glasses before she smashed them and carried her to bed, knowing full well it was going to be a long night. 

I had two 4 Liter ice cream pails in the bedroom, and I'm pretty sure that nearly 6 liters of pure alcohol came out of her. Her vomit was jet black, made my eyes water, and contained peanuts and little bits of fruit. That was bad enough (but thank God it came out). As soon as she could talk again she reached out, a look of pure awe in her blurry eyes, and touched my face. 

""My God."" She said. ""You're beautiful."" I had a moment of pride, and then: ""Are you the stripper?"" 

""I'm your fiance."" I said. 

""He's at home."" She said, and then looked uncomfortable. ""You should go dance for my sister. She hired you."" Again I explained who I was. 

She got angry. 

""You know what? I brought money for you but I'm just gonna spend it on drinks. You don't get any. Now go away or my husband is gonna kick your ass.""

This went on at length. She was all over the place with her story (sometimes she was a married woman, sometimes I was waiting for her in the car, etc) but she was insistent I should leave her alone. Eventually 3AM became 5AM and I wanted to go to bed. The vomiting had dried up and I turned off the light and approached the bed. 

Have you ever had the shit kicked out of you by a person who can't even stand? I have. Every impact was punctuated by statements like, ""My husband is gonna kick your ass!"" Which was of course pronounced like ""Ma husbanz gonna kick yer azz.""

Neither party allowed the other into the building.  It was about to get ugly. The mechanics wanted in to get their own tools out of the seized building, and the bank guy was insisting that they were taking everything as chattel. (not a smart thing to threaten).  So my dad played an interesting card to help out the mechanics.  He went and bought coffee and doughnuts, and ""hired"" them all on a one hour employment contract.  He ""reposessed"" their tools as they all ""owed him money"". Then he turned to the bank guy and said ""I now have over $100 grand worth of property in that building that you're holding illegally, because I own it.  I suggest you let my employees into the building to get my property, or this officer here may arrest you for interfering with a legal asset seizure. Because you seized the building, not the stuff in it. Or are you claiming that the four customer cars I can see in there belong to you now?""

In the end, I think the cop ""took the bank guy for a coffee"", just so the mechanics could ""calm down and not go in the building whatsoever, right.""",1587

"I was a bridesmaid in a childhood friend's wedding a few years back. Other than me and one other woman (the maid of honor), the other 4 bridesmaids were newer friends/coworkers of the bride. One of them was the worst human being I ever met in my life. I'll refer to her as Jane (not her real name, obvs.) Anyway, Jane persuaded the bride that the bachelorette party needed to be a weekend away to a city that is well-known for bars and partying. It was a 10 hour car ride from the bride's city, so we roadtripped. I'll summarize the trip in bullet points:

* After collecting everyone, we pick up Jane last. We were even 45 minutes later than we said we'd be, and when we enter her house, she is standing there in her underwear eating a cold taco, and we realize she is hung over and hasn't even packed yet. This delays us another hour.
* On the trip there, she (a gradeschool teacher) said that last year's students were so annoying that they gave her PTSD. lol k. I had suffered from PTSD after I nearly was killed once, so I was curious and asked her about it. She then nervously changes the subject when she realizes she's been called out.
* She says some really horrible racist stuff, and then looks around the car to see what people's reactions were. 
* We get to our hotel around dinnertime. We decide to eat and then get ready to go out at night. The rest of us throw on casual clothes, then we have to wait for her. She gets so overly done up, and wears heels and cakes on 3"" of makeup. She looks like a damn fool next to the rest of us.
* We uber to our first bar. We're there like maybe an hour. The place is filled with extremely beautiful young women, and Jane is clearly eyeballing all of them and is noticeably self-conscious. A little while later, we leave and walk to the next bar. Me and one other realize we've separated from the rest of the group, so we backtrack and find them trying to hail a cab to go home. ""What's going on?"" I ask. Jane said she was sick so everyone else decided to call it a night. It's like 10pm on a Friday.
* We get back to the hotel room. SURPRISE! Jane is all better! She does an obscene amount of shots and gets super shitty drunk. Then she puts on her new bikini and parades around the room, saying things like ""Does this make my butt look big? I think this color looks bad on me. I am so ugly lolol"" and everyone else is like ""No! You're beautiful! You look good!"" I seemed to have been the only one who could see she was clearly fishing for compliments.
* Saturday was full of big plans for the bride. We go to the bride's favorite bar (a country bar) and are there maybe 30 minutes. It's the most fun 30 minutes of the whole trip, all of us are dancing and having a great time. Jane is seated at a table and just pouts the whole time and bitches about how she hates country music. So we leave and go somewhere else, but she somehow manages to convince the bride that it was her own idea to leave.
* The rest of the night is awful. She manipulates the bride into doing certain things that clearly were just activities she wanted to do. Then if anyone else protests, she is like ""HOW DARE YOU. THIS IS THE BRIDE'S SPECIAL DAY."" 
* The night culminated with a huge fight in the middle of the dance floor in a super trashy club. Most of us weren't even tipsy because we didn't feel comfortable enough to drink for most of the night. During this fight, the Maid of Honor says something about how the bride doesn't look like she's having fun at all, and suggested we go back to the other bar. Jane shoots everyone's ideas down. So we awkwardly try to have fun and recover from the fight. It's genuinely awful. We get back to our suite, and Jane, the bride, and two others lock themselves in their bedroom, leaving just the MOH and myself in our room. We can hear them gossiping in there all night.
* After the trip, MOH gets a phone call and is downgraded to regular bridesmaid. Bride says, ""Things that were said over the weekend were really hurtful to me."" MOH is extremely confused, as they seemed to have gotten along really well the whole time and honestly has no clue what she said. MOH and I figure out it was some lie that Jane had told the bride. She decides she is not going to participate in the wedding at all, since it was going to cost her upwards of $1000 for travel, accommodation, etc. I stick to my commitment since I am still neutral in all of this.
* Wedding happens a few months later. Surprise! Guess who the new MOH is? At rehearsal, she shows up and is soooooo overly made up again. She is even wearing a white dress. Bride looks visibly upset but is too shy to stand up for herself.
* Next day, we all get ready for the wedding. Jane finds out that her dress is too tight (she had it shortened and taken in so she could look extra trampy. Looked like a damn sausage in the thing) and she can't bend down to adjust the bride's train. It takes every ounce of energy for me to not bust out laughing. Someone else had to then be emergency MOH.
* Jane gets super sloshed at the reception, makes an ass of herself hitting on every groomsman, who all happen to be married and attending with their spouses. She then yells in the middle of the dance floor during a quiet song, ""THEY ARE ALL A BUNCH OF GAY F**S"".

There were so many other little things I could have written, but I had to end this post somewhere. She clearly had some major demons she was battling (and losing to), and it seemed like every action she took was just done in an attempt to gain attention from people. After this, I saw the movie *Bridesmaids* and it was even more funny to me because so much of it was so relatable. In this case though, the character of Helen was played by a shallow, manipulative, xanax-fuelled bimbo.

I mean what in the actual fuck? I'll admit to not having delved into extreme details to see if this is a one sided story or not but for once in my life I just don't see the need to.

Now it's finally getting attention and the shit I see coming out of this is ridiculous. I know there are areas of the world that are in bad shape with corrupt leaders, and I feel for them, I do, but for it to be happening in this country is an outrage to me. 

~~You're telling me that they're being threatened to have their kids taken away because they won't pay the water bill? Social services is willing to come in there and take their kids for not having ""running water"" when the water would be poison?~~ It seems this part is not true, thanks /u/serccsvid. That said, supposedly they still face fines if they won't pay it, which is ridiculous too. And even if that weren't true, my outrage level would be taken from like a 10 to a 9.9; poison water has still been delivered to these homes for far too long.

They can't sell their damned houses because it's illegal to sell with contamination? So they can't even sell their house to move out?

All these facets of the government are working **but not the one that deals with the fucking water going to their house being poison? FOR A YEAR?!**

\~~strikethrough~~

&gt; super^script

super\^script

You can also scale the superscript into seemingly infinity, by adding additional \^:

&gt; super^script^is^cool

super\^script\^is\^cool

***
(credits to /u/KlonopinUpGirl)  
Additionally, you can use parantheses to group text, like this: (a b c).  
Normally when you use superscript and use a space in the text, it ends up ^like this. (\^like this)  
But by grouping the text with parantheses, you can use superscript on the whole text. Alternatively, you can also put single letters into parantheses to use superscript only on those letters, not the whole word.  
Example: ^(Yorokobe Shounen) or th^(i)s  
Example: \^(Yorokobe Shounen) or th\^(i)s 

***
&gt; If you put a # before your words at the start of the line, it looks
&gt; #like this

This one was explained well, but I can do it better:
\#like this

&gt; You sometimes have to put an extra return between lines, use the live preview box below to confirm.

Two spaces = new line[space][space]  
Two enter = new paragraph[enter][enter]

example

&gt; Sometimes characters don't show up, this guy:

is not escaped properly.

&gt;춾\_()_/춾 

-
&gt; should look like this:  
춾\\\_()_/춾

춾\\\\\\_()_/춾  
Now this is simply too much. If you want to write special characters (\*, \\, \^ etc) normally, you need to escape them with a backslash (\\) in front of them. If you want to write \\, you have to write \\\\. But the third backslash in the smiley is useless.

&gt; you may have to use more than one (like with 춾\_()_/춾 ), but not often.

I don't think I remember anytime when you would have to escape a character twice, except maybe if you were dealing with two different formatting systems at the same time.

-
Additionally:

If a new paragraph isn't enough padding for you, you can add \- on a new line and it'll add another bit of space. Like this:

&gt; a[enter][enter]
&gt;
&gt;\-  
&gt;b[enter][enter]
&gt;
&gt;c

becomes this:

&gt;a
&gt;
&gt;-
&gt;b
&gt;
&gt;c

You can also place a space between quotes like this.  

Without:

&gt; a

&gt; b

With:

&gt; a

-
&gt; b

Also, as you saw in the first example of -, you should generally use [enter][enter] before formatting like quotes, code or such, as they won't work otherwise. Basically, every formatting change which affects whole lines needs to follow two enter.

-
Also, *** will create a horizontal line:

***

Most of these work inside quotes as well.",1050

"Had a summer job at an industrial clothes rental and washing place. Shit comes in from slaughterhouses and similar places, then sits in the summer heat for days before it arrives. There were sometimes open knives in those moldy overall pockets. We had to check those pockets w/o gloves and were yelled at if we cut ourselves and went to get medical attention or just to disinfect the wounds.

After two weeks I started recording what was going on and reported it after another week. 

Couple of months later, I testified in court, then heard nothing for years.

At first, it seemed to have no effect, but after talking to the guy who got me the gig, I found out that the owner is in prison for a ton of stuff, breaking labor laws being one of the minor charges.

Not exactly a blaze of glory but rather a small spark that started a slow burn.

Edit: fixed autocorrect

Edit 2: Comprehensive writeup of the story now that I'm not on the phone:

The story takes place in Germany, Summer 2010.

I got a summer job at what is essential an industrial clothes rental and laundry shop (think overalls), total duration of three weeks.

When the clothes arrived at my job, I (along with two others) had to follow this procedure:

* dump them into metal bins 
*sort them by manufacturer, severity and kind of the dirt/stains, manufacturer and colour
* check the pockets for loose items like change, wrenches etc. (we didn't get gloves for this)
* scan a barcode that was sewn into the overalls

You had a certain number of codes you had to scan per hour, which would be ok for people who have been properly instructed on the procedure and had some experience (i.e. recognize all of the above shit at a glance).

We all were students aged 16 - 18 who had never really ""worked"" before, so we were slow at first. This meant that we were yelled at, told to skip our breaks (i.e. clock out for your break, go back to work, clock back in after 30 min.). By the boss himself.

On top of this, one of the main clients is a slaughterhouse that lets the clothes sit in bags for a week before sending them in. In the middle of a summer with 38춿c peak temperatures.

They also worked with some knives akin to box cutters which they frequently forgot in their pockets, sometimes wih an open blade, too.

So when those overalls came in, everyone got some cuts on their hands. When we went to report the wounds, get them disinfected and patched up, each of us were told to shut the fuck up and go back to work.

After two weeks, I was fed up and started bringing my digital camera to work, hid it in my clothes and recorded the conditions when we were unsupervised as well as the audio of multiple run-ins with the boss.

After the last week was up, I went to the police with all the evidence and filed charges.

Early in 2011, I was called to court to give my statement but didn't keep up with the legal proceedings.

Two months ago, I visited my hometown and ran into one of the guys who worked there with me. He told me that the boss/owner was in jail.

During the Investigation, the police found out that on top of endangering workers and breaking labor laws, he was involved with drugs and avoided taxes among other things.

One day, he was handing back papers (one that I hadn't turned in), and he admitted that he had ""misplaced"" a few essays, but he assured us that he had read them and graded them before they were lost, and told us to check the comments in Powerschool ( online K-12 grading database). Mine was commented as ""Another solid essay. Could have used some more polish, but well-done overall."" Ended up getting a B+ for a paper that *I never turned in.* Others that turned in their papers received similarly vague comments.

Myself and three or four other people soon realized that, if you didn't turn in an essay, he would just assume that he lost it in the hoarder's paradise that was his office, since he would print every single paper out, and read and grade it by hand. 

As it was an english class, we had one or two papers due every week. By the end of the semester, I hadn't turned in any for weeks.

"I was a very 'poor' kid with a scholarship to one of the richest if not THE richest high schools in the city. I have quite a few gems.

the first is this one boy who's dad owns about 15 Ferraris was talking to me about life after school (he was 17/18 at the time) and I said I wanted a studio apartment. he thought it was a whole floor to yourself. when I explained it was just one room, he was confused for a long while, thought I was making things up, and when he eventually accepted it said ""why would you want to live in something like that? it's pretty much a jail cell isn't it? I can't believe poor people live like that... do poor people really live like that?""

I went on to explain to him that actually poor people are a lot worse off, you still need quite a bit of money and a solid savings and income for a studio apt. for some reason he thought the smart thing to spew out of his mouth was ""you know, I heard when poor people feel sad about being poor, they watch documentaries on Africa and stuff like that. maybe you should try that sometime."" he was genuinely 100% serious and thought it was good advice. all I could say was ""thanks Jxxx, I'll try that next time!""

there was also the time I was stuck in a global politics class where no one knew what welfare/the dole was, the teacher explained, and everyone was OUTRAGED because why should lazy poor people get THEIR money that they worked hard for? how dare they not work for it like rich people had to. my family was on welfare at the time, both my parents were made redundant around the same time just because budget cuts, I was 15 and the only one in a house of 6 people with a job. welfare helped us eat. it took all my strength not to break down in tears during that class, indirectly hearing that I'm scum and don't deserve to eat pretty much.

they'll do anything to show off how they donated $20 to a charity in Africa, and rave on and on about third world countries, but when it comes to fixing our own they don't say a word or they criticise the less fortunate because their money is more important than the people.

I think the public perception there comes from two parts:

2. In cases of (especially long and drawn out) legal battles, the lawyers can end up getting quite a large amount of a settlement.  People tend to focus on the restitution rather than the penalization part of settlements, so they read ""lawyers get $30M; victims get $8 each in settlement"" as ""lawyers get $30M payout that should have gone to victims"" rather than ""it took 20,000 man-hours to win this case.""",2432

"Astronomer here!  Actually, we have even less time than 3.2 billion years for the grand majority of life on Earth.  In about 800 million years or so, photosynthesis will be impossible due to the effects of the increased luminosity of the sun, so everything that relies on that (~99% of all life on Earth, including all multicellular life) will die out then.

Edit: ok, lots of questions on how this happens and if life could evolve and adapt.  Basically, a higher luminosity translates into higher temperatures on Earth, which means more weathering of rocks and this traps carbon dioxide into the crust, into carbonate.  Further, increased temperatures causes water to evaporate so rocks harden and much of plate tectonics to stop, meaning volcanoes don't replenish this CO2 into the atmosphere, and ultimately it means oxygen will disappear as well.  So in one way or another, most life will suffocate to death.

The reason this is hard to adapt around (and the reason most life relies on either CO2 or O2) is this provides much more energy to the living creature than other processes.  So of course anything *could* happen, but if you look at evolution so far on Earth I don't think many biologists would place big bets in Vegas on this or anything.",1042

He set the bike back up, put me back in front of him, said, ""Don't tell your mother"", and off we went again.

I never did tell her.",3793
