"For those who might not know, Goku was voiced by the same actress in every one of his incarnations in Japanese - from his first appearance as a child in Dragonball to his adult form in Z. Wukong and Goku are both based off Sun Wukong from Journey to the West, an old Chinese novel, so Riot decided to use Goku's iconic voice actress for Wukong as a joke/reference. 

It's definitely a big departure from the English character, but so was the English dub voice for Goku in DBZ. Japanese fans will ""get it"" and appreciate it.

Instead we get these teasers of amazing quality only to be just that - teased. All the Shurima stories, the Shadow Isles, the Freljord, everything is a one off. 

So, we will probably never know why Garen, Vi, Zed and Sona were chosen by Jihn. In fact, there will be almost no tie in whatsoever to him at all. 

It is beyond frustrating. It's like they do everything they need to in order to have the lore foundation they need, then reset it for no reason.

Like all that shit with Bard saving the world from apocalypse - what was that for? Why did Sivir and Cassiopeia travel to Shurima? Why is there a little troll boy in Braums story if it's not Trundle?

"Turkish guy here! I don't have the link but here is a quick explanation on what TR server is:

* All supports build full damage or full tank, no ultility.
* The most popular support is Volibear, followed by Malphite then Blitz (then LeBlanc...).
* WTF are wards?
* No ultility mages.
* AD/AA champs are immensely popular (Yasuo, Zed, Yi, Fiora)
* I have played hundreds of games before transferring to EUW and **never** saw a game where someone didn't get reported (counting normals, arams and rankeds)
* Almost every solo laner takes ignite.
* Jungle items are rarely finished, everybody sells their machetes to build damage.
* I once told a (gold elo) Lee Sin to build sightstone and he reported me for flaming. (and did not buy sightstone)
* Idiotic usernames like XxXDarKnIghTxXx are extremely common.
* If you speak English in champ select there is a %50 chance they will worship you as a prophet of Faker, and %50 chance they will flame/curse you in Turkish just because you don't understand any of it.
* No punishment for flaming, only automated chat bans.
* People take the game too seriously, some guy stabbed his premade in a PC Cafe near where i live for 'picking Yasuo'. XJ9 level shit.
* There are special sales for Turkish server only.
* In registered PC cafes, all champions are unlocked for everybody, even in ranked (TR dota now?)
* The amount of Rengar/Zed/Yasuo/Lee Sin etc. wannabes are astounding in every elo.
* Also Kat and Akali are somewhat popular despite being trash tier atm.
* A guy flamed me once because i took enemy turret 'too early' so he can't tower dive now..
* 'I have an escape spell so i don't need to take flash'
* Leona has always been a permaban since 3 seasons. I saw people flame, dodge and afk because enemy picked Leona.
* Swearing is very very common.
* I had some guy afk because he took a smoke break.
* No even matches, either the enemy team throws/feeds or yours.",165

"I tried to do the math in another thread.  Reposting it here:

Okay... I'm going to try to do some math.

So Kindred E had one point in it at that time (I did confirm) as well as 74 AD. The damage from this would be 80 + 20% AD + 5% max HP. Lee Sin was level 4 and would have had around 763 max health. So from just the E would be 80 + 14.8 + 38.5 = 133.3. The key thing to remember is this proc goes off with an auto-attack. So that's another 74 right there bumping it up to 207.3. Still not enough. Kindred was running fervor of battle though. It did not look like Kindred had any stacks from before attacking Lee Sin, so she would have 2 from a spell + 2 from autos. Thus Kindred was at 4 stacks (probably) at the time of the hit. 4 stacks at level 4 is an extra 12.8 damage. This makes it around 220 damage. Don't forget that Kindred also had a passive stack already giving an extra 1.5% current HP damage. We'll factor this in later. Next, we need to factor in masteries. Let's assume, just for sake of max damage, that he went increased ability damage, double-edged sword, bounty hunter (would have been +1%), and merciless. If we're doing this scenario, we will assume Lee Sin had just barely under 40% HP. This meant he had around 300 health. This gives us that 1.5% from the passive so we had a base damage before masteries of ~225 damage.

225 * 1.01 * 1.02 * 1.02 * 1.05 (I did sweep the 74 AD into the ability damage when it isn't, so this will be a few too much actually).

This puts us at 250 damage. Not quite the 300 target. Some have suggested however that he had 1% crit. If he did, that would be another 74 damage (plus multiplications, so like 80 instead). Now we're at 330 damage.

Issue is this is also before resistances. Lee would have had around 38 armor. With the fervor mastery, we know Kindred has 7% ArPen. So an effective ~35 armor. That is around 25% damage reduction, so Lee would only have taken around 250 damage.

So where'd the other 50 damage come from? Am I missing anything? Knowing Zven's runes/masteries would help.

TL;DR: Best damage I could get off would be around 250 damage after all calculations. Target damage for Lee's health for best case would be around 300 (since he looked around 40% health). Not sure where other 50 damage comes from.

EDIT: Oh yeah, I forgot about minion damage. If we say that maybe 4 casters hit him at the same time there, that could be another 50 damage definitely. If so, this was really the perfect storm.

EDIT 2:  Math is hard.  Fixed an addition (off by 3)

EDIT 3:  So Kindred had no crit rune, so it was not a crit.  Also, Lee Sin had closer to 360-400 health.  This means no extra damage from merciless.  Kindred did not have dangerous game, but Lee Sin did.  Also, supposedly more minions hit than I gave credit for, but that's much harder to calculate (how many exactly hit at that exact moment).",382

"Okay, this is pretty much just a low elo problem, but have you ever gotten that thing where you're top early in the game, and you have like 10 caster minions walking towards your tower, and then the jungler tries to gank?

You start walking down the lane to join in the gank, show some sign of commitment for your jungler so they don't decide that you're un-gank-for-able for the rest of the game. But then you're realizing that you're taking aggro from all the minions, who are forming a human wall like they're hippies protecting the Amazon Rainforest or something. You're just trying to look like a team player, and these minions are wailing at you like you killed their families, which in all fairness, you probably did.

So you've got your Warwick getting pounded up the lane, and about a five minute walk away you're chilling back, at like 30% health from minions that are more farmed than you are, and you're faced with the dilemma of whether you push through and show up with 10% health to protect your jungler and probably feed a double kill, or retreat in humiliation under your turret, praying that the next wave doesn't have a cannon minion that can probaby single handedly turret dive you.

Last time this happened, I was on Irelia, and I just backed off to farm under turret. I basically just left the jungler to fend for themselves like, ""Well, you walked into this situation yourself, so it's your problem now I guess.""

Judging from the fact that Steve has done this before, it might have been a joke.”

It’s only a little worrying that the writers at leaguepedia said that “it might have been a joke.” So it might not? So a professional league of legends player MAY have tried to commit homicide on stream? And why exactly does repeating stabbing threats give them any sort of levity? 

Our first direction of this draft had the Team Liquid management eating its players. We’re still not sure why we ever thought that may have been a good idea.

I’d say that Team Liquid is having a meltdown, but I don’t think liquid can do that.

"Super awesome? Absolutely. Really hard to make it visually and thematically appropriate, though while not entering the realm of spaghetti. Lets say we do the portal trick. For something like jinx ult, just change whose team it is on and change its direction; fine, fine. But what about something like a blitz hook? Where does the hooked person go? To blitz? To the portal? Watch the blitz code get destroyed to make that work. What does it look like? Our imagination of the hook flying through the portal, and blitzcrank's arm appearing on the other side, is probably nothing at all like how the current code would do it. So you have to rewrite blitz' hook entirely to account for this portal ability. Then multiply that by every single creative skillshot in the game. Here's a list of those that occur to me immediately:
Vel' Koz Q

Thresh hook

Amumu bandage

Orianna's Q and E

Ahri's charm (who do they run to???) and orb

Ekko's Q

Gnar's Q

Diana's moonblade thing.

It'd be totally awesome, I agree on that, but that list was about 30 seconds of thinking. And each one would require some really difficult code = spaghetti and weird interactions.",131

"Hi, I made a post about this last week which I will re-post here. I completely agree with you, and have been thinking this since last season pre-worlds. I think that Cloud 9 is not hiring the support that their players need. Its pretty obvious that much of the difference with and without Hai is due to a psyche or mindset. All of the players on C9 currently are great and amazing talents, particularly in solo q and even in past seasons, nobody can deny that. I think that C9 needs a serious change in support staff to try and solve this problem ""with and without Hai"" because honestly, it shouldn't even be happening.


Recently I have seen the way Fnatic coaches with their staff and players and I think it's fantastic. I think everyone should check it out and see how it really helps Fnatic. Its obvious from just watching the first 10 minutes of the video that Fnatic is benefiting from having a supportive coaching staff and a life coach/sports psychologist. I think this would be extremely beneficial for Cloud 9 to have and finally bring them to their full potential.

"Ive defended riot a lot but i have never seen a more ignorant decision made by them. And yes, it is ignorant. Ranked is not for casual players who ""might try it if they could play with their friends""

Normals still have MMR. Dynamic didnt fail in hots because of the playerbase. There is no end to how out of touch with reality Riot has to be to believe that is the case. For all the good data they think they have, for all the ways people just dont like change, **this is not that**

At the end of the day, solo Ranked is for people who **care about their rank.**

How they cant understand this i'll never know. 

Especially when the integrity of the entire ranked system is crippled. If singles and duos can play vs full 5s regularly, the system has not achieved its goals in any way. Riot needs to stop acting like everything they do with game modes is completely unique in circumstance from every other moba. 

I will not be playing ranked in the current system. Did they ever ask people who do play ranked how they would feel playing solos vs 5 mans in all their poorly thought out surveys?

"I actually had a video made for this, but never posted it because Windows Movie Maker is terrible and murdered the FPS.

&amp;nbsp;

What I found is that **1) This bug only happens on jungle monsters**.  
OP did it with Garen on jungle mobs. A previous reddit post also did it with Garen on jungle mobs. When I tried it, I did it with Aatrox on jungle mobs. After numerous attempts, a crit **never** missed (with 100% chance) on a Champion or minion.

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, for Aatrox, the bug happens right after he triggers his empowered Autoattack from his W - regardless which version of his W. **2) Aatrox's next AA after a W-empowered AA will never crit** if you have 100% crit chance (and, I assume, also if you have less than 100%). In OP's video, the circumstances are remarkably similar: **3) Garen's next AA after a Q-empowered AA will never crit**.

&amp;nbsp;

Keep in mind that when I tested this, it was at the very end of Season 5, so there is a chance something changed since then. I'm considering re-doing the experiment and posting a video, but since OP's already done it, it may be redundant. Or it may be karma whoring; I'm not familiar with reddiquette over this matter.",157

Compare that to Barrier - just a shield that lasts 2 seconds and that's all.

"The reason why Froggen and Freeze couldn't play last week in NA and the reason Diamond can't play in EU are the same. This is not US or Germany's fault, this is Riots fault and this needs to be known.

They changed rules, so now players need to have work visas in order to play in LCS. Of course they did that in Riot way - last second and not thinking about possible outcomes.

EDIT 1. Riots communication with top orgs is way better than with the new ones, thats why they have no problems. TSM, C9, TL reported to Riot that Freeze, Froggen, Kfo had tourist visas, that's why this stuff happened. 

EDIT 2. The difference is that Froggen and Freeze will be able to play soon, which probably isn't true for Diamondprox since it's easier to get working Visa for russian guy in NA (that's why Alex is still playing) than in EU.

EDIT 3. I don't have enough time to answer every question, If you want more info or know what my source is check Beyond the Lane podcast for Daily Dot, where they talk about this issues with manager of Huma http://www.twitch.tv/dailydot/v/37670500 (probably the only existing public source right now) and there is also interview with Rick Fox done by Travis. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0RkXDPx2co

EDIT 4. FFS ppl stop attacking me for no reason. I only said that Riot forced those changes last moment, thats why orgs have issues with it (IMT, NRG had the same but they dealt with it faster). UOL was informed about this last week and IMO that is pretty bad I'm not saying that Riot did this on purpose... The main problem and this is where my issue with Riot starts is that they stated 3 years ago, that there will be no more problems with Visas for players and they solved it. Since than we had Dexter in fail, Bjergsen going back to EU for renewal, Wembley without Gambit and now LCS without Gambit. If you can't solve it, don't state that the problem is dealt.

""A long time ago (season one or maybe season two?) before the witchhunting rules were in place someone posted that we didn't deliver on prizes. If you didn't know, back then we used to give Razer gear to the #1 play of our Top 5s. We tried our best to dispute it, offering proof that we did send in fact send the prize but our name was tarnished. Ever since that post none of our videos ever made it to front/second page anymore. Funny thing is the guy lived in the Netherlands and just didn't pick up his package from the post office... we got the package back within a week or so from when he made the post and it had a stamp/sticker that said it was never picked up =/ We even offered to resend it to him (which is about $40 from the US) but he never got back to us after we emailed him.

2. Gaming has almost always been linked to Japan directly or in some ephemeral sense. Japanese video game publishers are at the core of most 20-something to 30-something gamers' childhooods, so there's a certain respect/nostalgia that rose-tinges the way we see Japan around video games.
3. It's a profession there (VAing I mean) that is far more ""mainstream"" than it is here. Like esports in Korea, people get obsessive about things that aren't cultural norms in the West but *are* in the East.

That said, I am glad that Bjerg isn't shot-calling anymore. He's always been a strong solo-laner that does best when he focuses on his high mechanical floor, his outplay potential and helping his team succeed through sheer dominance. Having the best roaming support/shot-caller in the west to help aid with that, as well as one of the most powerfully aggressive junglers, should lead to some crazy snowball wins for TSM.

The only real issue is whether or not Sven can learn to ward properly or not, and given that he's got two splits to learn before worlds, I'm confident that he and the new TSM will be strong western contenders for worlds.",155

"Here's an old post I made a long time ago to illustrate whats going on.

&gt;It's not Thresh's hook guys. Every move in the game has a hitbox, and hit boxes are usually circles or rectangles. It's impossible to perfectly fit those shapes to something like a hook, so sometimes it seems like it barely missed you, but still hit you.

&gt;That's not the worst of it. The worst offender is simply how champion hitboxes  (which slightly overextend the model of the champion) can barely nick the edge of a skillshot's hitbox, making it look like it clearly missed you. Plus the usual lag/spectator bugs/delay can add to moments like this.

&gt;Here's probably what the hitboxes look like.  http://i.imgur.com/nITDqiv.png

&gt;It made me realize it's probably just because LoL doesn't rotate the boxes and champions turns around. So corners can clip in cases like these. In reality every champion is just a box that runs around the rift and shoots little boxes to attack, and the art tries to represent where all of these boxes are. But not everything perfectly fits the shape of a box. The models/art/particle effects themselves colliding is not what decides if a move connects or not.


I assume Lissandra's hitbox is just fat and she got caught by the very corner of Thresh's hook's hitbox.",202

"Rework her. Her entire kit doesn't really allow balance effectively.

The only thing that should be kept is the reset mechanic in someway shape or form (because it's fairly iconic to her theme) and blade lotus should be kept but can be applied in any shape way or form. 

It's not probable to balance a no-cc/utility champion with extreme cleanup potential because even if she ever becomes balanced in certain levels, that means that there'd probably be a chance that she's too strong lower elo levels. 

At the moment it's not fun to play a champion that loses 98% of lanes and has low impact unless spoonfed kills by the jungler or attempting to turn overzealous sidelane play through the use of tp. The repeated nerfs to her make it so that there's not really even outplay potential on her kit anymore, it's really just up to the enemy to mess up and you to pray you can capitalize on it.

I'd prefer they put a reset mechanic only on her mobility move so they can accurately balance her base damage values in line with normal mages since that means that her cleanup potential actually has effective counterplay AND she can actually scale off of another stat (cdr). ",483
"Definitely agreed. I've played around 20 games on the new system, half solo, half with friends. There was only one game where people were somewhat negative, and considering how clearly tilted everyone was that game I would have expected it to be far worse.

Even had one game where all 5 of us were in the same lobby three dodges in a row, so we ended up bonding and joking around about how we are pretty much a pre-made 5 now (all strangers), and we had one of the best, cleanest wins of my life. It was great.

"Price reduced from 1000 to 800 so they're now the same price as Mobi's but grant you more consistently high MS, especially when in combat (when Mobi's are useless). Merc Treads got nerfed and Tabi is not as useful because armour items were all buffed (so you may as well buy an armour item and then get the incredibly cost efficient swifties instead of Tabi). I'd argue you get Swifts on almost every Jungler/Support. You'd get them on MF specifically because she doesn't really scale with AS but much moreso AD so berserkers are less important, and her lack of mobility gives her a reliance on positioning by regular movement. The combined MS of Swifties &amp; her W gives her a really high MS for kiting. It's just a really good buy on her for how cheap they are. You also max E&gt;W&gt;Q on MF so you get AS steroid in your W quite early.",120

Worse, the old Ranked 5s allowed for people to make many teams at once, meaning that top-tier players trying to get to Challenger would make a team and then work up the ladder, immediately disbanding if they happened to lose a game, and then start over again with a new team.

This can be shown by trying to queue with someone who went from gold&gt;plat while you yourself are diamond. It will tell you that they are not between the correct divisions. 



Also it seems anyone who had there borders taken from them is not allowed to queue with anyone higher than gold for some reason. This just backs up the theory that the MMR soft reset was incorrectly done. This one is pretty exploitable (dia+ queueing with bronze?).

"Quick note, I think there was a sync issue and some of the post is cut (or it was just too long). This is the missing section:

---

One pain point has been lock in failures in new champ select resulting in queue dodges. This issue compounded with the longer queue times of the initial launch for a pretty miserable experience. We believe the lock in requirement is worth sticking with because it encourages players to stay engaged with their team while drafting, and pushes overall time in champ select lower. Lock in failures are already trending downwards, but remind your friends to lock in during the first few days with new champ select! We expect to see this stabilize over the first two weeks of the system, and if it doesn’t, we’ll move quickly to address it.

Finally, we’re also aiming at a number of updates to new champ select and all dynamic queues over the next couple of patches. We’ll keep you posted on each of these in the patch notes, as well as matchmaking tune-ups and bug fixes:

* Chroma and ward skin selection
* Skin purchase in champ select
* Preventing pick intent from being displayed to opponents during the final pick phase
* Allowing players to bring the champion grid back up after a champion pick
* Further improving the dynamic soundtrack
* Matchmaking will better prioritize your primary position

"Renegades were originally founded as Misfits, a strong-willed and ambitious challenger team comprised of a mixed bag of solo queue standouts and former LCS professionals. Determined to qualify for the North American LCS, the hungry bunch adopted the Renegade mantle, embracing a fresh identity and ideology along the way.

&amp;nbsp;

Riding the encouraging support of our fans, we remained resilient until the final whistle, defeating Team Coast in five games in the NACS finals. As Renegades, our passage into North America’s most competitive League of Legends circuit was successful, becoming the then-newest members of the NA LCS.

&amp;nbsp;

None of which could be possible without the out pour of support of our growing fan base. Whether you’re rocking our trademark bandanna or simply sharing uplifting messages on social media, our drive for excellence is fueled by you, our supporters. We couldn’t and wouldn’t have it any other way.  You are worth every battle.

&amp;nbsp;

While assembling Misfits, every member had a bit to prove. But as Renegades, now inhabitants of the LCS, we look to challenge North America’s most talented League of Legends teams in history knowing full well, as has always been the case, we will have to come together to achieve our dreams. We embrace the challenges we are about to face as we continue our growth in hopes of offering you, the fans, something meaningful and true. They’ll be hurdles along the way, but no victories are won without a battle.

&amp;nbsp;

“Now that Renegades is in the LCS, we all have a strong desire to drive the team forward towards being as good as good is,” says Crumbz. “The benchmark for that is of course the NA LCS, any losses will only make us learn faster to get to that goal. To be honest I have never had the experience to have many fans, but while the organization is new it certainly doesn’t feel that way with so much loving support.”

&amp;nbsp;

“It is an honor to be in the start of something great. Thank you for all your support,” he added.

&amp;nbsp;

Our next adventure begins Saturday when we take on the Team Liquid at 3:00 p.m to kick off our inaugural LCS split. Get your red bandanas ready.

&amp;nbsp;

There’s a long road ahead, but when hasn’t there been? It won’t be easy.

"This is my first time posting on reddit even though I discovered this forum in 2014.

I have been playing League of Legends since season 3. 

I've read all the posts FOR and AGAINST Dynamic queue. 

1) 

At the end of the day solo queue players are at an inherent disadvantage; so how does this make me feel? I'm being told that at the expense of myself others can have a better time playing this game. So you don't value me as a customer; that's ok.

2) Even if I find a group of premades to play with and reach diamond this rank means nothing to me (currently platinum); the value of rank is decreased. I am not excited and will not be playing 500+ ranked games this season to try to get diamond.

3) I play LoL only for solo queue. You may be surprised by how many people who don't enjoy this game but play to prove them self.


Conclusion: This new change essentially ignores all the values of those players who are addicted to mindlessly grinding the ranked solo q ladder. There's really nothing left for them in League.

Opinion: If Riot believes this is the best approach for the game, I respect that but I'll have to quit. I am not saying this out of anger but there is no future for players like us in this game. They simply removed all the reasons for why a certain group of people play this game.",401

"To stay on the ground, the matchup is horrible. Lissandras big weakness is an early spectres cowl and a counter pick is Olaf who can do dmg while building tanky, ignore all the CC and build spectres first item. Spectres alone reduces lissandras harass to nothing (less than 50% dmg taken).

OG had the chance to pick another top lane, let lissandra mid (hard matchup but not as hard) and either send Trundle top who is pretty strong there and counters Olaf or get any other top lane still open.

I think that desicion did cost them the game in the end. You could see how much dmg Lissandra did to Olaf in that mid lane fight where Gamsu took nearly 2 kills. Close to an AA.

Also a Zac + Olaf combo with Leblanc in the back line just goes in but is not easy to lock down or burst with all the magic dmg and no DPS to back it up.

Double AP is something you don't play in such situations, especially when you got a bot lane Ez with blue build who needs time to get running.

edit2: Posting more clarification from [Riot G-Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/40thyj/champion_update_shen/cywym9c) for visibility

&gt; To clarify Spirit Blade idle behavior:

&gt; * Spawns next to you at game start and respawn
&gt; * Despawns on death
&gt; * Snaps to your position when using any global teleport (Shen ult, recall, Tahm ult, etc.)
&gt; * Snaps towards you (but still pretty far away) if you move very far from it (talking off-screen distances here--keeps Q cast times manageable without affecting on-screen play)
&gt; * Q turns it into a homing missile towards you, and it lands on the ground when it reaches you

From my perspective he locked in the Draven, and still had heal, so we assumed he wasn't respecting assigned roles.

He did switch to smite after this screenshot and played the game as jungle draven. While it wasn't the greatest pick, it wasn't a troll pick either as **he legitimately played the game and tried to win**.

He doesn't deserve a ban for picking a non-conventional jungler, as that's what happened in the end.

Adc - Stocky build so probably **Keith**  
Sup - this is the one I'm most uncertain about. **Baby** ?  
  
There also has been speculation about Xpecial and Nien playing together so this might mean Baby or another support is the one in the photo, leaving the other duo to play for Impulse or a challenger team.   
  
**Edit:**  
   
After observing the op.gg closely here is what I speculate:  
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=tinker  
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=haluansinua  
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=aniviakid  
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=kothmcbroff  
  
These were all clearly kfo, Hard, Froggen, and Keith respectively based on summoners, runes, champs, etc. Others have also found this to be true.  
  
The big mystery is the support. 2 games were played in ranked 5's with this player:  
https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=ballsinyourface  
  
Now although it looks like this account doesn't fit, I still believe it is the support playing, but on an old alternate or friend's account.    
  
Here's the biggest reason why:   
Their 2nd 5v5 ranked game involved many role swaps in the perceived team  
* Vladimir - Hard  
* Lee Sin - kfo  
* Yasuo - Froggen  
* Ashe - *support*  
* Bard - Keith  
  
The big indicator for me is that kfo is a Vlad main and Hard is a Lee main. Keith playing support and the perceived support playing adc makes me believe the players either role swapped or swapped their computers and played on each others' accounts. Maybe I'm just thinking too **Hard** ... who knows ? :D

"Edit: Thanks for your questions Wildcard, and your patience with me taking my time in answering them. I like the challenging questions - you certainly deliver on that front.

1) Riot's involvement in each region will vary based on the partner we have in that region. In Korea (as you're well aware being a big OGN/LCK fan), there are two partners we work with to run pro esports in that region - KeSPA and OGN. In LMS, we work with Garena. Each region has a local team laser-focused on understanding the needs of that region and working with partners (or without, in the regions where we don't have partner) to make the best decisions possible. Examples of those types of decisions historically have been things like ""what streaming platforms or TV channels should we be on?"" or ""what should our minimum salary be, if any?"" or ""should we have game 5 blind pick?"" or ""what should our branding be for the league?"" 

The ""gotcha"" here is that esports is global and many decisions in a particular region influence other regions. Esports competitive rulings used to just be a local region thing, but that's changed subtly over the past couple years as we got feedback from fans who pointed to rulings from other regions as precedents. In this case, regions must work together (with the help of some of our team members here in LA who focus on global issues) to achieve global consistency. The bans you've reference in LMS are a great example of what can happen without that broad cooperation - it might've made sense to the team running LMS but understandably looked strange to esports fans who were used to a different set of punishments. One of our goals for LMS next year is to work far more closely with them on rulings to align to what's implemented elsewhere, and in the next couple of weeks we'll be sharing more information on how globally we'll be looking to achieve more consistency on rulings. With respect to whether or not you can hold us accountable, we consider ourselves responsible for the quality of the esports experience globally, whether we're working with a partner or not.

2) There are a couple things you bring up here that I'll try to unpack. I'd consider MSI a ""real"" international tournament and one we're buffing up this year by extending group stages and making it a two-week event. With respect to their format, ESL wanted (and we agreed) to invite certain teams (TSM, Fnatic) to their tournaments as they're big-name teams. We don't want international tournaments for the sake of international tournaments - we like each event having meaning and build-up (MSI = spring champions tournament, Worlds = end of year mega-tournament, All-Stars = fun event for fans with lots of fan interaction). League of Legends in IEM is in a weird place right now - it doesn't really have an identity, and that's something we are working with ESL to improve on. We'd like to get back to qualifiers for IEM and we'd like to figure out a format that's more unique vis-a-vis other international events. An example of a cool idea we liked this past year is the pro-amateur event in the spirit of Demacia Cup and KeSPA cup, but it's something we're still working on.

3) Age limit is an issue that reflects what I addressed in the first answer on global issue vs. local issue. In a vacuum, I'm sure certain regions having a different (or no) age restriction makes sense based on local traditions. It's also easy to see how fans in a different region facing a team in an international tournament with a different set of restrictions would call it unfair (and we agree there). We could just put limits on international tournaments, but what about teams that use those restricted players to qualify for tournaments? At some point with age limits, it's cleaner and more fair from a competitive aspect to establish a global policy that all leagues agree to and go from there. Broadly speaking, it's fair to say that Riot's had a hand in establishing a unified age limit across all leagues. A lot of the benefits of having an age restriction are necessary and behind-the-scenes - 17 avoids labor restrictions in certain countries, it pushes pros to finish basic schooling, etc.

4) Saying that putting restrictions on player movement between regions (2 foreign players max) leading to helping keep talent in Korea is absolutely a fair statement. Korea is an exporter of talent - players leaves to play elsewhere, and it's not hard to make the assumption that without the ""2 per team"" cap, you'd see more Korean players playing abroad. It's straightforward on why most Koreans pros go abroad - China (and to a lesser degree NA) is willing to pay way more for talent and thus they lure away top talent. Korea was unified in supporting us pushing that policy through. Salaries in Korea will go up - they have, but slower than we'd like. That, and the restrictions on inter-regional movement has helped slow the outflow, especially compared to 2014. 

In terms of sister teams in the future, OGN doesn't have unilateral control over LCK. They work in conjunction with Riot's Korean team and KeSPA to shape the league. Given what I know about the landscape there, bringing sister teams back isn't a major issue and I don't see it happening (at least in the near future). 

As an aside, it's interesting that despite the lack of sister teams and the player exodus, Korea's incredibly competitive (see: Worlds) and entertaining to watch (viewership is up, at home and abroad). Salaries are up as well (although again, there's still more that can be done here).

5) Edit: Blue_Card thoughtfully dug up the comment he referenced claiming I said that OGN made the call to remove sister teams. ""I'm not sure where the ""it's worse"" mentality is coming from. But I assume it's in reference to the split system, elimination of sister teams and the new league format. Those changes - along with double round robin Bo3s - were all locally driven. Korean LoL esports is in a much more stable state than it's ever been before.""

To help understand why OGN can oppose something and it still happen in LCK, it's important to know how the governance of LCK works. LCK is governed by three groups - Riot, KeSPA and OGN. They work together to make the best decision for how LCK is run, the rules, etc. In this case, when I said ""locally driven"" - I was referencing that the group (OGN, KeSPA and Riot) made the call. Just because OGN opposes something doesn't mean it can't happen to the LCK, as KeSPA and Riot also have a say there.",207

"Don't mistake this overreaction for ""this is how you can handle your cats if you want"" though. While the outrage is overstated and based on the (I assume) misconception that she tried strangling her cat, this video showed very poor handling of the cats.

To all cat owners: Scruffing is a last resort when handling an adult cat that is difficult to pick up by lifting under the belly. A kitten past 4-6 weeks old is too heavy to lift by the scruff.  You risk putting a dangerous amount of pressure on their delicate necks that can result in a spinal injury and possibly restrict blood flow to their brain. You should always support the cat's entire body whenever you lift it.  

And the ""I want to show her who's boss"" by scruffing it isn't recommended or effective as a means of discipline or as a way to dominate a cat either. It was never used for that purpose by the mother and will only cause them to become fearful, struggle and get hurt.",134

"First, let me say that having the European sports culture analogy in the announcement certainly wasn’t our finest hour in terms of messaging. Here’s some context that should hopefully convey our thought process a little clearer.

Bo2 is a well established and proven format that has been successfully used in various major regions and other Esports. The same can certainly be said for Bo3, and we fully acknowledge that both formats have their pros and cons and in the end it’s a question of prioritisation and preference. 

To boil it down to the essentials, here are three major points that we consider strong merits of Bo2:
(1) Equal amount of matches on blue/red side for all teams: Bo2 is a symmetrical format that will ensure the same amount of total matches for every team as well as and one blue and one red side match for every series.
(2) Predictability of start times for matches: With global Esports content becoming more and more accessible, we expect content consumption patterns to further move towards picking and choosing the matches and teams you want to watch, as opposed to sitting through a full 5-6 hour session. With that in mind, predictability of live match start times as well as VOD viewing experience improvements are high on our priority list.
(3) Importance of each individual game: In Bo2, every win will be worth at least 1 point, regardless of the outcome of the series. This rewards consistent winning over the course of our 9-week regular season and will allow weaker teams to score points vs stronger ones, as well as keep stronger teams on their toes for every match.

During a recent pro player conference in EU, the majority of players were in favor of Bo2 over Bo3. This is not to say that Bo2 is the ultimate format and better than Bo3 in all regards - a lot of players liked Bo3 as well.

We will closely monitor the upcoming Summer Split and utilise all available venues of feedback to assess whether the format meets our, the viewers’ and the teams' expectations and are ready to re-evaluate for 2017 if necessary.",229

"I like to call this phenomenon Anonymous Skill Syndrome or A.S.S. It's absolutely a game killer. Every game that I've ever seen dies when they implement features that anonymize an individuals ability. Why this happens is psychological in nature and if Lyte weren't busy trying to make everyone feel good about themselves he would have done research into this.

ASS is most commonly seen in the system design process. For GW2 ASS was implemented heavily in Open World PvP. There were 3 forms of ASS. The first being anonymized opponents, the only way to bestow recognition (through targeted gameplay) would be the work around of attempting to report a player to see who killed you which was an after the fact remedy and couldn't be relied upon. The second was lack of kill spam, this prevented people on your own team from recognizing your skill and the frustration it lead to with unwillingness to cooperate. The third was the downed system, which was essentially second chance pvp.

When you are unable to ascertain your skill comparatively to your peers. There is no basis for continuing to compete. ",187

"As a hypercarry I feel like he's outclassed by Vayne/Tristana/Jinx. They have more DPS (because Kog's W makes his AAs do 55% damage) and can survive better with mobility. Honestly that 55% penalty is just too brutal, even if he can fully abuse the AS bonus (which is extremely unlikely), it only yields 110% more damage, and crit damage is massively reduced too. For me 60/65% would be ideal.

Additionally, he is too reliant on protection. To fully abuse the AS benefits he has to stand still and attack, which is basically asking to get engaged on and killed. Problem is, he basically HAS to do this just to not *lose* DPS. Something like a Malphite ult will absolutely destroy him. Because of that, Juggermaw comps are basically teams designed to protect and buff Kog, such as Lulu top, Nunu jungle, Morgana mid and Janna support. It's actually surprisingly viable, check [this game] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7QImB1GewE&amp;ab_channel=OPLOLReplay) out. He can single-handedly carry a whole team if done correctly, but I don't expect this to work in soloqueue. Yes that is pre-rework Kog'Maw, but that's what he's supposed to do. Right now, however, I think he's definitely weaker than before.",300

"I'm sure there will be lots of complaints because reddit hates literally any changes riot makes (while also constantly demanding Riot make changes). But personally I've very excited and happy about this. Pre-game bullshit and fighting over who gets what role was one of the main reasons I avoided soloque completely and only played ranked teams in S5. Looking forward to being able to play soloqueue again without having to deal with the guy who's pissed he got stuck with support so he takes Master Yi and feeds like a champ.

Plus, the main argument against it - League is about being a good all-around player! - is dumb. There's a reason that every single pro LOL team in existence has set players for each role rather than just using pick order to decide who gets mid every game. The roles are very different, and people specialize in one or another to develop role-specific skills. It happens in basically every sport or game with different positions. Do you expect a soccer goalie to also be a good striker? Do you expect a  football quarterback to also be a competent defensive lineman? No. And the fact that the quarterback can't also play defensive lineman decently at his quarterback skill level doesn't make him a bad player or a ""one trick pony.""

Specialization is *good* - when players pick roles and specialize in them, *the overall level of play goes up*. If you like playing random roles, you can still do that, but many others would prefer to specialize and learn one or two roles, in the same way that a high school quarterback doesn't want to show up to practice one day and be told he's going to play as the punter in the next game. Allowing that to happen raises the overall level of play, and that's good for everyone. 

Plus, with everyone always playing what they wanted to play, there should be slightly less toxicity (though there will still be plenty, it just won't be sparked by ""I called mid!"" ""No I called it first!"" childish bullshit).",341

"To take this to the extreme (not that extreme, I'm sure there will be plenty of examples) consider two players who both reach Gold 1 rating.

Player A only ever plays alone. Player B always plays as part of his 5 man group. 

According to Riot the matchmaking should ensure Player A only plays with other solo players/small groups whilst Player B nearly always plays vs other 5s (I know this ISN'T happening but I'm giving Riot the benefit of the doubt here that they'll sort it).

Player A can pretty much never be matched against Player B. The entire population of players they play against is different. The game mode they are playing is essentially different, almost to the point of being different games (solo queue is so *vastly* different from 5s it's ridiculous).

Despite all this they are both ""Gold 1"". How in the name of all fuck are their ratings comparable? How can those two players be together on the same ladder with the 'same' rating? How can Riot keep a straight face whilst claiming that's reasonable?

It's an absolute fucking joke of a system. All the people saying it will be 'tweaked' need to pull their heads out of their arses - it's fundamentally flawed by design due to this (and a couple of other reasons).

I am staggered by Riot's arrogance that they thought this was good to release despite it failing so miserably in HOTs to be honest.",2145

"Thanks for the thread and thanks to everyone for their feedback over the years.

It's always a weird thing to balance. I want to always bring as many things as possible to the cast. I want to bring my knowledge as a diamond ADC and shotcaller, I want to bring my love of the game via the excitement in my calls, I want to bring my incredibly nerdy love of math, and I want to bring the humor I've enjoyed that arises from the League of Legends and the gaming community at large. I think it's always good to stand out and be unique. Not for uniqueness's sake or anything, but just to make sure you're paving your own path and not just copying others.

Its made even stranger by the fact that, honestly, if no one has negative opinions on you, you aren't doing nearly enough. There are people who hate League of Legends, even though it's one of the most popular games of all times. Everyone has their own favorite and least favorite players, commentators, games, foods, everything. You don't want to be forgettable as a commentator; it's your job to bring your perspective and energy to the game. And I always want to be ""me.""

 **The 2016 Ranked Season: Updates on Dynamic Ranked and your feedback**

&gt;Last week, we began initial tests of new champ select, dynamic queue, and a new matchmaking system in North America and Turkey. Driven by the desire to try new features, we saw millions of games played and more ranked games than any preseason before. Compared to last preseason, as a percentage of total games played, the rate of Normal Draft games vaulted by 264%, and Ranked increased by 45%. We’ve also heard tons of feedback, and had our fair share of issues. With all that in mind, let’s share what we learned and what we’re doing for the 2016 Ranked Season, which kicks off around the world over the next 24 hours.  
&gt;  
&gt;Historically, Ranked Solo/Duo was the place where similarly-skilled players came together to express raw mechanical skill, encyclopedic game knowledge, and their own ability to carry. On the other hand, players told us over and over again they wanted a more competitive experience they could play with friends that lacked the rigid barriers to entry and low queue population of Ranked Teams.   
&gt;  
&gt;This led us to Dynamic Ranked, where you can queue up with as many friends as you’d like, as long as all party members are within one tier of each other. This new approach to ranked adds team play and even team leadership to the mix of skills mentioned above.   
&gt;  
&gt;So we had two distinct visions for Ranked play in League, Solo/Duo and Dynamic. The easiest solution might seem like just adding the new queue, but segmenting players can be extremely risky because of potential queue time and match quality issues. These risks compound on servers with smaller populations that can only sustain two queues (currently Normal Blind &amp; Ranked Solo/Duo in those regions).   
&gt;  
&gt;Because a broad majority of players have voiced their opinion through their engagement, we’re kicking off the 2016 Ranked Season with Dynamic Queues. But there’s a bit more to talk about.  
&gt;  
&gt;We also heard from some players who prefer to solely measure themselves against all comers. We’re sensitive to any large swath of players feeling like they’re losing their place in League and while we firmly believe in Dynamic Ranked as the future, the game’s social features don’t offer enough support for players looking for like-minded, similarly-skilled players today. Because of this, we’ll launch a new Solo Ranked Queue (no duo’s!) in the coming weeks.   
&gt;  
&gt;We need to work out a few implementation details, especially for smaller servers before we can roll out the revamped Solo Ranked alongside its Dynamic sibling. Because Dynamic Ranked is an indisputably better experience for playing with friends, the Ranked Teams queue skips the 2016 season while we begin work to integrate the full team experience into Dynamic Ranked. Expect more details about improved organized play later in the year. To be clear, ranked queues for the 2016 season are:  
&gt;  
&gt;* Dynamic Ranked  
&gt;* A few weeks after season start: Solo Ranked  
&gt;  
&gt;Some of you are probably wondering about Ranked Rewards, and because we’ve pivoted to supporting Dynamic and Solo Ranked, we’re still figuring them out ourselves. Expect most of the Ranked Rewards to shift to Dynamic Ranked and some concrete news in the first few months of the season.  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the course of the last week, even up to Monday morning, we’ve made matchmaking upgrades for normal and ranked dynamic queues and the new tech allows for better monitoring and on the fly tuning than ever before. Marked improvements in overall match quality and queue times should already be making themselves felt on live. Here’s what we know after nearly a week of live testing:   
&gt;  
&gt;* Premade 4’s are now matching with other Premade 4’s in 98% of their matches, while Premade 5’s are matching with other Premade 5s in 96% of their matches. These numbers are up from the mid-80’s at launch.  
&gt;* We’re seeing queue times for high-skill and pro players drop dramatically and are working on further improvements.  
&gt;* Most players should now be seeing more competitive (where competitive means each team is [equally likely to win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details)) matches compared to the Solo/Duo Ranked queue from last season.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 2016 Ranked Season kicks off in NA at 2AM PST on 1/20. GL HF in your placements!

His game knowledge will surely help Dardoch fill his shoes!

I hope TLA can find a good replacement, as well. 

Edit: Here's the rest of the article since the website got the hug of death.

&gt;Liquid’s Christian ""IWillDominate"" Rivera announced today his decision to retire from competitive play. IWD has spent the last year filling the jungle spot for Liquid, after moving to the organization along with the rest of the former Team Curse roster upon the two teams' merger in January 2015. Over the duration of his stay with Liquid, IWD represented the organization in 64 competitive games, leading the team to two consecutive third place finishes in the LCS playoffs and a first place ranking during the regular season of the 2015 summer split. He will continue to work with the team to coach his successor, Joshua ""Dardoch"" Hartnett, and produce content.

&gt;In announcing his retirement, IWillDominate made the following statement:

&gt;*Following Saturday's match vs Renegades I made my final decision to retire from my position as a professional League of Legends player.  After 5 years of playing this game professionally I have chosen a different path and will no longer compete weekly at LCS.  In the immediate future i'll continue to work with TL in content/streaming as well as working as a positional coach to Dardoch, something that Dardoch personally requested of me.  I feel a responsibility to Dardoch to make sure that he is acclimated to LCS as best as possible, as I was the person who scouted him and am invested in his success.  The decision to retire has been on my mind since June of 2015 when I originally proposed bringing in a young talented jungler to grow into my role on TL.  I contacted Dardoch as he was a talented solo queue jungler that had gained my respect.  Over the last 4-5 months of working with Dardoch he has transitioned his solo queue strengths into competitive play and he has been playing better and better every week.  I am fully confident that with the support of the TL coaching staff he will be a contender for the title of Best Jungler NA and can lead the team to a top finish in Spring Split.*

&gt;*In the immediate future I will be playing with TLA for the first week of NACS as they look to find a suitable replacement for Dardoch.*

&gt;*Thank you to all my fans that supported me from DIG all the way to TL. I want all of you guys to know that throughout my career I tried my best to be the best player/team mate that I could. I have no regrets about my career. I hope that you guys can continue to support me in my future endeavors within Team Liquid.*

&gt;Steve ""LiQuiD112"" Arhancet, owner of Liquid, made the following statement:

&gt;*Dom has been a pleasure to work with over these last 3 years as a professional player. He has brought a lot of knowledge, dedication, hard work and personality to Curse and now Liquid.

People can find me tweeting about how shitty the name change survey was that player behavior put out several months ago. 

For years, I've been critical of certain decisions Riot has made on my shows. 

What I'm not interested in doing is playing into the narrative that Riot is some big evil company that wants to control anything and everything in esports because it's not true. That doesn't mean that they don't make mistakes, but they're one of the most competent companies in the industry. If I didn't believe in them, I would have little to no interest in actually covering this game. In fact, it's because I believe in them that I actually call this stuff out, because I know they care and are interested in improving.  

Sorry, I know this all comes across as defensive, and I appreciate that you enjoyed the content. I just get disappointed with this idea that I am not openly critical of them or other entities in the industry. ",131

I re-visited Hai's blog for the first time what I think are few months, and seems like I missed this blogpost. Whether it's him putting up a front to soothe the community or it's the honest truth we'll never know(I'd like to think it's the truth) but retirement seems to be farther back in his mind than before, and what especially gives me hope is

&gt; I've been thinking a lot too and trying to see if retirement is a thing that I'm still heavily interested in or not. While I think there are pros and cons for both playing/retiring, I'm not leaning towards retiring as hard as I did the previous year.

and even better,
&gt; With the season starting up within 2 weeks, I've been feeling the drive that once carried me to the top of the LCS standings. The fire that made me want to play is coming back, they come and go crashing like tsunami waves on my body.

So, he still wants to play - not for others' sake, but for his personal passion to compete and be victorious.

That aside - I don't think it's horrendous that C9 is giving Bunny time on live stage. I haven't been watching the LCK too religiously, but known fact is that since they use the Bo3 system in the regular seasons, many teams have tried out their rookies in one of those possibly three matches. If the rookie crashes and burns in the that match and the series victory is important to the team(ex. opponent is close to them in standings), the starter returns in the next match for a better chance at taking the series. Sometimes even that doesn't work and the team loses, but the point is that the rookie gets stage experience.

Sounds familiar, no? We would never know how Bunny would *truly* complement the team unless we threw him on stage to play. So far(uhh two matches. w00t small sample size) that hasn't worked out but I don't think we can fault C9 as an org for trying that out. I'm just salty LCS isn't Bo3 yet :(

"As usual, Riots biggest downfall and flaw is their pride. They just can't admit that they're wrong. 

Look, dynamic queue is a really cool idea and having a ranked ladder based on it makes sense. However, somehow Riot got it in their heads that everyone's top priority is to play with friends. It isn't. There's a megathread. There's 25% of players in their survey. Really Riot? 25% of surveyed players should just be told tough luck?

So many people say ""just make another queue/rank for solo play"". But Riot has a lot to lose here. They know damn well that as soon as they make a purely solo queue, that it will become the gold standard for establishing skill, and that dynamic queue will essentially be a joke. But they're too blind to see that it's already a joke. It sacrifices competitive integrity for the sake of fun with friends. We already know what it feels like to have a competitive solo queue experience, and it's a core part of League. 

If you're not convinced, think back to when Faker was being discovered. He was just this random guy who played really well in solo queue, and got the #1 spot on the ladder. With this new system, the top 20 spots at least will be full of existing pro players who only queue with their LCS teams. Solo queue will essentially become LCS scrims at the highest levels since pros make up so much of high challenger. And with this supposed 95% rule, good luck to the system trying to collect 10 random high challengers who arent grouped up. It hardly happens as is. Basically, Faker would have never been discovered if dynamic queue had existed back in 2012. 

Look Riot, we get that you want a better experience for groups of friends, and that's fine, but you're really messing up by stripping League of real solo queue and solo rankings. There are too many people who care about competitive integrity and want to prove their individual skill. ",609

"For those interested, the solution goes this way: (There must be other ways, but this is the way we're supposed to do it)

To solve this sort of problem you need to express both variables with one variable, and then solve it as a function and find its maximum point.
X will mark the gold spent on armor.
3600 - X will mark the gold spent on health.

The amount of armor bought then is X / 18, and the amount of health bought is (3600 - X) / 2.5.

The effective health can then be pronounced as 

(((3600 - X) / 2.5) * (100 + X/18)) / 100.

You then calculate the derivative and you find where the derivative turns zero. It happens on x = 900. You check that the point is actually a maximum by checking that the derivative before it is positive and after it is negative.

I avoid twitch chat but when streamers like meteos have an active chat with him actively participating to add to the entertainment, it's hard to avoid. It was  seriously hard to watch and I turned it off after like the 4th one donation he had to manually stop the reading off because they're just inhumane. I'm not sure what age group the donations are coming from but fuck man, they're brutal stuff. Even as a joke, it's like wow I actually thought for a second and that's fucked up.

1. When Riot used the trust-system with the Visas with all the teams, many of the teams were taking advantage of the system and were using imported players without required working Visas.  Now they are being punished for taking advantage of the system, and it's very unfortunate for the players who can't participate in LCS because of this issue.

2. The first thing we made sure when we signed Huni and Reignover was to get their P-1 Visas done before LCS season started.  We made sure the visa approval process was expediated and approved within the deadline so we did not have any problems.

All the hard-work they put into building hype and getting people excited, talking to us about how they can't wait for us to finally see/hear him, telling us how we're gonna love the champion, and so forth is all gone down the drain.

"1) We're working on the ability to browse Champions when you want.

2) We're working on filters that allow you to search Champions quicker, such as ""Recent Favorites"" and ""Mages"" or ""Fighters."" There is actually a lot of research on grids and displays that suggest that if you display too many items at once, you actually inhibit search times. So, although players say they want to see more champions at once, the time it takes to find the champion they want actually increases and it takes them longer. There's a field of visual neuroscience that studies effects like these called ""visual search"" which is pretty cool.

3) A lot of players like Pick Intent, they just want the phase to be faster (and we agree).

4) Although Picks are one at a time now, the overall Champ Select times are faster than old Champ Select. This is because we've reduced the timers on each individual decision, and are further reducing the times in the near future now that players are more used to the phases. For example, in the old Champ Select, many decisions were given 60s, and in the new one it's 40s.

5) This is a fine balance, because a lot of players love the aesthetics too. It might be a bit too much at times, and a bit noisy, and we're always working on cleaning up the clarity.

6) We're going to touch up some of the timer issues that irk players, such as the counters starting before players can actually act.",323

"in reality, it's no different from you seeing Veigar/Singed/other AoE effects have a 'red' lining where allies of those champions see them with a 'green' lining. What you're actually seeing are different particles entirely in those cases - other examples here I believe are Vel'Koz always seeing the stacks of Organic Deconstruction on his target, but other champions only seeing it once he procs all 3. It's a common tactic we use to make certain particles really 'pop' for the player without making them too loud for everyone else in-game.

THAT SAID - I can't speak for this champion's particles in this instance, and while I agree that idea sounds crazy cool, we usually stick very closely to keeping visuals consistent for each champion, especially w/ respects to particle readability. I'm not saying we'd never do this, but there's a lot of overhead - for instance, making 2 (or more) entire sets of particles for different parties increases clarity concerns (what if enemies could see Lucian's Culling perfectly, but Lucian himself couldn't gauge the actual hitbox? etc) as well as the grim reality of causing way more bugs, which is something we can't always ignore when heading into production.

TL;DR - we actually draw/spawn team/player only particles all the time, but they're usually enhanced/subdued versions of the same thing for consistency rather than entirely different for different perspectives.

"Hey guys, and welcome to my first vlog. Think I'll start making one every week since they are pretty easy to make, they don't take too long, since I am a man of few words, after all. But, regardless, why I wanted to make this particular vlog is I wanted to talk about my plans for 2016, which pretty much involves three things - League of Legends, obviously, Overwatch, and Spanish classes.

So, let's start with League of Legends. I'm obviously still gonna be playing League of Legends, since I do like the game, not as much as I used to, granted, but I like to play it casually and I'll be streaming some hours every day, hopefully. And I hope I'll be able to make more videos, even though I don't have that much time as last year, but I'll try to step up my game a bit, my video game a bit. And I do have a lot of fun making the videos, so that's always a good thing. Think that's pretty much about it, on the League department. Now, well, one more thing still alive, a lot of people have been asking me about if I'm going back to the analyst desk, and the truth of it is, I dunno, it's probably gonna depend a lot if, on two things - one if I'm gonna watch a crapload of competitive vods, mostly think of like, all of the LCS matches and LCK, since that's like, you actually have to watch to know the meta and make intelligent analysis even though I am pretty troll, I'll admit it. And the other thing of course if Riot invites me. Actually I did get invited to IEM but I did not go. Which, uh, I probably should've, I think it could've been a fun tournament to analyze.

But, anyways, in further news, there, yeah, Overwatch. So Overwatch is actually a game I'm really excited about for 2016, obviously it's still in beta, and it's not gonna be released for a while, but I think when it does get released it has a lot of potential as a competitive game, and maybe I could even one day compete in it, I'm not sure. It's gonna be very hard because right now I'm of course terrible, I didn't play shooters for 6 years, so my aim is like... yeah, my aim is terrible. But anyways, it's a game that I really do enjoy playing, I haven't enjoyed a game that much since League of Legends during my first years when I was still really into it, so, I'm gonna be streaming Overwatch as well, and making Overwatch videos, as well with the League videos.

And I'll just see how it balances out in the end, like am I gonna be making more League still, or am I gonna get really into Overwatch. The bad thing about Overwatch obviously, yeah as I said, it's still in beta, so there's not gonna be much viewerbase yet, but I hope some of you guys at least will buy the game when it does come out, or get the beta, it's a lot of fun, I do recommend it. The bad thing obviously being it's a Blizzard game, so they are gonna make you pay the, probably gonna make you pay like 60 euros and then expansions, perhaps. Which is a shame, because I think if Overwatch was a game like League of Legends, that it was free to play, it would have a lot more potential as a competitive game, because obviously there would be more people playing it, more viewerbase, and it's super fun. So, I do hope they make it free, but it's... it's not gonna happen. Isn't there like pre-buy already, so, yeah, it's definitely not gonna happen, which is a terrible thing.

And the third thing, yes, Spanish classes. So some of you might now, I'm living in Madrid, actually, right now, and I've been trying to learn Spanish individually, but it's... it's not that easy as it sounds, I mean it probably does sound hard as well, but it's really hard, especially the speaking part because I don't have anyone really to speak with or practice, more like, I feel really awkward talking to anyone in Spanish because I'm so bad at like, go full tilt mode, trying to think about the words that I want to say, maybe if you guys remember learning English or whatever language you have to learn, you know what I mean, but now it's gonna be four hours every day that I'm with people that are terrible as well at Spanish, so I'm not gonna feel so bad about speaking it, which is nice. I hope I learn fast, and then at least from this year I know how to speak Spanish, which is a productive thing, hooray.

Uh, I don't think, mmmm, yeah. So I think that pretty much covers my vlog, so I'm gonna be trying to make one every week, and hope you guys tune in to my stream, or whatever, and everyone have a, have a great day.

"Since you took so much time to make it, I'll be honest in my critique.

I'll open by saying it's not a bad video, and I did enjoy it. But you gotta chill with the jump cuts all over the place, especially when you are doing a more extended clip over a single fight. It makes it a lot harder to tell what is going on and it's why that style is a montage-parody staple. There is a lot of overkill on the editing, it tarnishes the value of what plays you were making.

I get that you were trying to sync with the music, but it just makes it harder to enjoy the plays. I guess this is also just a personal thing but I didn't like the music choice at all, if you are going for something where syncing up is a big part of your editing I'd go with a song choice with a much stronger rhythm. I also don't think that kind of music is suited to Lux's theme as a character, though again it's probably more of my personal bias coming out. Not a fan of that kind of Sum-41/Zebrahead kind of rock really.

I'd also like to add that there are a *lot* of wombos in this video. Like, a *lot* of them. I main Lux too so I know that's her thing, so you'll have a lot of footage of it, but she's capable of a lot more too. Max range snipes, Q's through the creep line, teamwide E/R wombos, perfectly timed shields, etc. are extremely sexy to watch for example. I know you had some of those in there but they were just kinda thrown in there amidst a sea of wombos, so they didn't stand out as their own plays very much imo. In fact, I'd say there was a much larger focus on the wombos since a lot of the longer clips were just a standard kill that got edited to the extreme.

Like I said though, it's not a bad video and I look forward to seeing what you make in the future. Lux is the shit.",129

"i know this is meant to be funny but still

kha zix was able to do this in s3

they removed it because his w applied his passive back then and everyone was maxing/evolving it (it also had less cd, more base dmg)

this playstyle was completely removed (lane kha with tear rush etc. and just waveclear everything , farm camps) and never came up again

and yes i know its completely stupid to compare it to rengar",188
"Oh, it was so much more than just a weapon that one shot people. The nova can do that too but it's not so bad. R8 had a LOT of problems.

For starters, it had insane accuracy and damage at long range, making it almost comparable to an AWP (the most popular sniper rifle in the game). You could one shot people from halfway across the map with a decently placed shot.

Furthermore, the R8 is very cheap. For context, you earn money in CSGO the same way you earn gold in League - killing enemies and completing objectives. You keep any weapons you buy until you drop them or die, at which point other players (allies and enemies) can pick up the dropped weapons. This makes buying expensive guns like the aforementioned AWP, which costs $4750, sort of risky because if you die and the enemy takes your weapon then you just handed them a huge stack of free cash. The R8 doesn't have this problem since it is only $850, you can buy a new one every single round and you probably won't even drop it on death if you have a primary weapon since you only drop your most expensive gun.

The R8 also has (had?) virtually no penalty to accuracy while moving/jumping. This is VERY unusual in CSGO, most weapons penalize you for moving around to emphasize skillful attacks over jumping a corner and blinding spraying all over the place. The R8 didn't have that, you could jump around to your heart's content knowing that you would land a killing blow the moment your crosshair was over the target.

And last but not least, the R8 has (had?) *insane* penetrating power. Bullets in CSGO do not automatically stop at the first thing they hit - they can penetrate through terrain depending on the type and thickness of terrain you want to shoot through. For example, if someone is hiding behind a door you can just shoot at the door and damage them on the other side (depending on what gun you use). The penetrating power also applies to players - if two players are lined up you can hypothetically kill both of them with one shot. Well, the R8 was capable of killing *three people* in one shot like this. You would sometimes get lucky and your $850 throwaway pistol would just win you the round on the spot.

Yeah, pre-nerf R8 was just bullshit. The game was unplayable for the few days it was around until Valve finally emergency nerfed it.",297

&gt;Last year, we investigated why players didn’t play ranked, and a huge number said they didn’t want to abandon their friends to do it.


Yeah well, boo fucking hoo. I have zero friends at the same skill level to duo with (I'm low plat, all my actual friends are either mid diamond or low gold), and I very much enjoy solo queue. Do you know what I do when I want to play with them? I go to normals. Or goof around in some 5v5 ranked team if they wish to do so.

&gt;""“Art requires a certain…cruelty.” 

&gt;Jhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder is art. Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed by shadowy elements within Ionia’s ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the best choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror. 

&gt;For years, Ionia’s southern mountains were plagued by the infamous “Golden Demon.” Throughout the province of Zhyun, a monster slaughtered scores of travelers and sometimes whole farmsteads, leaving behind twisted displays of corpses. 

&gt;In desperation, the Council of Zhyun sent an envoy to beg Great Master Kusho for help. Upon hearing of the region’s plight, Kusho feigned an excuse for why he couldn’t help. But a week later, the master, his son Shen, and star apprentice Zed, disguised themselves as merchants and moved to the province. In secret, they visited the countless families emotionally shattered by the killings, dissected the horrific crime scenes, and looked for possible connections or patterns to the murders. 

&gt;Their investigation took four long years, and left the three men changed. The famous red mane of Kusho turned white; Shen, known for his wit and humor, became somber; and Zed, the brightest star of Kusho’s temple, began to struggle with his studies. Upon finally finding a pattern to the killings, the Great Master is quoted as saying: “Good and evil are not truths. They are born from men and each sees the shades differently.” 

&gt;Depicted in a variety of plays and epic poems, the capture of the “Golden Demon” would be the seventh and final great feat in the illustrious career of Lord Kusho. On the eve of the Blossom Festival in Jyom Pass, Kusho disguised himself as a renowned calligrapher to blend in with the other guest artists. Then he waited. Everyone had assumed only an evil spirit could commit these horrifying crimes, but Kusho had realized the killer was an ordinary man. The famed “Golden Demon” was actually a mere stagehand in Zhyun’s traveling theaters and opera houses working under the name Khada Jhin. 

&gt;When they caught Jhin, young Zed marched forward to kill the cowering man, but Kusho held him back. Despite the horrors of Jhin’s actions, the legendary master decided the killer should be taken alive and left at Tuula Prison. Shen disagreed, but accepted the emotionless logic of his father’s judgment. Zed, disturbed and haunted by the murder scenes he had witnessed, was unable to understand or accept this mercy, and it is said a resentment began to bloom in his heart. 

&gt;Though imprisoned in Tuula for many years, the polite and shy Khada Jhin revealed little of himself - even his real name remained a mystery. But while a prisoner, the monks noted he was a bright student who excelled in many subjects, including smithing, poetry, and dance. Regardless, the guards and monks could find nothing to cure him of his morbid fascinations. 

&gt;Outside the prison, Ionia fell into turmoil as the Noxian empire’s invasion led to political instability. War awoke the tranquil nation’s appetite for bloodshed. The peace and balance Kusho had famously fought to protect was shattered from within as dark hearts rose in power and secret alliances competed for influence. Desperate to counter the power of the ninja and Wuju swordsmen, a cabal within the ruling council conspired to secretly free Jhin and turn him into a weapon of terror. 

&gt;Now with access to the Kashuri armories’ new weapons, and nearly unlimited funds, the scale of Khada Jhin’s “performances” has grown. His work has brought fear to many foreign dignitaries and to Ionia’s secret political underground, but how long will a serial killer, craving attention, be satisfied working in the shadows?""",256

"SINCE THIS IS THE TOP POST I'LL REPLY HERE

OP IS A TROLL:

OP are you a bundle of sticks? I went digging into your comment history and according to yourself 5 months ago you actually drunkenly cheated on your GF with your friends GF. You deleted the comment in the thread but it's still in your post history for some reason.

""[–]Hersheyx 2 points 5 months ago* not my story but my best friends, but i was heavily involved so here i go

all 3 of us went to middle school together and even graduated from the same high school, ive always known he liked her but he never did anything about it, so me being the good friend always pushed them together, i would plan events/ random midnight waffle house adventures just so they can get to know each other better, this lasted for years, i think it was when it was about junior year when she got interested in him, i have no idea why she waited this long but i was just happy they started going out, and everyday they would come to school together always laughing/ smiling and i would just feel all fuzzy inside and happy.

Fast forward graduation, we graduated and i went to a different college than them, but they were always smart kids so they managed to go to the same college, a local one, we barely kept contact because it was just hard, so eventually we drifted apart.

Fast foward again to about a year, THIS year, where we planned to all meet each other and just hang out because it was college break, this is where the fucked up shit happens, they were completely different, i barely recognized the guy his personality took a complete turn, she looked like a fucking mess, but i just thought they were stressed so we just went ahead to a random Saturday party, i had fun, he seemed to be having fun, and she was too, but the odd thing was they were not even talking to each other, i didnt want to ask so i just ignored it, she spent the majority of the party just being around me, i didnt mind it we were both drunk one thing lead to another and we somehow ended up sleeping together, and she then confessed that shes not happy and that she always liked me and that she only went out with him to see how defensive or protective i would get, this was a fucking shock to me, i was waiting for someone to come in and ""hahah its a prank!"" but sadly its was literally happening, she went on and on and all i could think about was how i fucked up and i need to tell him asap that i fucked up and slept with his girl, which i did and he said he was glad that i told him (i didnt tell him about how she faked being with him for years) but he told me that i was also a disgusting human being, they broke up and she somehow had the idea that were going to be together, and i told her even though shes my dear friend, im not interested and we should put this behind us.""

So basically you're mad that she left you for somebody else when you cheated on her and fucked someone else.

Also I had some sympathy for you, but you're a homophobic asshole. I know a lot of gay people in my life who are really cool and it wouldn't change depending on their sexual preference but you will always be a giant douche.

I mean what the fuck is this shit?

    [–]Hersheyx 6 points 1 month ago basically people are quick to forgive the bullshit gays do because theyre gay. if a straight guy did the same, he would probably get in trouble.

    [–]Hersheyx -20 points 1 month ago i hope hes not gay

    [–]Hersheyx -2 points 1 month ago yea, i dont want someone i like being..............them

-In the lobby you can neither see the level nor the rank of your premades, a small but annoying thing. You used to be able to see both of these things.

"Hi, i'm not a Rioter, but i am a systems engineer, so I could give you my guess.
The way it happened, it seems like as the load and number of players increased so did their system began to fail. 
That would leave me to believe that one specific backend system began overflowing. So think about that as either a weak link in a chain or a bottleneck. 

My guess would be on the matchmaking system. Until now, it's job was fairly simple. In ranked, only solos and duos, no roles, very easy for a system to handle cause every single task was uncomplicated.

Now, the new champ select bring 2 additional permutations. 

A. You have a total of 20 role assignments(so (Primary,Secondary)!=(Secondary,Primary)) Note: each role has different popularity.

B. 7 ways to make a group of 5(5 solos,1 duo+solos,2 duos+1,3+duo,3+2solos,4+1,5)

In addition, you have the MMR segmentations in place.

Overall, as players began to flood the system it couldn't handle all this in real time, fell behind and probably crash.

Fnatic wins, and/or Huni/RO significantly outperform their NA teammates, and you'll get more EU &gt; NA spam.

Working on his positioning would help him live up to that role even better.""

"To their defense, the mistake wasn't necessarily trying to do baron. The mistake was failing their engage.

Fnatic had a comp which (lategame) was all about strong engage and fighting 5v5. Febi baited out a cocoon and Black Shield with his E, and Gamsu TP's in to try to force something. When you have Gnar ult, Liss ult+spooky ghosts and a Kalista-boosted Alistar you expect to get that engage. However, they fumbled a lot and H2K got away without Odo even having to use TP.

So now they're in a situation where they can't back since H2K would just take baron and they can't dance it since H2K would just stall it out while Odo gets a free inhib. Their only choice that didn't end in distaster was to try to force a 5v5 by starting baron.

They lost that fight and bad things ensued, sure. However, it's not like there was a right choice at that point. The point they have to improve above all is coordinating their TP engages.",147

A couple points of feedback after a quick glance:

1. The ""level up your abilities"" box is a neat solve in exploration, but having it below the large + buttons that looks like League's ability level up made it confusing to find where it was directing me at first. I noticed the arrow on the left side of the box way too late. I would suggest moving the box, highlighting the arrow, or add a glowing state to the ""current level"" button.

2. I noticed you used Data Dragon (the ddragon.leagueoflegends.com source of data). The 'patch' versions (last digit) in Data Dragon are fixes to Data Dragon and rarely include substantial content differences (again, aside from fixes). I would recommend not showing the patch version and instead just use latest for that major.minor the user selected.

"Hijacking top comment for this PSA:

Last year my friend Miko committed suicide. He was an avid gamer. My friends and I miss him. [Make sure you are aware of the warning signs of suicide so that we can take better care of each other.](http://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/suicide-prevention-helping-someone-who-is-suicidal.htm) 

**Warning signs that might be relevant among LoL friends:** 

* **""Here, have my tickets to worlds. You're a good person and I want you to have them.** Often, people will give away valued possessions before they attempt suicide.
* **""I won't be around for much longer""** Statements like these can be warning signs.
* **""Hey, have a good life - won't be playing with you again""** Someone that is saying goodbyes and isn't going through a major, explained life change could be suicidal.
* Someone that is **always** playing league that hasn't shown up for a couple weeks in a row without reason could be going through a severe depressive episode. 
* **Sudden change in mood.** Often a sudden change of mood indicates that the sufferer has either entered a depressive episode or (if a dramatically positive change), could mean that they have come up with a plan to commit suicide. 

*****

**Remember QPR -**

*Question:*
If you see warning signs of suicidal ideation, be up front and ask the person if they have had any thoughts or plans of/for committing suicide. Note: **the wrong way** to ask this question is ""You haven't been thinking about killing yourself, have you?"" This is bad because it makes their thoughts seem secondary to your feelings. Instead, ask: ""Hey, you've been going through some crap - have you been feeling out of sorts?"" follow this up (if yes) with ""Have you had any thoughts about killing yourself?"" 

*Persuade:*
Persuade the person to seek medical help. Listen to them, offer them hope (such as you can), and let them know that you want to help them. Note that in this situation the ""right"" thing to say is often difficult for someone without training to know. Trying to offer hope and help (through a mental health professional) is usually the right thing to do. **Your only goal here is to get them to accept professional help.** Also note that while you may have had experiences with mental illness, everyone experiences it differently and stating that ""I know what you're going through"" can be a profoundly alienating statement for some people. For others it's nbd. Err on the side of avoiding the statement ""I know what you're going through"" or other statements along those lines. Calling a suicide hotline can also help.

*Refer:*
Refer the individual to the relevant crisis centers or professionals in your area. Could include clinics, police, ministers, teachers/professors, coaches, or counselors. Often suicide hotlines/emergency call lines (911 in the USA) can be an excellent resource for someone in need of immediate help.

*****

A few myths:

**Myth:** Suicides can't be prevented.

* **Fact:** Over 60% of people that attempt suicide directly intimate their intent to a friend before their attempt. When people are referred to get help, outcomes are typically positive. 

**Myth:** Talking to someone about suicide is likely to ""push them over the edge"".

* **Fact:** Studies show that this doesn't happen, and talking to someone about suicide isn't going to cause ""inception"" and push that idea into their head.

**Myth:** People that talk about suicide are just joking.

* **Fact:** Don't ignore statements like these. You don't know if they are joking or not. This is especially true for statements that indicate hopelessness ""I can't see any way out"" being an example.

**Myth:** Suicidal people are all crazies.

* **Fact:** Mental distress doesn't mean a person is crazy. [Lifetime rates of mental illness are around 50%.](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/09/03/cdc-statistics-mental-illness-in-the-us/)

*****

**Remember:** Suicidal people have lost hope. Few people truly want to die. To people that are considering suicide, death is their only escape. The most important thing is to offer hope.

Not every suicide is preventable, and we should try to remember this during tragedies like these. Miko (my friend) certainly didn't show any of these signs to me. Still, many suicides are preventable, and we should do our best to take care of each other and keep this community strong.

If you would like to donate to an organization that helps prevent suicides, the [National Suicide Prevention Lifeline](http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetInvolved/Donate) is an excellent organization. If you would like proper training with the QPR method the QPR Institute has trainings at many public health and higher education offices throughout the USA.",2984

"The point, IMO, of the changes to CDR was to force players to choose between CDR and other stats.

You can now take Morello + Athene's, but that overspends on mana unless you are extremely mana-hungry.

Or you can take Morello/Athene's + Nashor's, but that only works for a small number of champs.

Or you can take Morello/Athene's + Lich Bane for 30%, then get 10% from runes (giving up AP or MR) or boots (giving up Mpen).

Or you can take Morello/Athene's + 10% from runes (giving up AP or MR) + 10% from boots (giving up Mpen).

Or you can take Morello/Athene's + 20% from runes (giving up AP and possibly MR).

So each time this happens I have to leave the game. If I dont close the client and relog, the game simply wont reconnect and I get black screen. Every time. 

I've written tickets, posted countless times on reddit, spoken to a riot help desk employee, bought a new computer since it started happening and reinstalled many times on both machines. Nothing works, and no one knows why. 

People will tell you it's something to do with an antivirus or firewall permissions. People will tell you it doesnt happen to them and it never has. But at the end of the day it's been happening to me for years now and I've never found a fix, and it's never temporarily gone away. ",146
"Seriously the system in Dota 2 is soooo much better.

You can only queue ranked as 1 - 2 - 3 or 5 players

if you queue solo the teams can only consist of solo and duo players

if you queue duo you might get with other solo or duo players but also you can play with a trio.

And a trio can only meet a duo

furthermore 5 players can only meet another full team

So you have a Solo MMR for going into a que alone
and a party MMR for queueing up with any party size

What we need an answer to is what happens if Player B from your example ends up playing a game by himself. Does he still get matched against Player A?

"So to give a rundown of the situation; paiN, CNB, Keyd, KaBuM and G3x are threatening to boycott CBLOL due to the alleged relationship between INTZ and Red Canids (Ex-INTZ RED, their sister team)

**Copying my last comment on the matter for context [from a previous article](http://omelete.uol.com.br/esports/artigo/relacao-entre-intz-e-red-canids-poe-em-xeque-novo-regulamento-do-cblol/):**

---

Up until last split, sister teams were still allowed in Brazil

With sister teams no longer being allowed, INTZ couldn't keep INTZ Red, their sister team.

They reported a month ago that the team had been sold to a new group of investors.

---

In the report that is linked above, it finally came to light who the Red Canids (ex INTZ Red) owners are. They're both related to the two INTZ Owners.

*Rogério Rodrigues de Almeida* and *Lucas Simões de Almeida*

* Dinara Guzairova is Lucas' Girlfriend

* Luan Rodrigo Florencio de Almeida is Rogério's Son.

Now the problem here is that CBLOL changed its' rules to be the same as the ones we have in the LCS:

&gt; No Team Owner or Team Manager or Affiliate of an Owner may own or control, directly or indirectly, or have a direct (e.g.,ownership) or indirect (e.g., a contractual arrangement) financial interest, or be an employee or contractor of, more than one League of Legends team in a professional eSports league.

Besides the relationship between owners stated above, Luan is also a substitute player for INTZ, while being RED's owner.

It's worth mentioning that the teams live in front of each other (different apartments) but share a kitchen/balcony (I used to live there when I worked for them).

RED's new Manager is also INTZ's former Marketing Manager

---

Finally, in an email about team icons, the guy at Riot forgot to hide the list of emails and in it were only emails of owners of 7 different teams, meaning no one from RED's ownership is listed in the emails.

This led G3x's owner to believe that the two teams share the same management.",344

13 wins in a row with Heimer+Malza pushing power.


I really hope ad Malzahar's unique playstyle stays, and he doesn't become just another mage with only 1 proper playstyle.

Imo it's great to have these champions with 2 or more totally different, but still viable playstyles to add some flavour in the game.

Getting to master tier with this playstyle is huge, and definitely shows it's very viable.

"To be honest I think it's amazing that league managed to almost match Clash of Clans' revenue. Microtransactions in that game give you an edge over other players, and it is the top grossing app. Theres a lot more incentive for clash of clans players to purchase in game items than there is for League. League on the other hand has microtransactions that give you absolutely no advantage over other players. I think it shows how good league really is, if so many people are willing to support the game through purely cosmetic purchases. 

Edit:  thought league made 1.62 and clash of clans made 1.64, my bad. It's still great that league made more than the top grossing app while having content that gives very little advantage to players that pay",120
"FWIW one of the goals with the old Rengar update was to make him have a longer tail but less burst in his combat with changes like removing AD/Pen from Bonetooth Necklace, giving him Ferocity buildup after his ultimate but not during, and making E a skillshot so his engages are less reliable.

Still, doesn't seem to add up, even with minions it'd be hard to deal 400 damage in a single instance.

Alistar's ult. Most people see it solely as a defensive stat steroid. It actually also gives him 90 AD. Most people don't know this, and the people that do, don't really care because it isn't a visible effect. On the other hand, if, during Alistar's ult, he had, let's just say a three hit passive that would do the same amount of damage as if he'd hit you three times with that 90 AD, you're a lot more likely to know he's doing more damage instead of just ""oh I'll just beat the shit out of him."" Pretty much, those three hit passives are a very effective way of visualizing in game effects.

Its destacable that all the others competitors have an open, where anyone whit his team can participate if wants to, also it's free. 

So Riot appointed an existing competition called ""division de honor"" led by LVP to be this bridge in Spain 

The point is, the LVP with this new powers not only  is not going to do an open, but suddenly and arbitrarily eliminated teams that went to compete and set others. All this ""under the table""

"I really find it amusing when I see posts like this one... because this is as counter-productive as it gets. Now, I'm gonna make a few assumptions on what your post looks like since I cannot know your specific case, but I'll basically simply highlight what quite a few people do :

1. **Post a lot of times the same stuff**. Saying something once is fine. Saying something twice makes it more visible. Spamming it makes is a circlejerk/knee-jerk reaction. The more you post about a single topic, the easier it is to discard your posts as biased and close-minded.

2. **You knew it, called it, and it went exactly as you said**. This is another thing that points toward bias and close-mindedness. Basically, it makes it look like your only goal is to have them confirm your original opinion. You're not looking for a middle ground nor a discussion, you're looking to wave you e-peen and look better than them.

3. **Completely avoiding the good aspects of the system**. This refers to the last point. Your goal in feedback should be to highlight what you like, dislike, and what you're uncertain about or are afraid of in the near/far future. If you intentionally omit the good points, and the ones you're unsure about, it doesn't make it look like you are open to discussion nor does it displays you being honest/as objective as possible.

I mean... nobody in their sane mind can think that Dynamic Queue is 100% bad and nothing good can be salvaged from it... So might as well take a cup of tea and try to discuss with them to understand what they like about it and why you don't think it works with their current iteration.",151

&gt;""[–]Hersheyx 2 points 5 months ago* 
not my story but my best friends, but i was heavily involved so here i go

&gt;all 3 of us went to middle school together and even graduated from the same high school, ive always known he liked her but he never did anything about it, so me being the good friend always pushed them together, i would plan events/ random midnight waffle house adventures just so they can get to know each other better, this lasted for years, i think it was when it was about junior year when she got interested in him, i have no idea why she waited this long but i was just happy they started going out, and everyday they would come to school together always laughing/ smiling and i would just feel all fuzzy inside and happy.

&gt;Fast forward graduation, we graduated and i went to a different college than them, but they were always smart kids so they managed to go to the same college, a local one, we barely kept contact because it was just hard, so eventually we drifted apart.

&gt;Fast foward again to about a year, THIS year, where we planned to all meet each other and just hang out because it was college break, this is where the fucked up shit happens, they were completely different, i barely recognized the guy his personality took a complete turn, she looked like a fucking mess, but i just thought they were stressed so we just went ahead to a random Saturday party, i had fun, he seemed to be having fun, and she was too, but the odd thing was they were not even talking to each other, i didnt want to ask so i just ignored it, she spent the majority of the party just being around me, i didnt mind it we were both drunk one thing lead to another and we somehow ended up sleeping together, and she then confessed that shes not happy and that she always liked me and that she only went out with him to see how defensive or protective i would get, this was a fucking shock to me, i was waiting for someone to come in and ""hahah its a prank!"" but sadly its was literally happening, she went on and on and all i could think about was how i fucked up and i need to tell him asap that i fucked up and slept with his girl, which i did and he said he was glad that i told him (i didnt tell him about how she faked being with him for years) but he told me that i was also a disgusting human being, they broke up and she somehow had the idea that were going to be together, and i told her even though shes my dear friend, im not interested and we should put this behind us.""

So basically you're mad that she left you for somebody else when you cheated on her and fucked someone else. 

Also I had some sympathy for you, but you're a homophobic asshole. I know a lot of gay people in my life who are really cool and it wouldn't change depending on their sexual preference but you will always be a giant douche. 

I mean what the fuck is this shit? No wonder she left your dumb ass.

This theory, or one like orianna's father who might try to rectify his mistake or something like that (similar to how renekton is in the league basically to kill Nasus), are tear jerki- eeerr... attract onion cutting ninja's. They are really cool, and that's how interesting worlds are made. Theorizing and thinking about lore, trying to find missing pieces or just reading ""the story"" are what make cool video game worlds (see dark souls and warcraft respectively). However, it feels like Riot actively tries to avoid it. I mean, theories dark souls lore worthy are found and discussed even before the champion is officially announced!

Just like with ekko's trailer: ""wow, that must be Sion/Urgot before his reconstruction. So was it Ekko who killed him? and so forth, and many more. Then Riot says: ""Nah, he's just a random Zaun goon.""

Why? Why deny opportunities of lore like that? You don't have to explicitly state that it IS one of them, but they straight up avoid any possibility of cool interconnections.

**Solo-queue** - Queue up individually to face other soloists on the field of battle.  
**Dynamic queue** - Queue up solo or with a group up to 5 people to enjoy battle in a team centric atmosphere.  

This gives all of us who want a true solo-queue experience just that.  For those who prefer to play on a premade with friends, and for those soloists who *want* to get on a premade team as a filler, they have that option too.  Simple.  Done.

Reason: Minions hit Lee Sin at the same time as Wolf =&gt; Wolf is coded as friendly minion and therefore friendly minions can proc kindreds E also.

Listen, the main goal here isn't to get an appeal. My main goal is to open up discussion about bringing back a new and improved tribunal system.

How do I get a URL for a reform card? Sorry, if someone could let me know. The email has very minimal information about any appeal process and there isn't a link with my script in it so I just used puush to take screenshots.

*2nd Edit*: He asked for all of my ban cards so I don't think I'll be getting that appeal and maybe a public lynching to go with it. I said I was bad in previous bans but because of it my reports would lead to bans without reading the script and I was just hoping to bring attention to that issue and get a new and improved tribunal.

You can already do this in live but just at the cost of extra .5s but at 45% cdr in the live game you'll be slowing them for 1s more and will do more dmg per snowball.

"OMFG I've never seen this!!! SO HOT 

EDIT: Okay this video blew up (as it should) and I really want to expand on my comment. I woke up, read it again, and feel it doesn't do justice to this play.

I've played a LOT of Bard. I have the most Bard games at Riot. I have seen people one shot squishies with Luden's Echo + RFC + meeps + thunderlords, I've watched all the highlight videos of the impossible 2 minute chases and escapes with Bard, I've seen the reverse Fiddlesticks Zhonya's + Tempered Fate bait, I've seen Shrine-over-Caitlyn-trap plays, and I've seen entire enemy teams get baited or tricked into taking Magical Journeys. I have a Bard mask on my chalk bag for rock climbing. I have seen some Bard.

But I have never seen anything like this. This is the most incredible and, dare I say, **magical** play I've ever seen on a Champion whose identity is all about these weird interactions and strange fuck-the-enemy-team or fuck-your-own-team moments.    ",1141

"“Cancelling a project unlikely to deliver expected benefits should not be seen as a failure — failing to cancel such a project should be.”

edit:

A bit of a flippant quote for sure.  We don't know what the project goals were.  What is Riot trying to deliver to the players on this change?  Can the new queue deliver the goals Riot set forth to produce for the players?  What are player expectations for a ladder ranking?

The player base has expectations of grinding a solo queue they have always known.  It was our way of being able to see how solo/duo players/teams could fare against the rest of the community.  What we had is now seemingly being transformed into a new dynamic queue.  No longer are we always going to be judged in a 1 or 2 player queue.  Players are voicing their opinions as to why they disagree with the new dynamic queue.  Will it be good?  Quite possibly.  Will it be bad?  Again, quite possibly.  Will it be different and judge players in a different manner than the old solo queue?  Most certainly.

TL;DR
-Riot changes how players are ranked
-Vocal players don't like that solo/duo queue was eliminated and don't believe dynamic queue offers the same ranking characterization
-Tears and questions for Riot, hopefully pointed responses",696

NRG is being way overhyped here, I think we should be assessing them + Immortals and Echo Fox on the same level: new teams with a mix of proven talent and challenger talent. They should be placed mid-table until we see them in action; there simply isn't enough data to judge otherwise.

"I admire Riot's dedication to providing opportunities for friends to play with friends without restriction, but I don't think eliminating SoloQ entirely is the right way to do that. 

Dynamic Q should exist as a Q for 2 or more friends to take on ranked together, and Solo players should have the option of doing it. However, pure SOLO Q should still exist - where every player is truly solo. I joined league because my friends played, and now they've all moved on. I'm the only one who still plays regularly, and even when my friends come back for the odd game night every few months I'm too far ahead in ranked to actually play with them. 

I feel like I'm being punished for not having friends who play league. I feel like riot is saying, ""Sorry your friends left, maybe you should follow them to a new game."" I know it's not that extreme, but this new ""design philosophy"" is making me feel that way. I don't want to play ranked anymore because I'm scared of being matched up against 2s, 3s, and 4s. I don't care if I statistically win the same amount against these teams, *it's not fun to play with or against them regardless of my win rate*. I don't like feeling like a 3rd/4th/5th wheel in the game, I don't like my enemies playing Duo Bot + Jungle and gangbanging my less organized botlane/midlane just because they're talking to each other and we aren't.

From Riots point of view it makes perfect sense to keep it. This is a choice that affects the bottom line for Riot. 

Let me tell you about something called **ARPU** - Average revenue per user.

In stark contrast with with what this reddit seems to believe, E-sport is not making the revenue for Riot. Casual players are and this change is gonna make casual players spend more money on the game.

League has an ARPU of $1.32 per 2014, source:

https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/mmo-arpu/

This is not good. It means that their customer base is not where they want it to be. They are out of the big free to play games the worst at getting money from their users.

Compare it to World of Tanks with: $4.51 this means every single WOT customer is worth about 3,5 times the value of your average league user. 

You don't have to be an CEO to see how Riot would like to get their ARPU further towards WOT levels then they are right now, even if this means losing out on some of their current users. 

Hardcore soloqueue people are not the driving force behind ARPU. Most of the hardcore Soloqueue players are young people in high school or college with limited financial means. What you want is to get the older customer base invested who have cash to throw around. It's not a coincidence that WOT who on average have an older customer base then DOTA or League is at the top of this list.

So while Dynamic queue sucks for people that want to compete at the highest level or that just want to improve in a competitive environment, it works like a charm to get a group of 27 year old friends with spare time and cash to invest their time and money into fucking around as a group of 3, 4 or 5 players. Financially stable and established people with spare cash and time lying around.

&gt; Can't they just play ranked 5's?

Well, yes they could. However the entry of play for ranked 5's are much higher. You need 5 players, this makes it unfriendly for people that may have responsibilities making it hard to schedule for playing every week. If you schedule a session for 5 players and someone suddenly have to leave it ruins the session. 

What group of players could have short notice responsibilities like this you ask. Newly established families of young parents for instance. People that have come into their first source of money where they are most likely no longer living month to month and have room to throw some cash around. 

Remember the ranked 5's all dad teams? 

They would love this feature, if someone has to take a game of to change diapers or feed a baby, a person can just sit one out without interrupting the gaming session. The new queue offers great flexibility in order for playtime and level of entry for people that may not have the option of setting a side time for ranked 5's or the will to play alone. It's basically great for casual players on all levels besides high ELO. 

&gt; Yeah, but this is still ruining the game for me and I'm going to play Dota where they have a real solo queue, and then Riot will see that their customer base is dropping and revert the changes. 

They probably won't, like I said earlier in this post the ARPU in League is insanely low, in fact it's pretty much only sustainable because their playerbase is big enough that they can rely on the low ARPU. If they have seen trends in their customer base indicating that the their playerbase is changing they would try to compensate with increasing ARPU some other way, most likely by catering to casual players with disposable income over young players with limited incoming, witch most of the ELO players are. 

It won't always work out when they do this, but no company regardless of public outcry is gonna let revenue drop. They always try to correct what they can. Cable companies responded to cordcutters by increasing price for the remaining customers in order to avoid quarterly losses. 

I suspect Riot has seen a decrease in playerbase on the casual level and is responding to this by introducing Dynamic queue to cater to casual players playing with friends. 

I'm not saying what's the wrong choice here, I'm just saying why Riot might want to shake things up, and it has nothing to do with matchmaking, skill levels or sense of accomplishments. Riots is in the business of making money, this is how they best think they can make more money or at least avoid losing money.

You have to understand that ""It will make it harder to correctly estimate skill"" and ""We have a larger customer base"" are both poor defenses when trying to answer for the much lower ARPU then other F2P games in a boardroom. Players wishes always comes second, Riots is no different then other gaming companies in this regard. 

Especially since Riot unlike other gaming companies can't defend loss of revenue by saying it is increasing revenue other places. Valve can afford lower revenue on own brand games since they can show that it's overall good for steam the real moneymaking machine, Blizzard can defend certain losses by pointing to a increased user base on Battlenet. Riot has no fallback solution, they have no Brand or plattform to fall back on. 

**TL:DR If you feel like the new queue is fucking you over, it probably is, but your ARPU is on average lover then the people that loves this queue so Riot's gonna keep it anyway. Riot does not care about your feelings, sense of accomplishment or skills. They care about your wallet.**

**EDIT:** If anyone wants a fast intro to monetization in F2P games you can watch [this](https://youtu.be/c7H40Qd_lis) it's about WOT, but still gives great insight into how a gaming company will be thinking about these things. 

**EDIT2:** There is also a lot of info in the free reports you can find [here](http://www.eedar.com/reports-0) - Fair warning, you will have to give them your info in order to receive the PDF's by email if you want them. They have a lot of info about thing related to choices a gaming company makes and how to understand they make their choices. ",198

"I didn't ever think I would get to comment on this topic because it happened so long ago, but the gods have smiled upon me, and have given me the chance to voice my opinion on this important matter.

I feel sorry for the dude. I mean, all embarrassment aside, a few years ago was a rough time for lewd League of Legends images. Like, it was like the porno Dark Ages. Cultural advancement was greatly limited as the League of Legends community was much smaller, and therefore the number of fan artists was fewer, with the number of adult fan artists even fewer. Like, the Tristana picture he was looking at, you can really look at it and marvel at how far we've come. It's like, not high quality, but I guess it gets the job done, you know? It's like looking at a Model T, or a old Nokia. It gives you a feeling of nostalgia, but it's not something you would want to use today.

We're in a great age, if you're into adult League of Legends art. I mean, you've got Sakimichan getting paid like 50k a month to draw Ahri's tatties. I'm pretty sure adult League artists might be making even more money then Riot itself. Won't be long before we see official nude mods released next to chroma packs. I'm sure that will lead to some uproar in the community, too. ""First, you charge us for recolorings, and now you charge us to take clothes off? wtf rito"". It's in all languages too. English, Chinese and Korean being the main ones I've seen. The rivalries between regions may always be strong, but stronger is our unification under the enjoyment of seeing Nidalee/Rengar go at it, or, bizzarely but omnipresently, Zac/Riven images.

Hell, back then, you were probably lucky to get a lewd image of your GF from the rift that wasn't some crazy fetish, like, Ashe flying into the air on a gyrocopter naked while she duels Corki in a dogfight or something. The Tristana picture was pretty vanilla, so I guess that was a lucky one. Now, you've got plenty of content, not just of every champion, but even all of their skins. Firefighter? Dragon tamer? Riot girl? No problem. Even new skins, people will draw and post their skin spotlights before SkinSpotlights even releases their video. Anivia, thousand year old bird made of solid ice? I've seen it. Hell, if you've ever wanted to see naked female Yorick, I'm sure that exists too, having her posing next to some surprisingly curvaceous ghouls. We'll probably see a digitally painted image of Ahri getting freaky in the Museum of Modern Art in a couple of years, right next to a million-dollar Pollock. And you know what? I would support that. Hell, I might even visit it myself to catch a gander, all the time thinking of all those out there who are celebrating, rejoicing, in our own private Hentai Renaissance.",463

"Not a bad idea to have a heal over time as a summoner, but do note that Barrier and Heal are already distinct:

Barrier shields 1 target for a duration of time. That shield can absorb more damage than a Heal heals one target for.

Heal heals one target, a second nearby allied champion, and increases movement speed for both. This is why you rarely see bot lane take barrier but often see mid lane do – lane partners benefit from the additional heal and movement speed effects.

So clearly, the two are distinct. The current version of Heal is, in my opinion, a more interesting combat dynamic than a heal over time like Mundo's ult. It adds an element of surprise and effects two (four, really, if you consider both champions) variables: movement speed and health (as opposed to just health). It requires more thought on the part of the user to use it effectively than a heal over time you pop before a fight that looks like it'll last a while.",165

"Last 6 games: 7/12, 3/8, 2/8, 1/3, 6/9, 5/10. kda avg 7.6/8.3/6.4 Not really sure how he climbed, he was d5 with plat mmr for 99% of the season. Probably cuz preseason.

Also look at the left side of his op.gg. Except for bard and graves all the other champs he played had a higher winrate than his shaco. He still plays shaco mostly but he has plenty of wins on other champs. and overall it seems like he plays much better on other champs.

The only reason I'm hating is because I hated having people like him on my team. they always ruin the game by forcing their playstyle on you. Whenever their playstyle doesn't work they always keep playing the same way so you get scores like the ones listed above ( and almost 8.5 avg deaths per game). That means you are pretty much playing 4v5 because they aren't tanky enough to be useful while also doing no damage. There was another teemo only player that did the same thing around d2 a couple months ago, and every game I had him fucking sucked. He split pushed while building half ad half ap and ended up doing nothing but dying. Yah once every 3 games he does well and gets and early inhib, just like Pink ward sometimes does well, but these games are really rare. The worst part is these guys play 50 games a day so it felt like they are in my game whenever I played.

And again I'm not saying he's not good at shaco or the teemo guy isn't good at splitting. I'm saying they have no fucking idea what to do when they fall behind and keep doing the same shit over and over because that's all they can do. and they fall behind often because their strats are easy to counter when you have decent players. I will bet anyone that he will not be d2 next season unless he changes his playstyle.

Edit: looks like I might be wrong about his elo, in the last few months he has steadily climbed. However, I believe around d2 (the elo he is at) people learn how to teamfight based on their strengths or weaknesses and something as easy to counter as pink wards playstyle won't hold up. Which is why I said he most likely will not climb higher.",194

"First and foremost, thank you for participating in this conversation. I don't want to give the impression that I want to argue with a Rioter, because I really don't. I appreciate that you're taking time to answer to concerns about your champion.

The Beauty in Death passive *(?)* is a nice touch, but it's still just a little gimmick in a kit that, in general, lacks in theme and coherence. I'm not saying the skills themselves aren't coherent together, just that they aren't doing anything to fortify the theme, the flavor or the personality of the champion. Instead, what we're getting is generic sniper in a thinly veiled coat of *""beauty maniac""* paint.

Virtuoso is a representation of masterful art. If you consider accuracy an art, literally every champion with a skillshot becomes a virtuoso, thereby making no one a virtuoso.

The virtuoso/making things beautiful theme was interesting. I feel like you could've explored more areas to truly engage in that trope: corpse sculptures; a saccade-like playstyle, reminiscent of a violin, ballet or butterfly wings; a more in-depth representation of a slow and graceful petal cascade; etc.

Then again, I'm not bashing you. I think the kit is interesting (although not in relation with the theme), and creating a champion is a team effort. I just think many people could've cooked up something vastly more interesting with such a fun theme - *including me (shameless plug, what's up)*.",107

He needs to see professionals and find one he strikes a chord with on a personal level. This isn't some type of malignancy you can surgically remove and it's gone. The reality is depression is unrelenting, and he needs people better than the chaos that is the Internet to help him sort out his personal issues. I'd hate to see him bury this as though everything is okay until one day it isn't.

"**Well I'm joined right now by Reignover, after their third match of the season. Reignover that was a lot closer than I thought it was going to be, TSM's supposed to be really weak right now, earlier you guys were saying oh yeah we're gonna win number 1, it's gonna be fine, Huni and Pobelter both said this, what happened in that game?**

**R:** Um, I think we made pretty much a lot of mistake at level 1, we did a blind swap, and then our duo should've stopped them doing their blue side camp, but they made to finish all three, so it was like, pretty bad early game as a jungler, and then we try to swap back and then we make a few mistake during, around our top and jungle sides, so the early game was super hard, and then they make some play around our bot, and then also we make bad decision there too, so our early game was pretty bad, I think it was on TSM, I think TSM could've win if they don't make mistake, but after that, we try to get ourself mentally solid, and then we just say wait until the enemy mistake, and then TSM finally make a mistake and I think that's why we win the game.

**So was this kind of a humbling experience for you guys, because last week, like I said, it felt like, talking especially to Huni afterwords, there was just so much confidence, like we're so much better, all the other, like a lot of other players on other teams are saying Immortals are so much better, but you guys looked a little bit weak there.**

**R:** Mmm, I think usually, when a team looks weaker, I think it's coming from the thing that you, have mindset that you have to not make mistake, so no one is making plays when you're behind, so I think the fact that we have to make no mistake and then try to come back when we're behind, I think that's the reason why the team pretty much look weak when you're behind, you know. So I think that's why.

**So now you've been here for just about two weeks, what are the differences between being in the EU LCS and the NA LCS?**

**R:** Ummm, playing at EU LCS and NA LCS? Mm, I think most difference is the time, I think I prefer playing early than at night, because sometimes at EU if you're fifth game and then the games are long then we are going home at like after 12 o'clock, you know, so here I just prefer way better, playing early. And I think I like doing fan meet outside of the stage, like outside here, I think it's pretty cool. And... I think other side of that it's pretty much same.

**Do you feel like there's any differences between the NA LCS culture, and attitude, and all the different players, like I've heard that EU LCS players go out more often and hang out with other teams, and there's kind of like little parties after LCS, and that doesn't really exist in NA LCS, do you feel there's any difference?**

**R:** Um, when I was at Fnatic, no one in our team were going out after LCS, like even though we do 2-0 or even though we do 18-0, everyone just come to the house and then we just chill ourselves, so actually I didn't even know that EU LCS players are like going out after LCS, you know, because I heard it here, so I don't really know. And even at NA, we're not really doing something else after LCS, so I think it's just pretty much the same for me.

**By the way, have you tried the boba, the boba truck over there?**

**R:** Of course, this one? Yeah, it's really good. I love it.

**They gave me it for free, I told them I'd bring it up in the interview, so now I've done that. It's really good. I think it's like a mother and son, I think, and the son knew who I was, and so I think he's an LCS fan, so that's why I got the boba for free. You should try to get free boba.**

**R:** Oh, ok lol

**It's a good deal, just plugging Phantom food truck, currently located outside of the NA LCS. What, what happens for you on Immortals, how does the team work, cuz we were talking a little bit about this beforehand, I asked you if you guys go out, cuz a lot of NA players just don't, like they go and their whole thing is like we stay at home, we go out for food, we go to LCS, we go back home, like they never go out and do anything. What is it like for the Immortals side of things?**

**R:** Um, basically our food at our gaming house is extremely great, so we don't really have to go out to get good food, so we go out to eat good food sometimes, but I think our team want us to be outside of the game, for one day in like one or two weeks, so there's like team day, team out day, I don't know how to say, we go do escape rooms, or just those kind of things, like we just, I think we're just gonna keep doing that.

**An escape room, for those that don't know what an escape room is, can you describe what an escape room is like?**

**R:** Mmmm, it's like, you go to, I don't know how to explain, you have to, you go in the room, and then you have to solve the things, solve the puzzles, and then you have to try to get out of that room in like one hour.

**So basically, at the escape room, they lock your whole team in, and then you guys all have to work together to figure out how to get out. How did it go, like how helpful was everyone, who was the best at helping to escape the room, who was useless?**

**R:** lolol, umm. The first stage, I think we cleared it as a team pretty well, pretty fast, and the second one was I think we couldn't make it at the last stage, because it was super random, I think, I think it was random. I think if it was harder we could finish it, but it was too easy, you know, so we couldn't think of it. But I think our coach Dylan was pretty good at it, he was talking a lot, and then everyone else was useless lol

**It was literally him carrying all you guys, everyone else was dead weight?**

**R:** Everyone was doing their job, but he was little bit more special, I guess.

**What did you guys do after LCS last week, because Huni was very excited about the idea that you guys were gonna go to a steakplace to celebrate going 2-0, what'd you guys end up doing?**

**R:** You mean last week? Um, I think I didn't join the steak party, but I heard that they had a really good steak -

**Why didn't you join the steak party?**

**R:** I don't really like steak, I just prefer -

**You don't like steak?**

**R:** I think so, lol

**Are you a vegetarian, you don't like meat?**

**R:** No I like meat, but I just don't prefer steak, yeah.

**So you just sat at home quietly by yourself while everybody else went to go get steak?**

**R:** I don't think it was everyone, I think it was like three of four, so.

**Alright, your manager, your CEO, I don't know what to call him, is shaking his head.**

**R:** Oh, last week, yeah, last week we went for sushi, I thought you were talking about the first, oh wait, I think Huni go to the steak, no, they went to the steak, at some point. But Huni went to the steak with the guys. Ah, ok. I guess it wasn't that one.

**So then you did go, that's very good. By the way, speaking of food, cuz this interview, you know, that's what I talk about, everything except for esports. You said the food is really good at the Immortals house, how is the food so good. Like a chef?**

**R:** Our manager, Dodo, I think he's really good cooker, and he's Korean, so he cooks a lot of Korean food, and then usually people don't hate Korean food, so Turtle and Adrian, like everyone of us is Asian, you know, so it's like they pretty much like all Dodo's food, so we have pretty much same taste, so I think we are having really good food.

**Well, I think that wraps it up, I've learned everything I need to about Immortals. Is there anything you want to say to any of the fans out there, Reignover?**

**R:** umm... always saying, but it's really, I'm super thankful that you guys are keep supporting us, and that like it's our first season, and I think we will really try to perform well. ...And - no, I think I

**No what was it?**

**R:** Aw

**Were you gonna give a shoutout to somebody or something?**

**R:** Uhhhh. Actually do it?

**I don't know what it is, but sure, do it.**

**R:** Fine, I'll do next time.

**No, but then, I want it, what if you do it in somebody else's interview, I'm very excited about it.**

**R:** Today morning I saw Febiven having some interview, you know

**You saw who?**

**R:** Febiven's interview, Febiven, you know. And then he said he compare me and Spirit, and then he said Spirit ganks way more than me, you know, better than me, I guess. I just want to say Pobelter die to way less gank than Febiven, so yeah, I just want to say, he was not intending that for offense, but maybe I get some offend, I was offended a bit, but it's a joke, but yeah.

**That's good, we'll just banter back and forth in the next EU LCS interview, somebody else can say something. Alright, thank you so much, that was really fun.

In the gauntlet, they proceed to reverse sweep the first two Bo5's against Gravity and Impulse, which were both favored over C9 by that point. They finally took a convincing 3-1 against Liquid for the seed to worlds.

You might know the rest, but at worlds Hai seemed to finally be in a comfortable spot again, as they won all three matches for the first week at worlds, putting them at the top of their group even over Fnatic.

However, requiring only a single game to advance out of group stages, they proceed to essentially get reverse-sweeped, losing 4 games in a row and being eliminated from worlds.

"This is the thing that amazes me most about Faker. *Even the people he plays against all widely agree that he is the singularly the best.* That is unbelievably rare in competitive games. There's usually at least some disagreement on who is the best at a game because players from other teams might view one of their own teammates more favorably than other team's players. I mean, I'm sure people on the Celtics thought Larry Bird was the best player, but players on the Lakers most likely thought Magic Johnson was the best. You play with a person and it biases you.

But in LoL, there's no one who disagrees about Faker. Even in such a competitive group of people as the Koreans, who quite literally *live* to play LoL with the sole purpose of winning and 'proving' themselves, there is no argument from anyone about Faker being \#1.

Just compare it to the Western scene. Pros in the West are forever asked the question in interviews, ""Who is the best Western player?"" and the answer has changed a lot of over time and different people at different times had different people at \#1. Rarely was there ever much agreement and, if there were, it didn't last long as someone else came and took people's perception of the top spot. But I dare say that ever since Faker came into pro play there has not been a single person who has answered something other than ""Faker"" to the question: ""Who is the best player in the world?""

"I don't know man man, I feel like this post is kinda missing the point. I don't think Rengar is MASSIVELY over powered and ""lacks counter-play"", but its unfair to almost entirely chalk it up to vision changes and ignore the champion itself. As easy as it is to discount the opinion that Rengar might be over tuned by saying they don't know how to play versus him, it simply isn't the case. Yes bronze, silver, gold, plat, diamond, masters players are **objectively bad**, but what about challenger players. It would be ridiculous to go further and say high challenger players are bad too. Rengar single handily changes the way nearly everybody has to play simply through existing in the game. That is a strength in itself even if the enemies do adapt to play around him perfectly. Not only that but I feel like you vastly over selling how much pink wards do to counter Rengar. Pink wards don't stop him from killing your carry. Pink wards don't give you some huge window to prepare for him to jump on your carry. Pink wards have relatively small ranges. You will almost always see the ! and him jumping at you without him ever being stealth inside your pink. Plenty of **objectively good** players have expressed feelings that Rengar is over powered at the very least in a solo queue setting. You clearly realize this so I don't see where the disconnect is between that and realizing he needs some changes. Over powered doesn't mean auto win, it doesn't mean no counter play, it just means he is more powerful than he should be. Riot could design a champion with an ability that one shots champions literally, just deals 100% max hp true damage and I could make a video saying that champion isn't over powered. You just need to play around the range of that ability. Poke him down or cc him from out of his range and kill him before he can cast it. Play around fog and bushes so you can 1 shot him before he can target you. You can buy banshees veil. I could tell you all you have to do is bring shield champions or buy locket because the 100% max hp doesn't take into account shields. Surely this example is hyperbolic but I feel like the point still stands. If you do make a video I guess I'm interested in what you have to say but I really do think you are over selling vision/trinket changes. This isn't the first time Rengar has been strong, hell I can hardly remember a time where Rengar was actually not good.",156

Fiora ult at level 3 with 40% cdr = 42 seconds

Not to mention she can just ult someone else. The problem is that Fiora is just too strong. 

She can kill you if you're a tank, she can 2 hit you if you're squishy, she can build tank after just 2 items and becomes hard to kill, she has huge movement speed boosts on low cooldown so its hard to catch her, her laning phase is safe, she has retarded scaling and she can counter any CC with a slow/atk speed slow and even a stun.

She is also strong in all phases of the game.  Even her lane ""counters"" are actually just skill matchups. Renekton, Lissandra, Pantheon, Riven... and not only she outscales them but can also kill them 1v1 while being 1-2 kills down.

If the Fiora player is even decent she will become a nightmare for the other team to deal with. The problem is that in lower elos its harder to find decent Fiora players.

"Thoughts for this game:

**TSM:**

* You can see the lack of synergy between the TSM members on that failed dive top where Hauntzer accidently ate Sven

* Bjergsen's Syndra play is so good. Really wish she was a meta pick last season because he is a monster on her. **Edit:** *Went back and rewatched parts of the game, his play wasn't as good as I originally stated. It was by no means terrible but below his usual standard for Syndra.*

* Yellow/Double have a strong 2v2 but the synergy is lacking, I fully expect it to get better as the season goes on.

* Yellow's Bard ults were fairly lacking

* Beautiful kiting from TSM at 31mins. Waited out all the TL engages and turned it around flawlessly.

* You can see some hesitation on engages but it's easy to see that the skill is there but the synergy isn't yet.

**TL:**

* The Dardoch hype is real. His first two ganks were on point and I fully expect him to be TL's starting jungler by next split, if not this split. (I believe IWD has been wanting to retire for a while)

*  Nice turn around on the TSM engage at ~21mins. 

* Matt's Alistar play was really good, had a lot of clutch knockups

* No comment on Fenix's ori ults this game. He rarely got key members in them and that ult at ~41mins was just so WTF. You can't attempt to be a hero at that late into the game. 

* Forgot to mention Lourlo/Piglet but they've played really well the past two games. Lourlo/Piglet especially this game were on point.",226

The very moment the queue was taken down and everything was reverted, there was a fantastically close 40 minute game.. where you faced a Ryze and tilted into oblivion.

"As someone who played with Xpecial for 1.5 years I can say that there are a lot of intangibles that he brings to a team that a lot of people don't give him credit for.  He's someone that always tries to focus a team, whether that be bringing up timers and getting people to stay ready for the next objective or calling people out when they lose concentration in scrims, he will always do his best to make sure people are trying to improve in scrims and not wasting time.  Besides for that he's also someone that will manage vision for the team, he will tell people where to put their wards, remind people to buy pink wards and coordinate sweepers/pinks around objectives.  There are other things that he brings to the table because of his experience but these two things are in my opinion his 2 most valuable intangibles.
Generally speaking people exaggerate his dropoff in mechanics because of a missed tibbers a regular season game vs TSM and 2-3 missed pulverizes vs Gravity.  Being ""passed his prime"" in terms of mechanics only means that he is no longer the standout best western support.  I still think that his mechanics are better than average for LCS level.
All in all I truly believe that Xpecial will find an LCS team and can prove a lot of the communities criticisms to be wrong.  I'm sure i'll see him at LCS again some day.  (Didn't spell check or proof read at all since im in queue, but i hope you get the point)",846

"I don't know why they disregard the value of empty spaces. 

They tried to go for the overly simplistic approach with large everything, but don't respect the factors which help guiding the eye. Therefore it's really hard to gather information on a glance, everything seems bloated.

And - while it is currently very fashionable (and good/readable) to simplify (see iOS 8, Windows Phone/Metro, Google Logo ... countless others) they then go ahead and add this weird shading, which totally breaks the uniform vertical/horizontal lines.

Oh well. Someone had to approve that design, so I guess someone liked it. 

I am 100% certain this would not have been approved as a visual language/design in any relevant big software company. ESPN or any news channel would not have something like this today (unlike their LCS 3D transitions with the respective logos, which could air anywhere really). And gladly the Riot design for the actual game is pretty consistent.

EDIT: Speaking of LCS production value, look at the logos behind the analyst desk. What is this, was it someone who worked with Photoshop for the first time and had to cut out the logo?

"I don't agree that ""hedging your bets"" means you're only doing it for fan service. When you legitimately have no idea who is going to win there's nothing wrong with saying ""it could go either way but I expect this to happen."" The point of saying that is to establish that both teams are quite even. If you were guessing SKT vs. BKT you would have no problem saying they'd win 3-0. 
  
That's just called being reasonable. It's not being a coward if you pick a winner without saying ""Without a doubt they will win."" It sounds like Thoorin just wants people to make bold predictions even if they don't necessarily believe it. Sometimes you can see either side winning and it's okay to say that, and it's certainly *not* bad analysis to explain why either side can take it. That makes it the opposite of what Thoorin's claiming, which is that such analysis is a disservice to the viewer...In reality it makes it more compelling to watch when an analyst can explain why it's a close matchup.

Maybe strategy games with a huge number of units, but that doesn't describe most of the popular ones.

"I love explaining this, because I love Illaoi's character and am deeply saddened by her state.

So, I am going to assume you know what a power budget is. Illaoi's entire power budget is in her damage/tentacles and especially in her ult. This means a few things.

One: She has an excessive focus on punishment and counterplay. When you get hit, you get hit REALLY FUCKING HARD. On the other hand, her hits are extremely easy to dodge. This means that skilled opponents will never have a problem against her, while low elo players will think she's OP. There's actually a second interpretation that feeds into those two facts as well: Because she is so balanced in the name of counterplay(easily countered, high punishment for failure to do so), the player of Illaoi actually has very little agency. Counterplay exists in the enemy, not in the player. Illaoi doesn't have any real ways to make plays. The entire focus is on the opponent's skill. This makes her very unsatisfying and hard to impact the game with.

Two: Her power budget is so heavily invested in her damage that every other aspect of her has to be weak. Among juggernauts, she is probably the squishiest, her healing is barely there(and again, completely negated by her easy counterplay).  She has no soft CC that doesn't take forever to apply and isn't subject to easy counterplay. The Vessel Status is almost a non-factor (tentacles take 10 seconds to spawn, each tentacle can only swing once at a vessel and they spawn and swing at normal, slow speed). Furthermore, for a zone control champion, Illaoi has an extremely slow personal spawn rate for tentacles which are cleared extremely easily, and has no real control over setting up her zone outside of her ultimate. At least Heimerdinger and Zyra get to save up and place their plants/turrets at will.

Some of that may have repeated itself, but I hope the repetitions at least opened up the idea in new ways each time.

Overall, I think the solution to Illaoi is to shift her power budget out of her ult and tentacles and into the rest of her abilities. Remove a third of the damage from her tentacles, increase her healing, give her access to an easily applied slow(Darius has two), let the tentacles swing faster, let her control the spawning. These are all just various ideas for places they might move the power to make her more viable. Illaoi doesn't need her ridiculous damage, she needs lower, but still high damage(like all juggernauts) and more ability to make enemies deal with her instead of just walking away.

Edit: A further thought that I didn't remember to bring up originally: The designers WANTED Illaoi to have a way to force enemies to fight her. It is the idea behind her E. Unfortunately, Vessel status is so weak and walking away is so much better than fighting Illaoi that it becomes optimal. Until choosing to fight Illaoi is often the best option after getting hit with her E, the designers failed to properly give her an engage tool. By this reasoning, I think the best way to balance her with as few changes as possible to her kit is to make Vessel status ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING. Tentacles should swing at the vessel constantly at double speed and have more hitpoints when there is a vessel in range. Not this ""one and done"" bullshit that makes it easy to handle. Vessel status should be a real detriment, not a minor debuff, if her E is to actually convince enemies that fighting is preferable. This works well with the idea of lowering her damage ratios, because then the enemy will have more time to fight her because she won't be able to kill the soul as swiftly or as readily commit to damaging it. It also forces Illaoi to make a real decision about whether it is better to damage the soul and pursue Vessel status, or damage the enemy directly and forfeit it. Right now, damaging the enemy is always better.",144

"The actual question from the survey:

&gt; Next we’d like to ask you your thoughts and feelings about Chromas... (recolors of skins and champions that come in packs of 3 for 590 RP, available in the store).
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine that players can now purchase a ‘Skin Painter’ for certain skins--an item which would allow players to create Chromas for those skins by applying 'ink bottles' to the Skin Painter. 
&gt; 
&gt; If the Skin Painter is available for a given skin, only one Skin Painter needs to be purchased in order to make multiple Chromas for that skin. Each ink bottle will make a chroma of one color. Players can purchase multiple ink bottles for skins where the Skin Painter is available--creating as many or as few Chromas as they want.  
&gt; 
&gt; For example, for a skin where the ink bottle colors yellow and blue are available,  using a blue ink bottle with the Skin Painter will make the blue Chroma for that skin. If the yellow ink bottle is then applied to the skin painter, both blue and yellow Chromas would be unlocked.
&gt; 
&gt; Similar to Chromas now, not all skins will have the Skin Painter available for them, and the variety of ink bottle colors available for those that do would vary depending on the skin. 
&gt; 
&gt; Each Skin Painter would cost 290 RP, and come with one free bottle of ink (a single color).
&gt;  
&gt; Additional colors could be purchased for 2000 IP or 190 RP each.
&gt; 
&gt; So, in summary, the first Chroma purchased for a skin would cost 290 RP, with each additional Chroma for that skin costing 190 RP or 2000 IP each.
&gt; 
&gt; How desirable would Skin Painters (290 RP) and Ink Bottles (2000 IP or 190 RP) be to you personally?",103

"Just my opinion ~ but im pretty sick of riot saying assassins are so bad for the game and they keep super buffing tanks which is the complete opposite of healthy. Tanks lead to a lot of unhealthy things for the game... 1. Not fun to play as / against a tank IMO. 2. Tanks are generally way easier to play and really doesn't teach a lot of mechanics. 3. running into a teamfight and dishing out damage without being able to die is kind of dumb and pretty easy if you ask me. The main problem with the game currently is champs dont really reflect their roles. Tanks should be hard to kill targets with cc but no damage. Assasssins should be super hard to play high mechanic skill with insane damage, but they are super squishy. Bruisers are half damage half tanks and be favorable to 1v1 upfront duels. Mages more aoe magic damage and so on. Currently it's just faceroll tanks running around 1v1ing winning teamfights and never dying... Super unhealthy for the game.

"All these years I've noticed that people who can't grasp the idea of healthy counterplay well enough, always reply to accusations of frustrating kits with:

1. Item actives

2. Champion picks

3. Summoner Spells

4. Tactics requiring team co-ordination



All this seems like good counterplay to many, if not most people. However, the truth is that when a champion has a healthy kit, his main counterplay is more in the kit itself and less in these four (even if some of these 4 are still very helpful and recommended to counter them).

The reasons these four options do not constitute good counterplay vs a champion on their own is because:

1. Feast or famine counterplay. Frustrating for the player of the toxic champion when actives are up and for his opponent when on cooldown. Also, in a healthy balanced game, counterplay shouldn't cost gold or have cooldowns. Every champion combo should be beatable all the time.

2. Didn't think I should have to explain this but the game isn't fun when you can't win each game with the champions you love, regardless of enemies' picks. 
Of course Riot themselves have also said multiple times that their balance goal is to be able to play any champion vs any team and have your chance of winning depend more on if you play well and less on what you pick (i.e. to reduce the importance of counter-picking but still keep it in the game as an interesting strategic move).

3. Same as 1.

4. It sure is a team game but, when teams don't even group for an objective in Challenger, a champion's counterplay relying primarily on team co-ordination isn't a thoughtful idea. Also, 4 strangers' actions deciding whether you live or die isn't a base for a fun game. Team co-ordination is enjoyable and satisfying but not when substituting counterplay.



On the other hand, examples of good counterplay in kits are:

* Skillshots, 
* slow skillshot speeds (Zyra E, Lux Q), 
* casting times (Jinx R), 
* skill impact indicators (Jinx W), 
* skill effect delays (Ekko W),
* units you can disable (Gangplank E, Kallista W, Zyra plants)
* high mana costs (Lux E)
* high, abusable cooldowns (Morgana E)

Laslty, counterplay has nothing to do with win rates. Best example is Yorick; getting a rework due to how frustrating he is to play against, still not a higher than average win rate.

*TL;DR: All champions have counterplay, but there's a good and bad kind. Bad counterplay results in frustration, good counterplay results in a healthy game. Also win rates are not indicative of good counterplay or lack thereof.*

I know I'm not the only one that's duo queued with a friend and stopped when I felt like they were holding me back. By having a team oriented queue with an incentive to be selfish players will only want to queue with people that will assist them in ranking up. I doubt very many people will find 4 friends that all feel that each person on the team pulls their weight. Everyone hits a wall at some point. Ranked 5's is different because your team has one rank that is entirely independent of your solo rank. If you want to get a higher rank in dynamic queue, play alone or with better people. In ranked 5's I can have a team with my silver friends and a team with my plat friends *with entirely different team rankings*. ",1800

"**Well, Immortals is now 4 and 0, this is continuing this trend, you guys continue to win. I'm with Adrian right now, Adrian, I mean, what do you, at what point do you lose?**

**A:** Uh, never. We're never gonna lose.

**So undefeated. If I made that the Reddit thread and everybody was like, yeah, you'd endorse that, you'd back that up?**

**A:** I'd back that up, 18-0.

**18-0. Alright, so, that's happening, I guess. I mean, do you feel like you are what Fnatic was in EU LCS last split?**

**A:** Uh, we're very similar to them, like we just always, we can always come back from a losing game, and we're just really strong right now.

**And a lot of ways, I mean obviously Huni and Reignover were stars in Europe, but the other three of you guys were kind of people who were on teams, a lot of people had discussion about whether or not you were good, obviously there was a lot of talk about like oh Adrian is really good on TiP, and he's just pinned on a rough team or whatever, but what is it like to now sort of have you, Pobelter, and WildTurtle kicking ass on this team?**

**A:** It feels really good, actually, like we're all the outcasts on our previous teams, and like, it feels really good to prove everyone wrong.

**Do you guys ever have those conversations, like behind the scenes, like after you went 2-0, or after yesterday when you won the game - Impact trolling off camera right now - and whenever that happens, you went 2-0, do you have conversations where you're all sitting around dinner just being like damn, this feels good.**

**A:** Yeah, it feels really good, like we beat our old teammates, and we beat people who replaced us, and yeah it feels really good.

**Do you guys talk about that though?**

**A:** Yeah, definitely talk about it, it's really funny to talk about, it's good discussion.

**It's interesting, I mean, Immortals was a company, a lot of people have, it's rumors is that they're spending a lot of money and that they're willing to invest a lot into this. I got to imagine they're feeling pretty good about it, are you getting that sense from them?**

**A:** Yeah, I bet they're really happy about it, like we're really good, and they're really happy that we're delivering.

**So I talked to Meteos just a second ago, and he told me to ask you about a dirty Janna picker. Do you care to comment on Meteos's accusations?**

**A:** Janna is a high skill champion, it takes really high skill to play it at a high level. It might look easy but it's not.

**For people who are more casual LCS watchers, why do you enjoy Janna so much?**

**A:** People like engaging, but I like disengaging, like people's engages, like it makes them look even dumber. Yeah.

**So that's, you just like it from a style perspective, like it's less about the actual game, you're just like, I can do really cool stuff with this?**

**A:** Yeah I can do really cool stuff, like I can deny people from making plays, and I can save my teammates, Turtle goes a little crazy sometimes.

**So it's just like a very high level of control that you're bringing to the table.**

**A:** Yeah, definitely.

**What other supports do you enjoy right now, or what are sort of things that you enjoy in this patch?**

**A:** I like playing champions like Soraka, and Soraka. It's really fun making people mad playing against me, cuz they're prone to tilt, and try to focus you, but you keep cool and just know that they're gonna try and kill you, you just bait them into really dumb situations and they make bad decisions all the time.

**You bring up the tilting thing, it's very funny cuz I feel like a lot of people, you know, almost everybody just makes the champion picks off of, oh I think that this is a good counterpick, or I think that this is something that will go well in this lane, and this comp. You seem to also be picking for a mental component of like, I'm gonna tilt them, and then they're gonna play worse.**

**A:** Yeah, like there's always two ways to play a matchup, like I can win the worst matchup on Alistar, Janna, but people can't play it against me, so it's really good.

**Now, I also want to talk to you about Dynamic Queue, cuz I've heard a lot of different things from a lot of different people about dynamic queue. Pobelter was saying he's cool with it, what do you think?**

**A:** It's pretty cool, like everytime we play dynamic queue as a team, we just stomp on everyone, even LCS teams, so it's pretty bad.

**But, does that allow you to get better? Is that good to be queued up as a five man team going against just like a pub?**

**A:** Yeah, it's like, really bad for the pub, like, maybe they can learn and show off that they beat us, somehow.

**Yeah, I mean, it's good for the pub, I'm wondering if it's good for you guys, cuz you're trying to train and get better, or is for you, whenever you guys do that, is it just more like just having fun and you're not even really worrying about anything.**

**A:** We don't really worry about anything, we're not trying too hard, but like it feels bad to lose to randoms, though.

**Now, everything besides that going good on Immortals? I'm just doing these checkins because I feel like everything's really good when you're winning, I know you're winning right now, but I'm worried that at some point in time, something's gonna go wrong, Huni will accidentally eat something that belongs to someone else in the fridge, and then everybody gets in a huge fight.**

**A:** Life is good, like I think we have really good mentality, and we can come back from losses. Even in scrims, we don't win every scrim, but we can come back from it, because we know we're good players.

**Anyone at all, I ask this question I think to Huni last week, anyone at all that you guys are afraid of?**

**A:** I'm not really afraid of anyone right now, but I think our toughest competition would probably be either CLG or TSM later in the split.

**I expect TSM to powerup.**

**A:** Yeah, I expect them to get better somewhat.

**Is there anything that you would like to say to any of the Immortals fans, the people who are like, oh, I've been a TSM fan for years, but I don't like their new AD Carry, like anything that you want to say?**

**A:** Not really, lol

"TL;DR: REN had good early execution, horrible mid game. Their team comp was far superiour to TL as tanks are super OP and TL didn't have a Trundle to counter. The tanks let them to teamfight without dying and have good consistent dmg throughout.

Just some thoughts about the game from a diamond supp main, feel free to disagree. I feel like I can never find a good discussion in the post match discussions, so instead of waiting for one I'll try to create one myself :)

All in all it was a pretty exciting game, good execution from REN early but horrible mid game. TL lost in PB I think.

So, Thresh is always banned vs Remilia. What's interesting is that she usually picks Morgana or Braum, so one of them usually gets banned and/or picked, but this time she picked Ali. Many were worried about her champion pool, but she seems to have expanded on it since she picked a 4th champion when she could have picked one of the previous stated. (I think she was decent on Janna?). edit: I'll agree the play wasn't that good, but it's good that Remi shows confidence in other champs outside of her trinity.

Pretty good lane swap from Renegades, picking on the least experienced players in Lourlo and Smoothie to gain advantages. Lourlo and Smoothie weren't that impressive this game.

Two great match ups in this game; Alex vs Fenix &amp; Freeze vs Piglet.

Orianna vs Viktor is a farm/poke match up, IMO in the favour of Viktor due to more sustained poke than Ori. Alex took ignite however, which makes it into a Ori-favoured lane IMO if Ori gets the opportunity to all in. We saw him all in around the 11 minute mark, but this really didn't gain him any advantages, so honestly the ignite was kinda useless other than relieving some pressure from Alex (Viktor still had a 20+ cs adv by 10 minutes IIRC). I think it’s interesting to compare Fenix’s Viktor build to GBM, because it really shows how important Fenix was for TL. GBM got WOTA and Rylais and played front line while Fenix got LB and void staff. Fenix had a tank top/semi-carry top while GBM had a carry top (Fiora), so he ahd to build much more dmg and play back line.

We really saw how much REN focused on Fenix, like around the 13, 18, 23 and 28 minute marks where they used every cooldown and, in the 13/23 mins play, some summoner spells. 

Freeze vs Piglet was pretty interesting, as both players had solid enviroments around them. Freeze had a strong front line in Mundo/Rek sai, good supporting from Ori and peeling from Ali. Mundo/Rek/Ali can also very easily go from attacking to peeling or vice versa. They had good engage with the Orianna and Alistar, with Rek Sai and Mundo as follow up engage.

Piglet had a strong front liner in Gnar, with a strong independant mid laner in Viktor. This removes focus on Piglet, which means he can play much more agressively, which is still kinda hard vs REN's comp. Of course, the same thing goes for Fenix. He then had good peel &amp; support from Elise and Janna, so REN's comp was much more focused on Piglet and Fenix doing good. We could see in every team fight or skirmish that Piglet played agressive whenever possible.

IMO, REN had a much better comp than TL. Due to the changes to LW and no Trundle on TL, TL really couldn't kill REN's front lines, and Mundo + Rek deal good dmg for tanks, which meant that REN would just have good, constant damage without dying and good CC. 

What I really liked with REN was that every time they did an agressive play they tried to get an objective. They kept on all inning Fenix every 5 mins and did turret dmg or took a drake after. 

TL had really bad vision, absolutely horrible vision. Basically one player had placed three wards at baron by 40 mins and they had none out by 52 mins. Really boring tp’s from Lourlo as a result.",141

I never really watched gosu or know who he's close with, but I hope someone does seriously reach out to him to help because this guy needs it. Props to trick and aphro though for handling such a bizarre situation, correctly. Hope this all turns out okay in the end.",325
