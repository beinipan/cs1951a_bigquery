"&gt;Keynes fell out of favor in the '70s because Milton Friedman discovered that there didn't have to be a trade off between inflation and unemployment. Then the 'freshwater school' (to be very broad) of Macroeconomic thought decided that anything Keynes said was garbage and has spent the past 35 years being wrong.

You're being rather generous. Keynes fell out of favor because monetarists' predictions (in particular, those of Hayek and Friedman) about Keynisian economics proved correct--over the long-term it falls into unavoidable problems  revolving around liquidity traps and stagflation. In other words, it is quite possible to manipulate markets (i.e., ""control the heights"") in the short term, but over a longer view it can't help but fail. 

Nothing has changed since the 70s except for the realization that Keynesian economics--from a Statist perspective--is much more desirable because of the control effects it provides to those in governance. But that's not a macroeconomic perk or alteration, just a political one.

&gt;No recent events have done anything to validate the Austrian worldview. For that matter, no historical events have either. But why let the facts get in the way of a nice ideology.

Bullshit. Keynesian economics produced explosive failures in countries around the world, prime among them include India and dozens of South American nations. 

India, for its part, rejected the Keynesian foundations that got it into so much trouble during the 60s and 70s, transforming first into a mixed-model during the 80s and finally abandoning it almost wholesale since 1991. It has since encountered a booming and prosperous economic growth of a sort it never experienced in the half-century of Keynesian models it followed.

China, in more recent times, has also clearly moved from a Keynesian control approach to a mixed-Austrian, market-driven one. It's been a primary dimension to their success over the last two decades.

&gt;Could you expand on why you think hyperinflation is coming in 2018?

I'm not predicting hyperinflation. Certainly not just yet. But I think we'll see severe inflation ramping up sometime just before the 2020s. We're less than five years into what may arguably be the largest liquidity trap ever constructed. 

Such a large trap is taking time to ""mature"" (for lack of a better word). It seems pretty clear that one is underway, however, just by looking at the cash hoarding being done--not by people, but by corporations. Interest rates remain near bottom and expectations (as seen in bond markets and precious metals) all appear to confirm this situation. 

So, why 2018? That date approximates the mid-point of a new political administration. 

Obama will win in the upcoming election and whomever takes over in the following election will be forced to deal with the [Keynesian Endpoint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_endpoint) that now lingers within view. That's approximately when the dominoes will start to tumble, by my estimate. There just won't be anything more that the administration can do to keep up the charade.",1

You know why? Because just like every liberal will tell you, even if Obama is a muslim, he isn't going to be imposing sharia law on the US just like Ron Paul isn't going to be imposing religion on people. It's rather hypocritical.

"The last quote was further illustrating how he's not an isolationist.  

And Qaddafi only began ""threatening"" the US after the UN began discussing a no-fly zone over Libya.  Obviously he is going to say he will strike back, why wouldn't he?  And the parenthetical comment is in reference to the fact that both the US and EU were selling weapons, ammunition and equipment to the Qaddafi regime as recent as the 3rd quarter of 2010.

""the neo-conservative Bush"", Bush is a neo-conservative, not the policy.  Neo-conservatism is a strongly interventionist philosophy.  

As for the first 3 paragraphs:  I could see an argument that Obama isn't an interventionist, I totally disagree but it's an argument that could be made. And yes, he hasn't been quite so hawkish as previous administrations, but he is far from isolationist in foreign policy (or domestic policy for that matter but that's not what we're talking about).  Then again, he never voted against a single Defense Department Authorization bill (aside from 2008 when he and McCain both abstained).  We aren't involved in Bahrain because (I'll give him credit for this) Obama is at least smart enough not to get us involved in Saudi Arabia and Iran's proxy war.  

And I for one would have been happy if Obama did not get involved in Libya, I would have said nothing about it being tacit approval of Qaddafi.  Sure, pundits would have, but getting involved in a civil war to silence people who are going to complain regardless is to me a terrible idea.

I understand that there are a lot of people who wanted us to get involved in Libya because they feel strongly it is the right thing to do.  But our military is already stretched thin from wars that seemed like a good idea at the time and our history is rife with examples of our meddling in other countries turning out to be a very, very bad idea.  For instance, arming and training the Mujahideen seemed like a good way to fight the Soviet Union and spread democracy without getting into another Vietnam.  Yet that arming and training of the Mujahideen directly led to our current war in Afghanistan.  

I hope I'm wrong though.  I hope I'm completely totally wrong, because if things go the way I fear they're going to go, Libya will end at best as Somalia and at worst as Afghanistan.  I want Obama to be right, I hope Libya ends up as a functioning democracy lead by Jeffersonian liberals.  But I'm just extremely skeptical, as there's plenty of examples of the most well meaning interventions turning to a big shit sandwich post-haste.

I do not at all shut out conservative discourse.


I do shut out tea party drivel. Because it's not honest.

"Cons:

 - Supports the War on Drugs, which is a war on minorities that allows the police state to grow, and expands the power of the drug lords in Mexico.

 - Supports the same interventionist foreign policy that Bush followed. 
 
 - Supports The Patriot Act.  Extended and expanded this piece of shit that was originally penned by Biden.  If you vote for Obama then you are voting for more of this big brother shit.

 - Supports the ""too big to fail"" banks.  We've handed them hundreds of billions and if you vote for Obama you're supporting more of the same.  He WILL continue to watch his buddies at Goldman Sachs loot you and your grandkids.

 - Supports deficit spending.  The federal government borrows over 40% of what it spends.  That is not sustainable.  Bush SUCKED for this very same reason.  


Pros:

 - We know where he stands now.  In '08 we heard a lot of ""hope"" and ""change"" but most people didn't know what he would do once in office (some actually thought he was just *acting* like a war hawk to get elected.. and then he would come out of the closet as an anti-war president.  ha).

 - At least he's not John McCain.

 - Unlike Newt he hasn't cheated on his wife.

 - Millions of minorities who voted for him see that having him in the White House really didn't improve their lives very much, so maybe they won't fall for the race card in the next election and instead they'll actually vote for a good candidate.

 - The words ""Hope"" and ""Change"" won't be used by campaigns for a long, long time.",1

There's a reason why people say that there is no left in the US, because even the Democrats are to the right of right-wing groups in the mods' countries.

I'm not really sure what you're saying though.  I'm talking about how Democrats defended F&amp;F against desired increased regulations.   Remember, you were saying how Bush got all he wanted and I pointed out this wasn't the case, etc.

Seems like you've now jumped off on some tangent about costs and what not.  As if saying the F&amp;F bailout was a drop in the bucket magically absolves Democrats for claiming F&amp;F didn't have a problem and opposed regulations.

&gt;Repeal the tax cuts and the debt problems go away, it is the elephant in the room.

Repealing the cuts as a whole would indeed do a bit for our deficit (debt though? 14+ trillion, lol).  Though what you're suggesting amounts to a huge increase in taxes on the middle class and even poor.  Sure, the rich would pay more too, but those who can't really afford it will not be happy.  Just repealing the part for the rich won't do much for our deficit though 9at least according to all those posts I read here about congress doing nothing and fixing everything faerie tale).

"Well, see, he is a socialist.

It's just that americans associated socialism with ""bad"" or ""Crazy fascist regimes"" so much they won't admit it.

But so was George W. Bush. In fact, America became socialist in its most basic sense when the Federal Reserve was created.

Here's a few of the primary purposes of the Federal Reserve from wikipedia:

To serve as the central bank for the United States

To strike a balance between private interests of banks and the centralized responsibility of government

To supervise and regulate banking institutions

To protect the credit rights of consumers

To manage the nation's money supply through monetary policy to achieve the sometimes-conflicting goals of:
maximum employment; stable prices, including prevention of either inflation or deflation; moderate long-term interest rates

To maintain the stability of the financial system and contain systemic risk in financial markets.

Social security, unions, public education, public law enforcement, public emergency services, emergency response services, government cheese, and many others all fit the definition of socialism.

Public healthcare is no different in principle than public education. It's a government regulated industry that allows access to all classes and that guarantees equal opportunity to receive rights and entitlements and it's common and paid by the public through imposed taxation.

Obama is a socialist. And so are all Republicans except for a tiny few like Ron Paul.

"&gt;First; didn't W start a war without Congressional approval?

No. Well, sort of. Congress never issued a declaration of war, but they did pass the [Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Terrorists) authorizing the invasion of Afghanistan and the [Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_for_Use_of_Military_Force_Against_Iraq_Resolution_of_2002) authorizing the war in Iraq. This isn't particularly notable; of the enormous list of [military actions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_actions_of_the_United_States) taken by the US, only eleven came with a [Congressional declaration of war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States). Of those eleven, six of them were declared against the axis forces in WWII, and two of them were against the axis forces in WWI. The US hasn't declared war since 1942, despite the fact that Korea, Vietnam, both Iraq wars, Afghanistan, and Bosnia qualify as wars by any standard and there are numerous other skirmishes (greneda, panama, somalia, liberia, lebanon, haiti...) that come close.

&gt;Where did that money come from?

The money to *start* the war didn't come from anywhere; there was no money in the beginning. They got boots in the dirt using the normal operational budgets. It was very small units with discretionary funding. According to wikipedia, the first troops on the ground were the CIA's special activities division. Then US Army Special Forces. Then USSOCOM. Air support was done with long range bombers based in existing US bases and from aircraft carriers; no permanent bases existed in the beginning of the war.

Funding - *real* funding - came later.

&gt;Second; did Congress give W money to build Gitmo and to move people to Gitmo?

I don't know. Believe it or not, there's a lot you can do without funding. Materials exist in stockpiles. So do stockpiles of supplies needed to set up a camp in a hostile environment. The military has a lot of personnel whose pay is not tied to doing a specific duty. (ask a pre-9/11 infantry guy about painting rocks or painting grass) It doesn't take a lot of money to gather a bunch of cinderblocks and chain link fence and a lot of warm bodies to slap together a makeshift prison on a military base that's surrounding by the second largest minefield in the world. The prison at gitmo was, at the time, by no means a supermax. Even if they escaped their cells, and the fences, there is absolutely nowhere to run.

&gt;Third; Let's assume that the President can only propose and that Congress has to finance. Isn't this the easiest win on the books? If the President gets in front of a microphone and demands the return of the Gitmo detainees, and explains that he's hamstrung by the currently Republican Congress, wouldn't it work out for the best for him, regardless of whether the prisoners come back?

The Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats, not the Republicans, passed the [amendment that blocked funding](http://www.webcitation.org/5jPWyaCDq) to move the detainees. And it passed the amendment by a 90-6 majority. Of the six that voted to fund the closing, no less than two of them were Republicans. (the article names two, and says that those are ""of the few"" that voted against the amendment) So making a partisan Republican vs Democrat issue out of it would be spectacularly ludicrous.

&gt;Fourth; it seems the President has the ability to create initiatives and drives and whatnot, from thin air. Then he gets a big ol' batch of cash from Congress to complete said initiative. Where's Obama's ""close Gitmo"" initiative?

It's not Obama's style. For better or for worse, if George W Bush had wanted it done, he would pile all of them into a C-5 and fly them to Leavenworth, and worry about all the bureaucratic shit later. Similar to how he invaded Afghanistan and built the Gitmo detention facility in the first place.

&gt; Fifth; we aren't talking about a tonne of people. From what I understand, there are less than 200 prisoners. The US military moves more soldiers than that around in a month. The US military must have some form of travel budget, or ""operations"" budget. Gitmo is a US military installation, managed and controlled by US military personal, who are flown/bussed/rickshawed/whatever in and out of Gitmo on a standard rotation. Wouldn't Obama simply have to order the US military to move detainees from location X to location Y (Y being in USA proper), and that becomes a budget issue for the military to worry about?

See above. Also, the US military moves more than 200 soldiers around every hour of every day.",1

This is a racist request. To be annoyed at Obama for not picking more blacks is to ask him to make position choices based on race, not merit. There's no evidence that Obama made his choices based on anything but merit, so to accuse him of race-based decisions doesn't stick.

This, combined with Christine's preceding statement about most blacks not caring to talk to conservatives, provides enough circumstantial evidence, in my opinion, to conclude that she is looking at the entire issue through a racial lens.

"It certainly is not impossible.  That said, how much authority do you want the government to have regulating what you do with your money?  Furthermore, would it even truly address the problem?

What is the problem, exactly... that politics are steered by money?  Maybe, then, it's the cost of campaigning that really needs to be addressed.  After all, if campaigns didn't cost hundreds of millions of dollars to run, candidates wouldn't need to seek the support of big businesses, right?  This leads some to believe that elections should be funded by the government, strictly through taxation.  I think this argument is entirely fallacious, and, as *Citizens United* and *Hillary: The Movie* demonstrate, there is more than one method of disseminating a message (any of which cost money).

MovetoAmend's proposal is shortsighted and naive.  Their assertion that ""money is not speech"" should cause you to react with a violent facepalm.  Not just because the [Supreme Court ruled money to be speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo) 30 years ago, but because it is flawed to suggest that a monetary donation does not inherently indicate your support of whatever institution you are donating to.  It's beyond rhetoric-- it's silly.

Particularly because corruption isn't limited to campaign dollars, [soft money or hard money](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/hard-money-soft-money.asp#axzz1W515Ndfj).  (Remember, this MovetoAmend argument is only considering the regulation of CAMPAIGN dollars).  There is a revolving door between business and government, and the stepping stones between them transcend individual campaigns.

Just recently we've seen the [FCC chairwoman leave for Comcast](http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/f-c-c-commissioner-to-join-comcast/) and Obama appoint a [Monsanto exec to the Department of Agriculture](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=18499) and a [banking mogul to SEC Chief](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/19/us-financial-regulation-gallagher-idUSTRE74H7E220110519) who was (at best) complicit during the financial collapse.

Does Obama really need to keep the door revolving in order to win in 2012?  Probably not.  If a Republican contender managed to usurp the presidency in 2012, would it put an end to the revolving door?  Probably not.  Again, the self-perpetuating business-government relationship has transcended campaigns.  It's now about the perpetuation of the political parties.  Maybe the problem is that corruption is facilitated more easily because the American political system is stifled by the Republican/Democrat duopoly.

I'm convinced that until the two-party system is undermined, this sweeping corruptibility will remain steadfast.  The Democrat-Republican dichotomy purport ideological differences, but when it comes to big business interests, they manage to form an unholy alliance.

If we were to disempower the two parties and allow for a multiple-party system, as user [jaggederest](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jsgo0/we_the_people_of_the_united_states_of_america/c2et69k?context=2) alludes to in this thread, corruptibility will be increasingly difficult if there appear to be a number of viable alternatives.  Is there so much money that it is possible to corrupt ALL political parties, no matter how numerous?  Probably.  But picking and choosing campaigns and parties to invest in would become quite a cumbersome and costly task; the return on those investments would certainly not be so great.  The two-party system mitigates all that volatility, insuring the investments.

Anyway, I'm rambling.  A fundamental change to the election process would help create a political atmosphere that is self-regulating WITHOUT maligning the voting constituency and WITHOUT inhibiting free speech.",1
No.  Biden was clapping and put his hand out as Obama was turning.,3
"&gt;No, they should not. But there is a big difference between handing out pamphlets slandering a politician and making huge donations and endorsements of a candidate in return for political favors.

I was defending free speech; what you are talking about is corporatism. As you said, this is when the private sector colludes with the government for favorable legislation in exchange for campaign funding. You want to cut out the campaign funding part of the equation, but that is the wrong part to focus on, and I'll tell you why. Eliminating, or regulating, campaign donations violates free speech and freedom of association. I just explained how people can get together to create political content, and that the government should not stifle that form of expression. Besides, putting aside the freedom argument, big campaign financing is an *effect* of corporatism, not the cause. You are targeting a symptom not the disease.

As you know, corporations, unions, whomever, don't necessarily donate to campaigns or set up politically motivated content just cuz... they do it because they are lobbying for a message, or seeking compensation in the form of favorable regulations. In other words, they only spend such huge amounts on ""politicking"" because they are trying get something in return. Regulating the amount of spending doesn't prevent the political favors from being doled out, necessarily. In the best case scenario it makes rent-seeking cheaper for the corporations and in the worst case the reforms won't work at all and the regulators waste a ton of resources trying. 

As I said, rent-seeking is the effect, the government's openness for rent is the cause. Instead of attacking campaign financiers for their *voluntary* donations, actions, and content; turn your ire on the government who, instead of doing only their constitutional duties, has announced that it is available for the highest bidder. If government had no favors to grant, no ability regulate the marketplace, then the corporations would have no reason to spend so much on lobbying. Instead the corporations would have to focus on making their consumers happy. You take away government's for rent sign, rent seekers won't go to Washing looking for favors. They will have to focus their efforts on main street instead.

&gt;Back during the elections Barack talked a big game about minimizing lobbyists (which he failed to deliver). This isn't a whole lot different than lobbying, it's merely greasing the wheels prior to the candidate even getting elected.

Lobbying can be a good thing. Besides the free speech, free association argument, there is the utilitarian argument that the regulations simply won't work. I want people ""lobbying"" for the things they want. Not all political lobbying is bad. Whats bad is when the government announces that it is open for business and that legislatures are willing to do favors for their corporate donors. If they were unable to do those favors, their would be no need for the corporations to even try the lobby for shit they couldn't get.

No, what they are saying, is that Obama is using the same tactic. If republicans keep on doing ""X"", then then I will take away ""Y"" from your strongest voting demographic. 

If he had any balls and was actually concerned about this country's welfare, he would threaten to pull money from these pointless wars, instead of senior citizens. Just because you voted for him doesn't mean you can't change your mind. 

I don't understand why reddit is so anti Fox News. Fox has been infiltrated by the same elites that control MSNBC and CNN. They are covering all their bases by pandering to the right with Fox. Do you remember when Ron Paul won the CPAC straw poll? Fox edited the footage to make it seem like no one liked the results. The puppet-masters are afraid of Ron Paul, and they are going to make damn sure he doesn't get ""darling Obama"" style coverage from anybody.

"The Government and Accountability Office is an independent office of the legislative branch established to give critical and nonpartisan assessments of federal activities. Of course, there are biases in EVERYTHING, but the GAO has well established integrity. Although the article I gave you links to the report, you can also find it [here]( http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg_default) (it's the 6/24 link under 'what's new'). The report is a solid 172 pages long and refers to other OMB and cabinet reports, but around page 100 it explains the standards of cost/benefit assessments. I don't think it's a particularly legitimate argument to just simply say 'you're facts are wrong because Obama lies.' But if you still insist that regulations don't produce GDP profits [here is another report from the EPI arguing that, ""the combined annual benefits from all final rules exceed their costs by $32 billion to $142 billion a year. The benefit/cost ratio ranges from 4-to-1 to 22-to-1,""](http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/tallying_up_the_impact_of_new_epa_rules) and [here is one highlighting how the costs of regulation are almost uniformly grossly overestimated](http://www.grist.org/article/climate-math-how-the-chicken-littles-cook-the-numbers).

The reason that regulations actually save money is because of something I briefly touched on in my previous comment: [externalities.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality) Regulations cost manufacturers money not because they are adding costs to production, but because they are taking costs that are currently externalized out of the final cost of the product and internalizing them. For instance, if you currently make gadgets at $5 a unit, but dump sludge waste into the nearby pond, $5 isn't the real cost of the product because the manufacturer isn't paying for the poisoned pond (instead, it's paid for by higher cancer rates, pollution cleanup costs, destroyed environment). If the EPA comes in and regulates dumping sludget and now gadgets cost $7 but all the sludge is cleaned up, the cost is merely being internalized into the product. THAT is what regulation saves more money than it costs.",1
"I'm a liberal...a true liberal. The archenemy of the Fox News crowd. As stated clearly here, many liberals don't support Obama at this point. And let's be honest...you do NOT want to compare Bush with Obama. I'm a realist...I'm not uneducated or uninformed. So let's not go down that path. 

And why are the republicans the only ones demanding that 'both sides are the same'? Because the republicans have 30+ years trying to destroy the middle class, create loopholes for corporations, break the backs of the unions and the working class Americans. 

If you don't acknowledge that, you're simply saying you haven't studied history. It's that simple. Dems are just gettin their sea legs...hey HAVE supported the unions...they have tried to get the rich and corporations to pay more taxes. 

And more importantly, if you think 'both sides are the same,' you have absolutely no understanding of what the bases for each party really want. Democratic base DOES want corporations taxes harder and DOES. Want the Bush tax cuts repealled. 

Cannot say the same for the republican base...not even close. I could spend hours pointing out the differences between the two parties. And if it has to be pointed out to you that the ideals of OWS are in line with the base of the democrats, again, you simply understand way too little about American history and politics. I'm sorry that's such a mental hurdle for the right but it's the truth. Line up the demands of OWS and you'll see a list of liberal based ideals. Where republicans can justify agreeing to taxing the rich more and closing loopholes for corporations when their leaders have fought so hard to defend those for the past 30 years is kind of laughable. 

And to the kooky Ron Paul supporter who is suggesting the Paul is the figurehead of OWS, you're out of your mind. Those people were called the tea party and they sold their asses to the Koch brothers. And now they're all but gone because the koches dropped funding after they and Sarah Palin convinced these uneducated fools into votin for the interests of the very rich and corporations rather than their OWN interests. 

So get the fuck out of here with the nonexistent Ron Paul - OWS connection. ",1
"That's an unfair swipe.  Right now the DEA and the various states that have legalized marijuana are in direct conflict over enforcement.  Obama is, ultimately, the boss of the DEA.  When he fails to rein in his staff, he tacitly condones allowing federal drug trafficking laws to restrict in-state legal distributors.

Beyond that, while the White House can't directly legalize marijuana, the President can put marijuana legalization (or at least decriminalization) at the head of the Democratic agenda.

While a lot of people are overreacting, I don't think the general efforts intended to bring the issue to the White House's attention are in vain.  These petitions have encouraged pollsters and political strategists to start testing the waters on changing the MJ laws.  They've served as a rallying call for the movement and a catalyst to begin a new round of organizing for changes to the law.  That, in and of itself, is a good thing.  I signed the original petition and I'll be happy to sign every new petition people throw up, if it continues to drive organization and action to change the terrible laws currently on the books.",8

"In 2012, anything that Obama has done is automatically socialist so it does not matter what Obama has done or has not done. The GOP base will basically buy any talking point the propagandists put out.

But maybe if Obama had stood his ground at the very start on the stimulus and HCR debates, Republicans wouldn't be running him over at every turn. Remember there was no need for adding Republican provisions into the stimulus and HCR bills because ZERO Republicans voted for those bills and yet they still passed. Obama has and will always continue to sellout his own base instead of fighting the opposition party because it doesn't cost him anything. His base still thinks he's an honest to goodness liberal when he's in fact shown time and time again to be right of center on economic and fiscal policy.",3
"Also see [Gary Johnson](http://ouramericainitiative.com/) who is anti-war, and pro-legalization.

I'm a journalist. I only care about the facts. I'm intelligent enough to form my own opinion from the facts without having to have one shoved down my throat by biased or misleading thread titles.

"&gt;That means against the person. He's not going after anyone there: not the poster, not the people who wrote the articles, merely the reputability of (some of) the sites cited.

An ad hominem attack doesn't require on attack on just one person, it can be against a group of people, in this case the people who work at the various places he attempted to discredit.  Hence why it was an ad hominem. 

Instead of dealing with the actual issues brought up in the articles he chose to attack those who brought them up.

&gt;First of all, Sarstan isn't trying to refute the facts. He is only pointing out that some of the sources cited are disreputable, and thus worthy of less credulity.

Yes, that would be the problem.

&gt;The burden of proof, by the way, lies with the person making the claim, not the one calling the person out on it.

The person making the claim in this case provided sources, and instead of attacking the sources (and he/she didn't even bother to mention which ones he was declaring were bullshit), Sarstan should have either refuted them or the commenter's claims.

&gt;Besides, it is very easy to see that dprogram.net is not reputable: there is no information on who maintains the site (snipped out bs)

You are truly an idiot.  That is an ad hominem, you're attacking the source instead of the content.  

Secondly, the article in question isn't even written by dprogram.net. There is a link at the bottom to the source[IndiaExpress](http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Obama-quietly-authorises-expansion-of-war-in-Pakistan/548972), attempting to discredit dprogram.net is pointless as they didn't even write it.  

Feel free to explain what's wrong with the CONTENT.

Again, what is incorrect with the article that's cited?

&gt;Oh, and fun fact: the writers on dprogram—whoever the hell they may be—cited that as being from ""Indiana Express,"" as in the state, when it is actually from Indian Express, as in the sovereign nation. Any doubts of the unreliability of dpgrogram.net should now be erased. 

No, they didn't.  At the top it says in parentheses (IndianExpress).  The link at the bottom is spelled incorrectly yes, but leads to the ARTICLE AT IndianExpress.com.

Maybe if the Democratic party wasn't made up of weak-willed jellyfish, that wouldn't be a problem.  Maybe that is what the majority of the country will decide to vote for, is the author against democracy?

As for a world-wide depression, the current administration and previous 5 or so, have done a fine job in shoving us toward that hole, thank you.  Paul's credentials in economic policy are rock solid.  Everything that he's predicted would happen to the economy has happened.

Paul's ""restrained"" foreign policy?  How about a complete reversal of endless war?

Wrong. I am mad that Obama is President, but it has nothing to do with his race. Of the current GOP field, Herman Cain is my 3rd choice (behind Paul and Johnson).

Race matters to me about as much as BMI or hair color, which is to say not at all.

* Supreme Court health reform ruling - If they rule for Obama, a lot of people will be pissed off about the mandates that Obama criticized last election and supports now (the way the ad will be framed to piss them off more).  Others will be pissed that the GOP Supreme Court took down health reform.  If they rule against Obama a lot of people will think Obama wants to go beyond Constitutional authority but others will think we need Obama because the GOP won't fix it.  Hard to say how those sides will come down in the states that matter.

* Immigration reform.  Also a Supreme Court issue.  Pretty important in many of the battleground states even some not on the border. Also as a 10th amendment issue.  Not likely that Obabma will gain support where it matters but uncertain how much it will hurt.

* The economy - LOTS can happen between now and then.   Neither Obama or the GOP will allow the government to do anything to help.  They both want to use ""blame the other party"" as their campaign strategy.  Obama will get the credit or blame depending on how the economy (and specifically jobs) shake out over the next 11 months.  Too much job growth could actually hurt Obama - the GOP ads will say ""Obama tried to scare you to spend lots of money and create/fund lots of new government programs to create jobs.  He said 'pass this bill NOW' 100s of times.  But we knew that the bill wasn't needed.  He was wrong on the stimulus (we went over 8% unemployment) and wrong on the jobs bill.  Why would you want to leave him in charge when he doesn't know what he's doing on jobs?""

* Wars - likely to have some effect in a few battleground states.  Does Iraq go smooth or not after the ""withdrawl""?  How does Afghanistan go in 2012?  What's Iran going to do in 2012?  Obama may still be able to ride on Osama, Gaddafi, and Iraq ""withdrawl"".  Or a few other things could make us forget those and Obama look week &amp; inept.",1

As distasteful as it may be, sometimes you do have to choose between the lesser of two evils. 

I just hope next time, like when we need to address the debt ceiling, that they do not let it get to the last second forcing Obama and the democrats to make big, unnecessary concessions to avoid catastrophe. 

Rather I hope he is out there every single day, using his bully pulpit, to repeat the exact same message. We need to raise tax revenues on the wealthiest back to historical norms before we even consider cutting important social programs. Maybe if he does that, he can expose the republican's true objectives and get the majority of American people to stand behind him and what is right for the country. /soapbox

"Wow, what an insight. What is the correct way to show sarcasm on the 'net? Yes, it should be blatantly obvious to anyone that the game is rigged. To me it's been obvious since the 2000 (s)election of George W. Bush. 1984 was a brilliant novel, but Orwell got it wrong. The state didn't have to install TVs everywhere - people willingly purchased them and proceeded to watch them non-stop for ""news,"" so much so that a complete joke of a human being such as Dubya was represented to enough of the populace as credible that he got to be president. Yes, there was illegal activity going on with regards to vote tampering, etc. but the real farce was that enough morons believed he was a legit choice that the numbers weren't that far off. 

What I foresaw in the 2008 election was Obama winning (no grass roots campaign BTW), keeping the military adventures going - expanding them in fact - and the so-called conservatives would howl like wolves about all the evil, bad things he is doing (socialism, anyone?), paving the way for another ""Republican"" president in 2012. And, true to form, my liberal friends send me articles on how mean the right is being to Obama, while I patiently explain to them that in his campaign speeches he was telling us exactly what he would do as president regarding ""the war on terror,"" he's doing exactly that (drone missile strikes, more troops in Afghanistan, etc.)  and why is that now OK when it *wasn't* OK when Dubya was doing it?

I don't agree 100% with Naomi Klein, but The Shock Doctrine is probably the best intro to how this works; what's happening ever increasingly in the US has been tested many, many times around the world. And, if you understand Spanish, try listening to Fidel Castro's speeches from the early 1960s.

No, that was an insurance company bailout. People wanted greater coverage, but without decreasing costs, there was no way insurance companies could address this issue.

Things like bank/auto bailouts and Obamacare are not free.  Government doesn't produce any wealth.  Government can only spend the money of people who do create wealth.  So when the government blows trillions of dollars on deals that keep their precious UAW in tact, or help their buddies in the financial industry, someone has to pay for that.  When Obama suddenly creates a new entitlement system like Obamacare, someone has to pay for that.

There are some very large corporations sitting on huge stockpiles of cash right now because every time you turn on a television, the democrats are spouting off on a new plan to ""tax the rich"" or to make corporations ""pay their fair share.""

With the passage of the Patriot Act, the government has become more bold in modifying law to allow information already being collected to be used to in criminal cases.   However, real criminals (drug smugglers) and terrorists are a wily bunch and quickly modify or adapt their modus of operation.  Proof of this is our success in stemming drug trafficking, finding bin laden, finding other terrorist, etc.  Government's answer is always more laws.

"Thanks for giving me an opportunity to do the kind of research I enjoy on a rainy day off from work... According to the 24 October, 1791 Census recorded by then-Secretary of State, T. Jefferson, there were officially 3,680,289 persons living in the United states (not included in the count- native Americans; slaves, however, were included). Last census taken in July, 2009 counted 307,006,550. When the Constitution was ratified in 1789 and thereafter up to the date of the first official Census of the United States, there was only 1.2% of today's population subject to a virtually un-amended Constitution. The economy was mostly agrarian with the very beginning of industrial development germinating in the northern states. Communication between two people living in two states took at least one hard day's ride by horse and sometimes as long as a month in Winter.

I disagree with you: interpretation of what the founding fathers believed then in the context of the America of today IS guesswork. What on earth would Benjamin Franklin, who took a week to hand-set the plates on his press to print Poor Richard's Almanac think of today's level of information exchange? He might very well have worried that such technology might be applied to thought control and the usurpation of individual liberties and privacy - but that would be mere speculation, because ol' Ben is still mouldering in his grave and can't speak for himself presently. And that's but only one of the myriad issues that the ""Founding Fathers"" never had to confront- let alone imagine - in their times.

And insofar as your very telling comment about Ms. Pelosi's remark about ""Obamacare""is concerned, Nancy Pelosi is no more a liberal than is John Baynor - just two genders of the same mongrel barking in the same pound.  She was undoubtedly in the same closed-door briefing room when the Senate Intelligence Committee heard Bush, Rumsfeld and Cheney present their arguments for ""enhanced interrogation"" in 2002, thereby officially creating public policy in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions to which the United States was a signatory... also in direct violation of the Constitution if one considers the integrity of the Office of the Presidency to be important as outlined in Section 2.2 that grants that office powers to enter into treaties (by strict interpretation, nothing in the Constitution specifies how and under what circumstances treaties are to be broken...).

And Bush made the right call, since he knew you couldn't get them tried in the US.

&gt; It's like if your dad wants to go out to eat and your mom wants to stay home and eat, so she fails to pay for gas in the car so nobody can go anywhere. Did your dad get everybody to eat out? No. But it's not his fault that you're eating at home.

But it Mom said the car is already out of gas, it is Dad's fault.  Bush didn't empty the gas tank.

Here's a better analogy:

If Bush and Obama are driving to a party, and Bush is driving down the Interstate, and Obama takes over and says no, let's go down Central, and Bush tells him there's construction on Central and he can't go that way, and Obama goes anyway and runs into construction and then has to loop around and take the Interstate, and they arrive at the party two hours late, it's not the fault of the people doing construction; it's the fault of Obama for not listening to the facts.

"Whoa now, I never said I *approved* of anything.  All I said is that it was smart politics which I think you'll agree that it was.

I also *never* said that Obama was exceptionally open.  My concern is that you're trying to lump political manuevering in with genuine executive secrets in order to give support to your characterization of Obama as an exceptionally secretive president.  That's simply not something you should do regardless of how open the president actually is.  Like I said, it makes you seem desperate.  It robs your legitimate concerns of apparent credibility.

I'm not playing the part of an apologist of anyone.  I'm trying to do you a favor, because anyone who actually *is* exceptionally partial to the president is going ignore every word you have to say when you tell them that you think Obama is secretive in part because he took too long to release his birth certificate for your liking.

Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups are still ensconced and burgeoning in Pakistan.

My problem with this entire emetic campaign is Obama has been heavily focused on Afghanistan when the focus should have been on Pakistan. We should have, from the very beginning, been cutting military funding to Pakistan, throwing more pressure on the venal Pakistani government, calling Pakistan out on their laughably blatant duplicitous game, somehow working for a detente between Pakistan and India, etc. ",2
"First of all, here's the unedited version of that video: http://onegoodmovemedia.org/movies/0712/ronpaul_evolution.mov

The one you linked has been edited maliciously to make it sound as damaging as possible.

He's just confused about abiogenesis vs. evolution of species by natural selection. For instance, in the Reddit interview, he says ""billions and billions of years of changes that have occurred, evolutionary changes, that have occurred."" He is a creationist, as far as believing God created the universe 14.whatever billion years ago, but he still believes evolution occurs.

Recently, he has cleared this up a bit. The following is from his latest book *Liberty Defined*, page 104:

&gt;No one person has perfect knowledge as to man's emergence on this earth...The creationists frown on the evolutionists, and the evolutionists dismiss the creationists as kooky and unscientific. Lost in this struggle are those who look objectively at all the scientific evidence for evolution without feeling any need to reject the notion of an all-powerful, all-knowing Creator. **My personal view is that recognizing the validity of an evolutionary process does not support atheism nor should it diminish one's view about God and the universe**.

I.e. he believes in both divine creation and the process of evolution.

This same stance will be held by Obama or almost any other politician. Most have all been theists (at least publicly), which usually entails believing in God creating the universe (or at least saying they believe this).",1

"Taxes are not mandatory, neither is buying a house.

What we are talking about here, is forcing EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN to purchase health insurance, no matter what.  That costs about $200/month per person on average.  Where does this money come from?  Especially in this economy?

You might think they're the same, but they are not.  You are forced to buy health insurance, no matter who you are.  Just for existing, you owe somebody $200/month.  I don't own a home, so I don't pay a mortgage.  I know many people who have no job, so they pay no taxes.  But, pretty soon, people will have to choose between paying their electric bill or health insurance.  Rent, or insurance.  Child support, or insurance.  And guess what, the government has made that decision for them, so tough shit.  Starve, be homeless, go to jail for not being able to afford child support...doesn't matter.

Luckily, the supreme court just tore the health care bill to shreds, and the Obama administration is going to have to appeal it.  (here's a surprise - federal judges know the law better than Obama ever will, so maybe they're on to something here?)",-1
"First off, they aren't expense accounts. They are office budgets. They are subject to strict rules about how they can spend it. All of this from the Obama-Reid ethics bill passed a few years ago. These rules govern what they can buy, how they can travel and many other things. Please look into them and you will see that they are far more strict than rules that govern the private sector.

Their personal housing cannot be paid for by this budget. They must find their own lodging in DC and their home state and they must pay for it with their salary. Of course, if they are out of town and need a hotel, the office budget pays for it, just like every other job. Same with food. Reps cannot go out and go grocery shopping with their office budget. That is a breach of ethics and it is illegal. If you have specific evidence to say that this is widespread I invite you to provide it. Otherwise, I will not accept, ""they are all crooks"" as the reason that they will breach these ethics rules. That is circular logic and it is not sufficient for debate.

If nothing else, explain why Joe Biden had a [net worth](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/24/AR2007032400305_pf.html) less than $150,000 when he was in the Senate? Of course many of these people have other forms of income (or rather their family does) and that skews things.

Also, you clearly have no clue what the hell you are talking about in terms of pay raises. Congress' pay is set to raise every year in accordance with the Cost of Living Adjustment. Unless they block it from happening. Which they did, both last year and this year.

So they actually prevented their pay from going up the last few years. In fact, since this whole system of COLA increases started, they have blocked their own raises 7 out of 13 [times](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/97971-obama-signs-law-blocking-congress-pay-raise). But yeah, your absurd notions based on what seems to be baseless accusations sounds a lot better because it makes people angrier.

Look, is the system perfect? No. But look at it this way:

Each Congressperson must (with very very few state exceptions) maintain two places of residence. You know, to avoid staying in hotels every night they are in DC (which is most). One of those places has to be in one of the most expensive cities in the country. I know for a fact that several of them get one room in shared houses with their decadent salaries. So yeah, they get more than the average American, but the average American doesn't have to have 2 houses as a condition of their employment and does not have to live in an expensive city.

Even if we did limit their salaries heavily, what would that do? Would John Kerry not run? Of course he would! He has millions of dollars in his family. Would a poorer individual like Biden ever run? Of course not. He cannot volunteer for a job like this. He would not have any money.

So, if your goal is to make politics the realm of the wealthy to a greater extent than it already is, please keep insisting on your opinions that they have too much money.",2

At this point I don't see many options left to the US government. We just have to wait it out. The last realistic possibility given the Republican House would be more tax cuts.

"&gt; Its equal and its constant

Coming from all sides? Agree on that. Disagree on the rest. 

Equal implies equal influence. If you turn on a major media outlet (e.g. cnn, fox, wsj, not small/niche stuff.) it's much easier to find these extreme arguments from the right, and the arguments stick around much longer. To me that's key metric to measure impact - extreme arguments that are both (1) pervasive in major media and (2) sticky.

As of 2010 18% of us citizens thought obama is a muslim - http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1701/poll-obama-muslim-christian-church-out-of-politics-political-leaders-religious. He's not. Extrapolated that's 55 million. As of 2011 31% of republicans think he's muslim http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41248.html. This extreme argument, lacking any solid evidence, has been piped into major outlets for years. Same for the Birther stuff up until recently.

Contrast this to hoffa's statement. It's extreme? Check. But it won't be a talking point in a few weeks. It won't stick like the Birther or Muslim arguments.

The problem is that we didn't change things. Not really anyways, other than the symbolic victory of electing the first black president. All this shows is that the younger demographics are just as susceptible to manipulation as any other demographic. You can do all the research in the world but if a candidate says he is going to do one thing while he's campaigning and does something completely different after he's elected, it won't make a bit of difference. The true problem lies in the two party system itself. No amount of grassroots mobilization will make a bit of difference if we continue to operate in a two party paradigm.

"I'm still unsure if you're formally trained in the law or not? 

I'm hazarding a guess of ""no"" at this point - those two laws only appear superficially to resemble the current Mandate, but to the trained eye they're both inherently (and extremely) different. 

* 1) Second Militia Act of 1792 - this act *did* have a mandate - it required that certain people to purchase various war-related equipment. However, the key difference here was that it first *conscripted* people, and then only required the conscripts to purchase the gear. This law did not require *civilians* to engage in commerce, it required *soldiers* to do so. The government has always had the power to order its soldiers to do whatever it likes. Whether the federal government can order its *soldiers* to engage in commerce, and whether the federal government can order its *citizens* to engage in commerce are two entirely different legal questions - so different that one does not effect the other in any way. 

* 2) An Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen (1798) - This act was not a mandate. Its only relevance to the modern law is that it appears, again, only superficially, to create a government-run health insurance program. First, it did *not* do so. It was actually a *tax* which the government then used to pay for seamen's health care. This is a critical legal difference. Further, the Obama administration has explicitly stated that the mandate is *not* a tax, further separating the two laws. Next, the current mandate is not the government creation of a health-insurance program to begin with, it's merely the requirement to purchase private insurance. Lastly, this law again deals with military members who are under increased control by the government as opposed to civilians. ",1

Obama is a progressive.  You can't just disqualify Obamacare out of hand like that - it enacts universal health care.  It is similar to the Swiss model (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Switzerland).

They have already noted several items, most notably the business expensing rule over $500, is quite overburdensome and is being rejected by the public.  They are looking to do something about that.

Actually what is supported by the American public are the ideas of: pre-existing conditions being able to be covered, an end to dropping people when they need care, an end to insurance companies screwing their customers or interfering with their care, expanded child care coverage, and more affordable care which we are still waiting to see if itll have that affect since they did nothing to address the actual costs of medical care.  Thats about all the public approves of.  The 2000+ pages covers a bit more than that.

I'm sorry, this is not a major issue. It a rather obscure government procedure that for decades has been a due course of action in government - just one of the things done to keep things rolling. 

The only reason you even know what the hell it is, is because republicans have, in their insane desperation to have SOMETHING to hang on this President - decided to make it into an issue, by bold-faced lying about what extending it would do (really: nothing). 

Deficits are caused by either overspending or not taking enough in. However, our deficits and debt have been mostly the problem of the former President, G.W. Bush. We know this. He created over 5 TRILLION dollars in new spending in 8 years. The 1.7 trillion spent on the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are nearly equal to all the spending Obama has added, including the 700 billion dollar Stimulus Package. The Bush tax cut has cost us 1.8 trillon over the, what, 6-8 years it existed? 

(Source: http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/07/24/opinion/sunday/24editorial_graph2/24editorial_graph2-popup.gif from the NY Times)

"To answer your first question, there is enough wealth in the state of California to meet the deficit and then some. California's projected deficit for 2011, assuming that no new taxes are levied, is $26 billion. So that's about half the wealth of one man, Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle and California's richest resident. Mr Ellison could meet the entire shortfall, paying for the $2 billion to be slashed from MediCal, the $800 million cut from mental health services, the half billion removed from assistance for the developmentally disabled, the $2 billion to be cut from K-12, and the $1.3 billion being taken away from UC and CS public colleges. After his wealth had paid for all that, he'd still be one of the richest men on Earth. So, I think that puts the deficit into some perspective. 

As for your point: ""If you make ten times what I make, why should I expect you to pay more than ten times what I pay?"" - that is an argument against the current federal and state income taxes. If there was a 5 percent flat rate of income tax in California, then someone earning $1 million a year would pay ten times more than some earning $100,000. As California has a progressive tax rate then, of course, the millionaire would pay more than the guy earning 100 grand. Are you in favor of introducing a flat rate? Or of getting rid of income tax altogether? If so, I must respectfully disagree with you. 

As for the ""shovel ready jobs"" of Obama, I agree with you that the idea that the stimulus was a scheme to create jobs is a fraud. Most of the $800 billion stimulus passed in 2009 was used to either plug a hole in state and local finances for a few months or to give tax breaks to businesses. Very little was actually spent on job creation. In fact, Obama has repeatedly said that he opposes a program of government public works projects and that he believes it is only the private sector that can create jobs. This despite the fact that the private sector has created net 0 jobs over the past decade!",1

This kind of matter addressing currently (such as the torture, Guantanamo Bay et cetera) is rather corrupted leadership than to be any kind of problem solving. Now I'm not talking about Ron Paul suggesting; I mean current practices such as with waterboarding.

That is because instead of looking at action - reaction patterns (ALSO considering time span), one tries to defeat these patterns by overruling. Such as if your kid cries, just slap him/her until she doesn't.

Or: naming the results of problems the initial problems (still, these are results) thereby most probably neglecting causes. Bad leadership.

A little more understandable. What is the cause for such irregular behavior that would demand such harsh actions in the first place? Because most of these corrupted leaders refuse to address these facts for complication or whatnot reasons, while doing so they rather add up to current problematic circumstances by their rigorous drastic actions solving these results instead of solving problems; rather neglecting causes, originating problems. Most definitely with escalating effects.

Ron Paul shouldn't suggest this (nevertheless, I understand he needs to be careful and at least he's addressing the matter) though rather put it as a fact. Such as waterboarding is CLEARLY torture, and most of Americans apparently DON'T have a clue how the world rejects it ALREADY. 

Would you take a police officer seriously when you noticed the officer neglecting his own laws? Can that officer expect to be taken seriously, over time? Exactly this small scale example describes what happens on global scales now (condoned and practiced, for some part even 'induced', by America). 

America is talking about being democratic, freedom, yet increasingly proving otherwise. Obama has FAR FROM addressed the matter as he promised, as he should. Partly due to much of corrupt leadership from conservative corners. Breaking promises (otherwise than for democratically necessary concessional reasons) is a VERY bad thing to do for any leader. 

Bad leadership, people, at least Ron Paul is a person that appears to be honest and IS addressing matters. America WILL need good, correct and honest leadership working according to public interest again BEFORE America can EVER get to solving problems, really.

Now, whatever you might think/believe, I'm not even favoring his campaign or anyhow; just addressing facts. Personally, I think we need MUCH more good leaders than just one good guy as president before we even get close. We need to stop letting us be informed blindly and start informing ourselves about our votes. So we get to this GOOD leadership. From there the sky is the limit again, as America once was clearly.

I did found some information regarding R. Paul and his views, if you'd like to know about it: http://www.cfr.org/experts/world/ron-paul/b13303

Greetings and you Americans, good luck with upcoming elections and everything you need it on.

"Barry, you're problem is not what is right of you, but what is wrong within you.

Did you know:

The truth about the JFK assassination is public domain if you are interested. Bill Cooper does an excellent job of covering it in his book Behold, a Pale Horse and you can listen to him read it here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jfnQDgNX2E

Part of the broader story of JFK was the effort he was making behind the scenes to follow through on USA's promises of backing worldwide economic development in the post-WW2 environment that was scrapped in favor of the Cold War. An important aspect of this was his relationship with President Sukarno of Indonesia because the Japanese had left immense amounts of gold buried there and those assets were going to be central to the new currency issued and backed by precious metals. Executive Order 11110 was one of the first steps towards bringing this plan to fruition. Interestingly, Lolo Soetoro, Obama's step-father, was a high ranking officer in the CIA backed guerrilla army to overthrow President Sukarno. So, now you know: Obama's family has a long history of undermining the Democratic party.

Biden himself draws parallels between his 1995 bill and its 2001 cousin. ""I drafted a terrorism bill after the Oklahoma City bombing. And the bill John Ashcroft sent up was my bill,"" he said when the Patriot Act was being debated, according to the New Republic, which described him as ""the Democratic Party's de facto spokesman on the war against terrorism.""

http://killfile.newsvine.com/_news/2008/08/25/1783040-in-1995-joe-biden-basically-wrote-the-patriot-act

And that Obama has a three generation history in the CIA? His white grandparents worked for the OSS before it turned into the CIA so actually his family was CIA before there was a CIA. His mother, father, and step-father were CIA too:

Minor v Happersett is well known Supreme Court precedent. It establishes Obama's place of birth as irrelevant, which shows that the media engaging in the whole stupid birther charade is nothing more than petty distraction for low grade morons.

That's because there is much more interesting background information on Obama. He is an admirer and close associate of Brzezinski by his own admissions. This is the man that ran the Islamic radicalization program on behalf of the CIA in 1980s Afghanistan:

As to the Osama raid earlier this year, we know that the only helicopter that landed blew up on take off so that the extraction of Osama's body was physically impossible:

And the SEALs in the other helicopters (who were not part of the raid in the sense that their helicopters did not land and they didn't disembark to hit the compound) were murdered shortly thereafter as a result of widespread leaking that the raid was a fraud:

http://spitfirelist.com/news/barack-obama-the-wizard-of-oz/

Talat Othman. Tim Osman.

Do you wonder why this is?

Well, we know Obama is a big fan of al-Qaeda:

Obama has so many selling points, he should be able to get all the Bush supporters on his side:

1) His support of al-Qaeda rebels in Libya:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8861608/Libya-Al-Qaeda-flag-flown-above-Benghazi-courthouse.html

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQec6A2Al7o

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20111208/ml-syria/

(3) His launching of a war with Iran:

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/iran-military-shoots-down-us-drone

which includes a shutting down of the central bank and is likely to lead to $10+ gallons of gas in the near future:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15997065

(4) His incitement of the Russian bear leading us to the brink of nuclear war:

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/world/europe/putin-accuses-clinton-of-instigating-russian-protests.html

http://rt.com/news/fox-moscow-fake-riots-281/

http://www.pakalertpress.com/2011/12/07/china%E2%80%99s-president-hu-urges-navy-to-prepare-for-combat/

According to his own book, he worked for Business International Corp, a known CIA front, and traveled to Pakistan in 1981 when they were designated a state sponsor of terror which would only be possible with intelligence agency authorization. So, in addition to knowing that Obama's white grandparents, mother, father, and step-father were CIA from the above links, it is safe to conclude that Obama is CIA too.

One interesting thing to note about Obama's mother is that she spoke Arabic (among many other languages) according to Dr. Pieczenik. We also know that Obama spent many years in Indonesia as a child, which is the best time to adopt cultural mores and language. Combine this with our knowledge in hand that Obama did something as a covert agent and that it happened in the Af-Pak theater at least in part.

And 9/11 was obviously an inside job:

The FBI and CAJI and pretty much everyone else that doesn't live under a rock:

So now we're just about ready to truly identify who the President really is:

Luke 10:18

He replied, ""I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.""

Hebrew: Baraq

""flash of lightning,"" an Isr. leader

Greek: Barak

Barak = ""lightning""

   1. a commander of the Israelites

Aramaic: B'aRQaA

Meaning: lightning

According to the tradition, Imam Ali Ibn Abi-Talib (the prophet's cousin and son-in-law) prophesied that at the End of Times and just before the return of the Mahdi, the Ultimate Saviour, a ""tall black man will assume the reins of government in the West."" Commanding ""the strongest army on earth,"" the new ruler in the West will carry ""a clear sign"" from the third imam, whose name was Hussein Ibn Ali. The tradition concludes: ""Shiites should have no doubt that he is with us.""

Last global financial crisis was 666 years ago when King Edward III repudiated his debts and triggered a systemic collapse, kind of like today.

9-11-11 Obama pauses before saying ""Be still and know that I am God."" Pslam 46 was read by Obama at the 9-11-11 ritual.

Pslam 46 is the 666th chapter from the end of the King James Bible. The original King James Bible from 1611 has Psalm 46 printed on page 666.

"The problem with liberals is that as soon as they get what they want (complete control at a federal level) they'll essentially switch ideologies. If you look at history the term 'conservative' and 'liberal' have changed over time. As time goes on more of them will realize the danger that comes with having a monolithic, centralized authority, and most likely turn against it, but by then it will be too late.

Liberals in their current form serve one purpose, to tear down the institutions of society, then when revolution does come, they will be purged for being potential counter-revolutionaries. They will be killed because once the regime they praise does come, it will eliminate any potential competition for its own monopoly on power. Just because the dictator is Barack Obama now doesn't mean we wont elect Hitler 2.0 one day to use the system you want to create against you.

Liberals and the ""99%"" claim they're against corporations having power but fail to see that the ones they want to bestow all power in, the government, is its self a corporation. A monolithic, centralized corporation with a monopoly on power and what ever you give them power to control. And then they start railing against banks for becomeing too big. 

&gt;""Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.”

"I'm sorry but Greenwald is off on that one. I like him, but he can be a little unhinged. You can criticize Obama for being too married to bi-partisanship or for conceding too much ground instead of fighting, but the proposals you mention, including agreeing to form the catfood commission were all attempts to negotiate with the GOP, who had no intention of keeping the talks in good faith. He has never once proposed gutting Medicare or SS simply for the sake of ideology (or even in any way that would hold him to the cuts in the end anyway). The man is shrewd, I will definitely give him that.

Obama has tried, to his detriment or his credit, to give the Republicans every opportunity to help clean up their own mess. Despite near unanimous opposition from day one, he's even gotten a lot accomplished. If he hangs on through the election (and I believe he will) then things will likely be a lot different. Without re-election to consider, I have a good feeling that the shrewdness will become even more ruthless.

Edit: I should add that running to the right of the GOP in the debt ceiling debate actually wasn't so dumb. Knowing the GOP would walk away until the very last second, why not propose thing you know are popular with the Republican base, only to have the GOP itself disavow their own proposal? Even more ammunition for the ""see, these people are not serious"" argument (which seems to be emerging as a campaign theme, btw.",1
"Well that makes sense because 73% of people are probably pretty stupid.

&gt; [But the president’s plan also has several unintended consequences](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/your-money/taxes/buffett-rule-is-more-complicated-than-politics-suggest.html) for people who make far less than $1 million a year. Interest on municipal bonds, for instance, is now tax-free. Under the president’s proposal, only taxpayers who pay an income tax rate of 28 percent or less would continue to get the tax exemption. Limiting the deduction would surely raise the cost of borrowing for municipalities, a cost that would presumably be passed on to city and state taxpayers. It might also limit the number of people interested in municipal bonds. Chris Ryon, managing director at Thornburg Investment Management, which manages $6.7 billion in municipal bonds, said he took consolation in knowing that owners of municipal bonds were split fairly evenly between people who made more than $200,000 — the cutoff for higher taxes — and those who made less. But given how poorly the municipal bond market has performed recently, he said, Mr. Obama’s plan only added “more uncertainty to a market that doesn’t need it.” ",-8

"This is just pandering to the very same slactivists who think that they're ""taking a stand"" by doing such things as signing these online petitions, and taking the very bold step of ""changing their facebook status"".  

You know why people are up in arms?  Because Obama didn't give them the answer they were looking for when it comes to marijuana.  What they fail to realize is that the WH promised ""a response"".  They're just pissed because they didn't get the response they wanted.  

And quite frankly, I'm glad they didn't.  Not because I'm against marijuana (I support legalization, for the record, though I don't smoke weed), but because I'd rather my government focus on important issues, rather than further pander to a bunch of slactivists that sign petitions representing .008% of the population.

As others have said, if Obama started taking these petitions seriously, we wouldn't just have the nutjobs starting petitions to acknowledge the existence of aliens and that Elvis is living on Jupiter, but we'd also have groups with some serious political backing petitioning just as hard to keep marijuana illegal, repeal DADT, ban abortions, etc.  

If these petitions started being taken seriously, I **guarantee** you that for every 25k petition you come up with favoring legalization, a group with real political power will come up with a 75k one petitioning to keep it illegal.  We'll have religious groups coming up with petitions far, FAR larger than 25k signatures advocating banning gay marriage and abortions.  Etc. etc. etc.  

Be careful what you wish for, guys.  You might get it.

tl;dr version:  **they don't take these things seriously.  They won't take these things seriously.  And quite frankly, it's better that way.**

"I think you will find a difference between the GOP rhetoric displayed in this article and Obama's response to a question about it in 2009:

""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism. I'm enormously proud of my country and its role and history in the world. If you think about the site of this summit and what it means, I don't think America should be embarrassed to see evidence of the sacrifices of our troops, the enormous amount of resources that were put into Europe postwar, and our leadership in crafting an Alliance that ultimately led to the unification of Europe. We should take great pride in that.

And if you think of our current situation, the United States remains the largest economy in the world. We have unmatched military capability. And I think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality, that, though imperfect, are exceptional.

Now, the fact that I am very proud of my country and I think that we've got a whole lot to offer the world does not lessen my interest in recognizing the value and wonderful qualities of other countries, or recognizing that we're not always going to be right, or that other people may have good ideas, or that in order for us to work collectively, all parties have to compromise and that includes us.
And so I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships because we create partnerships because we can't solve these problems alone.""",6

&gt;The Obama administration would like to keep about 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq beyond the end of this year but has not begun formal discussions with the Iraqis about the size or makeup of the force, U.S. officials said.

That doesn't demonstrate at all what you said, which is that Obama violated the withdrawal agreement with Iraq. The fact is the US is waiting on the Iraqi's, not the other way around. Critical thinking skills indeed. 

&gt;The Obama administration is expected to appeal as soon as Wednesday a federal judge's ruling that halted the Defense Department from enforcing its policy that bars openly gay people from military service, according to senior administration officials familiar with the government's plans.

Obama's record on LGBT issues is pretty much impeccable, see my other reply. The reason the Obama administration appealed this case was that they wanted to implement the repeal in a more structured fashion, they didn't want it to happen overnight and be disruptive to the troops. I know you're not going to buy that explanation but especially in hindsight it looks perfectly legitimate to me. In the end the way DADT was repealed, pushed through Congress, ensures that a President Perry or whoever will never be able to undo it. 

&gt;In 17 months in office, President Obama has already outdone every previous president in pursuing leak prosecutions. His administration has taken actions that might have provoked sharp political criticism for his predecessor, George W. Bush, who was often in public fights with the press.

I still maintain some skepticism as the only evidence we have is this reporter saying that it is so, he provides no evidence, no way to confirm or deny if that's true.

"&gt;Progressives would actually push for someone like Kucinich to run again at the same pace as those who support Ron Paul

I love Kucinich! He would be a great candidate.

If a Ron Paul candidacy goes really far (like he wins the GOP primaries), then he sets a shining example to all non-traditional politicians like Kucinich, Gary Johnson, or Ralph Nader. Ron Paul success would prove that you don't have to bow down to crony party politics in order to have an impact.

&gt;I agree that big government is a double edged sword, but it shouldn't be completely dismantled.

Totally. I believe in the potential of government to be a positive force in our lives. However, I also believe it is healthy to have some politicians around that constantly challenges the extent of federal power.

In theory, the Republicans are suppose to be the ""small government"" party. But in reality they are also ""big government""--the only difference they have with the Democrats is that they disagree on which part of the government should be the biggest.

That's why I support Ron Paul--at least through the GOP primaries. He has no chance of beating Obama, but I think a Paul-Obama general election would force Obama to answer some tough questions about the war in the middle east, civil rights, war on drugs, war on terror, and our monetary policy.

They fought tooth and nail for the bare minimum of what they could get.

There has never been any other time in American history that we had a depression for so long as with FDR. I'm sure that it's completely unrelated.

That being said, I'm disappointed that he didn't pick this promise in particular to keep.

Of course if its easier to believe is a corporate stooge (which to some extent, being a moderate, he probably is), or that he is a reptilian, or that he betrayed your sacred liberal values because he isn't doing his job in the exact manner you want (a little bit unrealistic), then that is fine.

It's a way for the group to rationalize why occupying and protesting-for-the-right-to-protest is a better use of time than canvassing and establishing a more uniform, organized political movement. 

If people have the energy to spend months camped out in parks, they have the energy to get out and mobilize a genuine political campaign. Some people are already doing it, but it doesn't seem like that is the current thrust of OWS. 

At the very least, you could be trying, and if normal democratic means were ""oppressed"" then you would have a convincing argument to get more people on the side of occupying-as-policy. Instead, what looks like is going to happen is that the election will come and go with little input or influence from the OWS crowd who stood on the sidelines harumphing with their arms folded, while the neo-Tea Party has another electoral tailgate party in front of congress in November.

Obama turned conservatives because conservatives threatened to vote him out. That is the only incentive politicians respond to. That is the only threat that has utility in invoking. As long as OWS refuses to wield that threat, they will remain politically harmless. ",1

"1.See, the problem with so many people is that they decide it's more productive to bash Ron Paul instead of speaking out in favor of any other candidate.

I don't really try to ""bash"" him as much as point out that he is NOT the ideal candidate some people think he is. I think the ""hive mind"" you are referring to here is just as readily reflected by the Paul supporters on this site. Folks hear ""Legalize pot"" and ""end the wars"" and stop listening after that. My distaste for Mr. Paul goes deeper than that. His libertarian view of a weak, ineffectual federal government flies in the face of basic common sense. I could go off on a whole different tangent about the importance of strong government and well regulated markets, but I'll save that for another rant.
 
2.""..because a man is religious does not mean he's a bad person..""

Maybe not a bad person, but definately lacking in cognative reasoning ability. If you look at the republican field, there is nothing but religious zealotry at every turn. Now, I understand that in this country, you gotta profess a love for Jesus or you aint getting elected, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. One reason I voted for Obama was that he was very obviously a christian for political purposes only, and if he isn't just faking it for his career, at least he's not wearing it on his sleeve and using it for votes. That lack of aggresive christianity is the very reason why the right has been so successful in labeling him a muslim. Alll that said, though, I find it very hard to support anybody that believes in devils and angels. Just can't do it.
 
3.""And please stop using creationist and extremist and bat-shit-insane, because these are all just words, and without an explanation, they are making you look like the one that's blinded.""

Of these three labels, the only one I would be inclined to stop using would be bat-shit-insane, simply because thats a personal opinon, and doesn't contribute to the discussion. The other two, however, do apply to this candidate. He is most certainly a creationist, he has stated that himself on numerous occasions. He thinks the world was created by the christian god in 6 days, so by his own admission, that label applies. I will also say he is an extremist. He has called for a return to the gold standard, an economic impossibility in a global market. Cannot be done, and even a small amount of rational thought given to the idea reveals this quite readily. He obviously hasn't done that, or he wouldn't be advocating for it. Ending essentially all federal agencies, the EPA, the FDA,the NHTSA, all of those and more. Absolute, unadulterated insanity! Can you even BEGIN to imagine a country where it is left to ""the invisible hand of the free market"" to determine things like food and worker safety, industrial waste standards in drinking water, minimum off time for pilots and truckers, etc..? That list could go on for ever! He would do away with ALL of that. It's unthinkable. And the idea that those decisions could then be left up to the states is laughable. Under such a system, all interstate trade would come to a halt. You wouldn't be able to move goods from one state to another: Texas says peanutbutter has to be tested for salmonella, but oklahoma says it doesnt have to, so no oklahoma peanut butter could be sold in texas, for example. EVERYTHING would be like that. You think dealing with one federal agency for national standards stifles growth? Just try and picture 50 different agencies trying to regulate things. Pure chaos! It makes no sense, and again, if Paul supporters stopped and gave these ideas a good, long think they would come to the same concluson. Logic and rational thought applied to such ideas does not bear them out, and they can therefore be labled ""Extremist"". Sticking to your guns when all the facts are against you is illogical. I cannot support an illogical candidate.

Yeah, he's got a good position on corporate influence, but so does Buddy Rhomer. You don't hear people talking about Buddy too much on here. I like Buddy, but I can't vote for him because of his position on one issue. He needs a bit more substance. 

There are a couple positions of Ron's I like, but overall, he is an extremist, and both impractical and illogical in his politics and economics. I cannot support such a man.

The true shame is we only get two choices.

Most people seem to simply want to have a reason to critique Obama's performance while ignoring the active stance the Right wing has taken to undermine his performance at every turn at the cost of the American taxpayer, regardless of political affiliation(that is, of course, unless you're rich); this was best shown by Mitch McConnell's statement of the GOP's goal to be simply to make Obama a one term president. While people critique the fact that he hasn't forced legislation through via legal manipulation, the very people critiquing him in this manner are parties who seem to lean against supporting him based on petty reasons, and speak of ""letdowns"" when they didn't even vote against a party back in Bush's second term, and opted out for poor reasons instead. I don't like everything Obama has done, but considering that the constituency that he has to deal with in 2012 to vote him in to even attempt to accomplish anything(and that's in lieu of [the promises he has kept](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/) further, he has to bargain with the shitstain on the American flag that is the GOP/Tea Party until the voters agree to have nothing to do with them. 

You can cry about Obama backing down and being ineffective, but if you're one of the chickenshit cowards who's newly ""independent"" in the face of the GOP/Tea Party showing their ass, and yet you still support them with marginalization statements about how ""both sides are bad!"", you have no right to critique Obama's performance when *you actively support people who undermine the things you are critiquing him for*.

Obama the trustworthy. /s,1
"Sure, I completely understand where you're coming from. Let me explain why RP has such ""bad policy"" ideas when it comes to DoE, Planned Parenthood, etc. etc.

RP comes from a political faction that believes there are deep, structural level problems from having a strong, centralized government (anti-Federalism). Therefore, they think the Constitution ought to be followed to the letter, and considered as a document that lists the things the Federal Government is allowed to do - everything else should be done at the State or local government level. 

Actually, I think as far as RP's personal opinion goes, he's probably even more radical than that:

http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/k8zph/did_anyone_else_see_ron_pauls_response_to_the/c2ifze3

but of course, he is a participant in this political structure (the State) that is a fact of life, that is supported and seen as legitimate by the vast majority of the population, so his personal belief in libertarianism is not very relevant - in his political activity, he follows the next best thing, which is anti-Federalism and a strict reading of the Constitution as a document that enumerates what the Federal government can do.

His position on abortion is actually indicative of how strongly he hews to these principles. Like it or not, he is a devout Christian who believes life believes at conception.  I guess as non-devout people we don't understand how people get to be that way, but I for one am convinced that people who hold this view are... completely sincere about it. Maybe his personal experience of seeing a late-term abortion. The point is, it is not easy for people who hold this view to offer to leave this question up to the States. In fact, the diametrically opposite position to the pro-choice pro-Roe-v-Wade position is that of Chuck Baldwin's - ban abortion at the federal level by defining life as beginning at conception by Constitutional amendment.

Anyhow. That is where Ron Paul is coming from, IMO.

Now, as to why I urge people to support Ron Paul in the Republican primary:

Most people follow a ""keep electing Democrats (or Republicans, if you're Conservative) and things will slowly keep getting better (or will get worse at a slower rate)"" voting strategy - which means in primaries they try to balance ideological purity (how liberal or conservative) with prospects of actually winning (but not too liberal or conservative) in the general election.

My thesis is that the game is rigged in such a way that such a voting strategy is completely ineffectual. And that this is why regardless of which party wins, and who gets to be in office, the big overall trends - wealth concentration at the hands of the rich, more and more power and influence for corporations, more powerful and intrusive government, larger and larger debt - stay pretty much the same. Either the election system is rigged, or the realities of power (the constraints on the president and congressmen) are such that it's simply not possible to turn this ship around from the inside - or most likely, probably a bit of both.

And this is why, even though Democrats won in 2006 and 2008, managed to get Obama into office, and meted out epic spankings to the Republicans, nothing much seems to have changed. We're still on the same course we were on with Bush &amp; Republicans in charge. Obama appears to be Bush III.

Then, how exactly is the game rigged? How do we go about ""breaking"" it and make it respond to the will of the people? Those are very complex questions and I don't have the desire to sit here and type a longish monograph, but I'll point out that:

#1. the worse the GOP gets, the worse the Democrats can be and get away with it. So helping the GOP become less crazy could actually be a way to make the Democratic party better. E.g. I'd guess that one reason why liberals go for candidates like Obama or Clinton rather than Kucinich is that Kucinich is just too radical - end the wars immediately and close all our foreign bases??? A guy saying this can never win, they think.

Helping a guy saying exactly this in the GOP primary could help guys like Kucinich seem more viable, next time around.

#2. If you analyze US politics in terms of competition and control by interest groups (which btw is the way CIA and State Dept. analysts analyze countries like USSR and North Korea - that is what they're doing when they look at some action that Kim Jong-Il took and say ""KJI did this because he had to placate the military"" etc.) the two most powerful groups, by far, are the National Security Establishment/Military Industrial Complex, and Big Finance/Wall Street. There is absolutely no way we can prevail against them with just half the people behind us, with just the Democratic party. So if we're to have any prospect of breaking their power over the country, someone like Ron Paul _has_ to win over the GOP demographic, to the side of anti-war, anti-Empire, and anti-Fed. Therefore it's a good idea to help him do as well as possible.

#3 GOP Establishment **hates** Ron Paul. They're pro-War, Imperialists, pro-screwing blacks w. the War on Drugs, in the employ of Wall Street Banksters (think of how they used to fellate Alan Greenspan during the Bush I, Clinton years) etc etc, how do you think they feel about Ron Paul? So they will certainly try to undermine his campaign. So helping it, fucks with the GOP establishment.

To sum up: I think the bad parts of RP's platform will not make the situation worse - those are all issues on which the GOP is already bad. So his effect will be to change some GOP voters opinions on foreign policy, war on drugs, etc. to the better. All the bad does is establish RP's street cred as one of them. You do not have to worry about what RP will do once in office because he will not win. The GOP establishment itself will make sure of that, and their power and influence is pretty significant. And you have nothing going on in the Democratic party primary anyhow. So I would say, the thing to do is fuck with the GOP during the primary stage - support Ron Paul. Then in the general election, vote whoever you think is best. Ron Paul will almost certainly not be one of the choices.

edit: the other thing that is really important about folks who speak the truth like RP, or Kucinich - Liberals/Democrats who consider the Democratic party trustworthy, and look to folks like Obama to figure out what is acceptable, they draw the line at totally the wrong places. For instance - bombing/blockading Iraq=A-okay, invading Iraq=not OK. This is the lie the Dem party pushed. In reality this is utter BS. What Clinton was doing was trying to regime change (i.e. conquer Iraq) by siege and starvation. What the Bushies and Neocons did was go ""hey c'mon, we've been besieging this place for 10 fucking years with no results - let's go to the next tool in the tool-box: Assault and invasion"". So there's simply not that much of a difference between the two camps - both are imperialists and warmongers. So someone like RP is extremely important to point to the right ""anti-war, anti-empire"" point of the compass. And to pummel insufficiently anti-war, anti-empire Liberals to see the light. Which is why I keep obnoxiously bringing up Ron Paul and insulting Obama supporters.

Yeah, I know it's rude and obnoxious. But if that's what takes you to go sufficiently radical when it comes to war, empire and murdering brown people - well, I view it practically as a duty. :D",1
"I didn't say he believed in it.  He's like a lot of Christians, he believes in a creator, but he doesn't know how it was done.

&gt;The GOP can't handle prosecuting Guantanamo prisoners, so let alone how they are going to handle the big guy Laden.

Who cares what the GOP has to say about this?  He authorized the killing of an American citizen and Osama bin Laden without trial.  These are horrible precedents despite the targets being unsavory people.

&gt;Obama did say ""[w]e believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states.""

This might be a newsflash to you, but Obama said precisely what AIPAC wanted him to;  the media likes to pretend there is this big divide between Obama and Israel, but they've been pretty lock step the whole way through.  This is purely a negotiating tactic.  Israel acts like it doesn't want to do '67 borders with land swaps, so when they finally do agree to it, it looks like a major concession.  Make no mistake about it, this is EXACTLY what Israel/AIPAC wants....They'll take the good land from the West Bank, and give the shit land in Israel where it's Arab population lives to the Palestinians.  In one move, they'll keep all the economically viable land, while cleansing their own country of its rather sizeable Arab population.

&gt;The globalists had direct and indirect ties to the Dunham family and in particular, Obama’s mother. Consider, for example, that Peter F.

In brief, Obama’s mother set up a large loan system in Indonesia akin to the savings and loan structure of the 1970s and 1980s. To gain a better understanding of her activities in finance, despite her background in anthropology, recall the BCCI scandal of the late 1970s. In fact, some of the same “players” who existed then continue to exist in Obama’s circles.

"Regulations take many forms. Let me quote what I posted somewhere else in this thread:

&gt;He [Paul] doesn't want zero regulations on corporations. That is a fallacy. Libertarians still believe in laws against fraud, like the banks committed on their investors. Those are things that would be enforced and prosecuted under a Paul presidency. He just doesn't believe in over-regulation, whereby many regulations in many industries were actually lobbied for by the corporations to give them an unfair competitive advantage against smaller competitors. There is a big difference in types of regulation, and they don't all fall into the same bucket. Not all of them are going to be canned under libertarian presidency, and many would (ideally) become stronger.

&gt;Right now we have those regulations on fraud, and they weren't prosecuted at all! Obama, and the ones like him, not libertarians, are the ones letting the bankers get away with murder! It isn't surprising when you see how many of his advisers come from the financial industry. The deregulation thing is absolutely a straw man argument.

Essentially I think you are right, but there is a very gross misunderstanding of deregulation. The Republicans take it to mean ""let corporations do absolutely anything,"" but Libertarians, through the principle of protection of property rights, believe in plenty of laws in what corporations can fairly do. The problem is good regulations are often ignored because of regulatory capture, and very very bad ones are put in place alongside them, which are ones that are actually enforced.",1

"I think one of the highlighted comments accurately sums up Obama's jobs bill: 

""The ""Jobs Bill"" was political theater -- a mishapen spawn birthed in order to be killed that Mr. Obama have a campaign issue in '12. He knew it would fail and the Senate Democrats were unenthusiastic. Mr. Obama has his campaign philosophy: ""What counts isn't who wins or loses -- it's who gets the blame."" 

The president had his chance in '09 with the near-trillion-dollar stimulus bill. It worked -- the Chinese economy was stimulated. His shovel ready projects? The shovels are still hanging on racks at Home Depot! Other ""jobs"" projects pushed through by Mr. Obama included a one-off $30 billion present to the Teachers' Union and an $8000 housing tax credit designed to ingratiate the president to real estate interests. In fact, his economic programs largely consist of loading a shotgun with thousand-dollar bills and firing it in the air in the hopes that someone, some way, will benefit. Problem is -- he's running out of ammo. 

Mr. Obama did not cause the Recession -- nor has he made it significantly worse. He doesn't have much to apologize for in this regard. The problem is that American labor is over-priced by world standards and Americans are ridiculously deep in debt: mortgage debt, student loan debt, credit card debt, etc., and it will take years to deleverage all this. 

So . . . we're not competetive as a nation and we are in hock up to our Reaganesque kysters. Mr. Obama didn't cause this, can't really solve it . . . but he does want to be reelected. Thus, our presidential economic program is basically: 

When in worry,
When in doubt --
Run in Circles,
Scream and shout! 

The president is screaming, shouting and running in circles. He is a nice, dignified man in a lousy spot. But, he has no real ideas and there may be no real solutions -- except time and patience. 

Killing this phony ""jobs bill"" was a favor to all of us. It is just more running in circles and screaming and shouting.""",48

http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm

It's at a pretty high level, though.  I found an *excellent* article breaking down in easy to understand terms why his gold standard position would basically finish the economy, but I can't find it right now.  I can walk you through the broad strokes if you like.

&gt; I don't agree with Ron Paul on various views, but you know what, a lot of them I do agree with, the big one being ending the wars and shutting down overseas bases.

Well that's fine -- now here's the difference between McCain, Obama and Paul -- both Obama and McCain presented plans to draw down the troops -- a set number per month for a set period of time, how this would be implemented, explanation of transitions and so forth.  Paul had, and still has, no plan whatsoever except tossing out platitudes like ""bring them home.""

Obama, meanwhile, is reducing 100,000 to 30,000 troops in Afghanistan and the Generals are saying they're coming home by 2014.  And in Iraq Obama has drawn down most of the troops (and all of the combat troops).

Paul has never presented any economic plan for review by the CBO (they do this for congressmen for free -- he just has to request it) nor any troop plan to the Joint Chiefs, nor the public.

What is happening in Mexico right now has a much larger impact on the American public then anything happening in between Israel and Palestine.

Total Casualties of the Israel-Palestine war (1948-2009) = 14,500

Casualties of the Mexican Drug War (in 2009 alone) = 15,273

There are more Mexican refugees (Illegal Immigrants) living the US then there are Israelis or Palestinians in the entire world.

Events happening in Mexico have a much larger impact on the day to day lives of Americans then anything happening between Israel and Palestine. The war on drugs and the Mexican border problem have a greater impact on the US economy, the job market, crime rates, and human life then anything happening between Israel and Palestine.

Newt knows this, but because he is running for office in 2012, he can't come out and say he doesn't prioritize relations with Israel.

Business by far destroy's more value then government ever could.  Wall Street created 60 Trillion dollars in unsecured debt.  That's why the World is in a Global Recession.  And as long as you keep believing the Republican bull these guys will NEVER go to JAIL.  

Because, Republicans have been protecting them for the last 3, err, 12 years.

The ""Obama Deficit"" is caused by Bush deregulating Wall Street, allowing them to go 3/1 leverage to 30-40 to 1 leverage.  Which created massive loss potential.
- Catastrophic Drop in Revenue: Bush
- Catastrophic Rise in Government Programs to stop working people from economic Failure, which put a floor under a depression causing it to ""only"" be a recession.
- Obama is responsible for 800 Billion in Stimulus.  Hardly anything compared to Bush War Spending.

**Government spending also creates ASSETS that have PRODUCTIVE uses.  Compare that to the Bush Tax Cut Creating Wall Street and Real Estate Bubble, with 100% of the Money Blown Up in Smoke.  Completely Worthless Tax Cuts that just Vaporized.

&gt;Just to underscore what is — and is not — motivating the Obama administration’s objections to this bill, Sen. Levin has disclosed, as Dave Kopel documents, that “it was the Obama administration which told Congress to remove the language in the original bill which exempted American citizens and lawful residents from the detention power,” on the ground it would unduly restrict the decision-making of Executive Branch officials. In other words, Obama officials wanted the flexibility to militarily detain even U.S. citizens if they were so inclined, and are angry that this bill purports to limit their actions.

I just want people to realize that even if Obama grand stands and veto's the Defense Bill, he still has the powers which everyone is currently freaking out about.  Also if you were unaware, this has happened before with Defense Bills, just look at the [2007 John Warren Defense Bill](http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/2-bush-moves-toward-martial-law/): 

&gt;“the President may employ the armed forces, including the National Guard in Federal service—to restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States when, as a result of a natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident, or other condition in any State or possession of the United States, the President determines that domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the State or possession are incapable of (or “refuse” or “fail” in) maintaining public order—in order to suppress, in any State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.”

"I do hiring and this is complete bullshit. There are companies that are very elitist, and will have quirks about who they interview or hire(all based on andoteal evidence over the career of the hiring manager and the HR personal).  We got some crazy shit requirements but what it really comes down to is an employer can see a job history is bad so they are willing to wait a bit longer for someone with a bit more stablity(has proven they can handle the job stress and not run under the slightlist sign of difficulty). 

What you should be pissed off about is how much productivity you are expected to do if you've kept the same job during the entire recession(1.5 or even 2x as much work for same pay or reduced).  

Companies do want to hire new people, but they want to train as little as possible. Companies are tight on the purse strings and will leave a job open for several months rather then take a candidate that might not be there in 2 - 3 years. 

Reading this article makes me sick.  Why? Because it's bullshit pandering.  No asshole company has purposefully advertised they only want employeed people to apply(metric shit ton of litigation).  Employers weigh in the fact that you are working or not working(but it's not a, ""We won't consider individual x because he isn't working."").  Any candidate that comes at me with this while I'm interviewing them is a massive red flag.  They have been to a number of interviews and keep making the same mistakes. Usually they have something obvious wrong with them(interviews poor - cusses or talks bad about a pervious employer, dropping signs they will leave as soon as they get the chance, wears obsene stuff to the interview).  You would be amazed at how many people didn't get the job because they were over confident going into the interview.  

All that's going on here is Republicans are just trying to take one small part of the bill and say it's going to be a mechanisim for abuse.  They don't like Obama, they stated they wanted him to fail.  They don't give a shit about the economy, you or me.  They know that if the economy started speeding towards recovery, he'd get relected real quick.  Republicans, ""Fuck Obama. The more people that suffer, the less likely they are to relect him."" 

td;lr Republicans oppose Obama for inane reason. Nothing that they are talking about is even related to creating or destorying jobs. It's not a factor in the hiring process. Besides, think about it for a second; if a company does use that for it's hiring process, you might not want to work for them anyways.",2
"&gt;Regardless of any of Obama’s other bullshit, this is closure for the United States. No, it doesn’t “change” anything in terms of numbers, and we don’t even know how much power Bin Laden even held. But what it does change is a mindset. Every breath that Bin Laden was allowed to breathe mocked the efforts of the United States. Even if him being dead doesn’t change the “threat” of terrorism, the killing of Bin Laden is a statement to the rest of the world that the priorities of the United States are to end this chapter and move forward.

So you're accepting that its entirely symbolic, and as such it hasn't changed anything except in the minds of bloodthirsty flag waving types who now have ""closure"".

&gt;And in terms of historical significance, I believe we have just witnessed events that defined the last generation for America. The 2000s marked the events of 9/11, and the embarrassing clusterfuck that followed. At the beginning of the 2010s, Bin Laden is eliminated and the United States can grow the fuck up again.

It grows up by celebrating the death of a man like they just cured AIDS?

Where were all these mourning every time a US smart bomb took out a civilian apartment block? Where were they celebrating every time a US military convoy got hit by an IED?

After all, if its okay to celebrate the deaths of murderers, surely they should celebrate the agents of 100,000 civilians deaths, much more than 3,000.

"You're absolutely correct.  He certainly did.  However, Obama did not cut off the entire deliberation over partisan politics.  Eric Cantor was being very rude, interrupting, refusing to listen to the other side's view. 

Thus, Obama walked out saying ""I'll see you tomorrow"".  Multiple accounts of it mentioned that it was not an explosion, nor an angry retort.  Mr. Cantor's account was otherwise, and I'd imagine Fox news ran with it too but as I refuse to watch such shoddy reporting (and this goes for CNN too), I couldn't say :P. 

Boehner walked out, essentially refusing to acknowledge the other side's points despite some level of agreement between the two sides and effectively cutting off the entire debate.  

In my view here, that's a HUGE difference.  Walking out to maintain the peace before things DO get that bad is one thing.  I think Mr. Obama made the right decision.  Boehner walking out and then speaking publically about not being able to make compromise and how the other side is inflexible -- that's playing politics.  There's a huge difference there.  It's like comparing apples and oranges.

To be fair as well, Mr. Boehner does have a point and that is that the discussions needed to be held in congress and that much has been true for some time.  Much of this has been happening behind closed doors and not primarily with floor debate.  Such a limited pool of debate limits the angles you can approach the situation from.

I'd be interested to see if Mr. Boehner's next move is to start bipartisan debate or whether his next move is to try to cram through more legislation on cut, cap, and balance, or more partisan politics.  I'm expecting the latter two given republican/tea party inflexibility and a very limited timeframe.

Likewise, i'll be interested to see how the Democrats can come up with reasonable spending cuts to satisfy the republicans whilst being able to procure key increases to balance the budget.

For a supposed agreement that was supposedly like 83% cuts and 17% revenue increase, which is an unprecedented compromise favoring the republicans' side, I'm very surprised that this matter hasn't been resolved already.  It makes no sense logically.  I therefore have concluded to myself, that this isn't about the default or the debt limit or the debt at all.  In my opinion, arguments about those are pure rhetoric.

End of the day, all of this is the same ol' republican bullshit rhetoric.  Compromise was tried and has apparantly failed.  I hope the Democrats can grow balls and take action rather than let Republicans blatantly screw the country",6

"Between February 2010 and May 2011 -- the 15-month period Goolsbee was referring to -- the U.S. economy created 2.1 million private-sector jobs. By contrast, following the previous recession, the economy actually lost 60,000 private-sector jobs during the equivalent period, which ran from August 2002 to November 2003. 

There’s little question that the Obama recovery is stronger than the George W. Bush recovery -- in large part because the Bush recovery was so anemic. Not only did the Bush recovery produce job losses during the 15-month period Goolsbee cited, but it also produced job losses over the full 23-month period. Over the first 23 months of the Bush recovery, the economy actually lost 757,000 private-sector jobs and 577,000 total jobs.

"&gt;Read my other posts in reply to this one as to why this is a circlejerk.

I agree this is a circlejerk.

I disagree that this thread title is somehow injecting ""facts"" into the circlejerk.

&gt;I couldn't care less about when either of them won the noble peace prize.

Same here.  That doesn't mean that I look at factually untrue statements and come to the conclusion that someone is putting facts in the conversation.

&gt; Henry Kissinger is a war criminal in more ways than just the bombings of Cambodia and Laos.

Agreed.  That doesn't mean that I look at factually untrue statements and come to the conclusion that someone is putting facts in the conversation.

&gt; If anything, as stated elsewhere in this thread, Kissinger's award is all the more deplorable, having been received after his involvement in the mass killing of innocent civilians.

Agreed.  That doesn't mean that I look at factually untrue statements and come to the conclusion that someone is putting facts in the conversation.

&gt;Obama received his less than a month into office.

Factually untrue.  The award was announced in October of '09 and he accepted it in December '09.

&gt;The real fact is that the noble peace prize is pretty irrelevant.

Agreed.  Again though, this doesn't mean that a factually untrue thread title should be looked at as a case of someone putting ""facts"" in the way of the circlejerk.

&gt;Where should our focus be? - On acknowledging Kissinger et al. as war criminals; on whether or not we should be involving ourselves militarily in the Libyan conflict - not whether or not current or future noble peace prize recipients should bomb things. Save that circlejerk for people who care more about American Idol than the wars we're in.

Agreed.  The focus SHOULD be on if involving ourselves in Lybia is a good move or not.  However, when people use factually untrue thread titles and people come in and post things like ""Stop putting facts in the way of the circlejerk"", I tend to lose faith in the ability of these individuals to actually hold a rational, fact-based discussion.

"&gt; Look, first off, if you don't understand what the term ""strawman"" means,   &gt; don't use it. Otherwise you sound ignorant.

Misrepresentation of someone's position. Which you have done by saying Ron Paul doesn't want anyone treated for Heroin addiction, or that he's fine with having addicts run amok breaking car windows to steal people's change. Straw man argument.

&gt; Secondly, Ron Paul is for zero mandatory treatment -- that's absolutely  &gt; legalization. 

Sure. Do we have mandatory treatment for flu? That doesn't stop people with the flu from seeking treatment, does it?

Being addicted to heroin is a very bad thing. As in, it will ruin your career, it will ruin your relationship with your friends and family, it will ruin your health, it will eventually kill you. I think we can reasonably expect that the vast majority of people who end up with a heroin problem will have very strong incentives to try and get themselves off it it, and either they themselves will seek treatment, or the people around them will push them to seek treatment.

&gt; The fact that this results in massive levels of property crime, he, and      &gt; you, don't care about.

Again, this is a straw man. RP is a Libertarian. He's all about private property rights. And no, the disagreement is precisely about that - whether ending the War on Drugs will result in increased levels of crime or decreased levels of crime. What RP is arguing (and I happen to agree) is that the War on Drugs has resulted in increased levels of crime all around.

Not to mention it's totally racist. Like I said, it's what the Ruling Class came up with after the end of Jim Crow to oppress black people.

&gt; No, he wants to get rid of it. In fact, he's been asked about this outright:

Well ok. You're right - he does want to get rid of it eventually. But the way he is proposing this be done is by letting people opt out. Not by cutting the benefits for people who have already paid into the system. Like I said, this is actually much better than what Obama is doing - which is essentially cheating old people out of the retirement money they paid into the system, and the benefits they were promised they would get once they retired. 

You're stuck in this liberal paradigm where the government is run by well meaning, honest, decent people who want to do good for the little people. If you look at what the government actually does, what it takes for politicians to actually get their @sses into office, the backroom deals they have to cut, etc., it becomes clear that that rosy picture is completely incorrect. Our government is actually run by a pack of insane, evil, vicious, corrupt bastards. And that is why Social Security operates more like a Ponzi scheme designed to steal people's retirement money to fund imperialism and militarism. What happens to surplus social security taxes that are collected? They go into the general fund, in exchange for US treasury bills. And what is the number one discretionary spending program that the general fund is used to pay for? Military Spending. By far the largest discretionary spending program. 

Has Social Security proven a boon for elderly people? Of course. But that is how all Ponzi schemes operate - the early investors make out like bandits, tricking later investors to buy in. But at some point, the majority of investors have the rug pulled out from under them. Which is what Obama is moving to do by appointing fiscal conservatives to the catfood commission. Which is what the government has been doing all along by lying about the actual rate of inflation.

I mean, think about it. The net difference between benefits paid out, and social security taxes paid in, is $1.6 trillion. Which is the amount held by the Social Security trust in the form of US Treasury bills. So they have $1.6 trillion in the bank, and the program is still running a surplus, and a **Democratic** president puts it on the chopping block? And what are you going to do when the Democrats do cut benefits? Vote for the Republicans, who've been saying all along we ought to do away with it?

Nah, I'm sorry, but we have to admit that in a f_cked up way Republicans have been right all along. And I say this not because I hate old people and welfare, but because I think our government is thoroughly evil and run by total crooks. And as far as I can tell, it has always been

&gt; So do kids in one state need to eat and kids in another state have the    &gt; ""freedom"" to not eat? Are there different eating requirements for poor     &gt; kids on a state-to-state basis?

Don't you think you're being absurd here? Do people really need the government to order them to feed their kids? If you mean different states will have programs of differing efficacy, well I suppose you're right. But, #1, the Federal government is itself not doing such a good job right now (cause crap like No Child Left Behind is BS), and #2 it's likely that states will copy other states that are doing better.

&gt; Yeah, and historically we can see how fucking stupid that is. In fact, just   &gt; a few decades ago THERE WERE NATIONAL RIOTS about this.

And no doubt there will be again if some State tried to reimpose Jim Crow. That is why I think fears of Jim Crow are irrelevant, overblown and paranoid. It's not a viable control mechanism any more. That is why they moved on to the War on Drugs.

&gt; Except THAT was tried too, and it FAILED. Why can't Libertarians read?

Sure, Federalists did defeat anti-Federalists. And right now we live in a world, a system created by Federalists. And it's not working well at all. Which means it's only natural people revisit this anti-Federalism business.

Habeas Corpus for example is still suspended.   Also, listen at a little after 6:00.   Sounds, like the Pot calling the Kettle black.   Didn't Obama authorize no-fly zone in Libya without congressional approval and even after 60 days of Presidential War Powers Act deadline he still did not seek approval.   Hypocritical.

**You may be correct** as there has been so much that has come out since then I cannot find it.   I seemed to think it was one of the speeches in a big stadium.   Anyway, it is also possible I was remembering him saying he would stamp out the unconstitutional things.  So, I will concede that it is possible I misremembered.

There is also a vast difference between being a Christian and wanting the degree of church and state entanglement that Paul calls for. 

(See for example, the Rev. Barry Lynn, who is a member of the Christian clergy, yet manages to support separation of church and state AND correctly state that the Founding Fathers wrote about it).",5

I'm sick of voting for people like this and HOPING it'll be better next time.  I can't see ANY way that Ron Paul's ideas will hurt this country any more.

The BBC incorrectly says that US citizens are exempt from the law.  But if you read what was actually passed, it doesn't in fact say that - what it says is that this law doesn't _change_ the rights of US citizens, a very different statement (and one that's basically meaningless, because _no_ law changes your ""rights"" under the Constitution).

This isn't just nit picking, because this Administration has not only said that they believe that Americans who are ""enemy combattants"" can be murdered anywhere in the world, they have demonstrated this publicly by killing them.  Just like the Bush Administration, they believe that the President can declare any US citizen anywhere in the world an ""enemy combattant"" and essentially revoke their civil rights completely.

You can quibble about tiny details, but Mr. Obama has consistently lead the charge to strip Americans of their civil rights, and this is one more step in this direction, and a very big one.  Even Bush never tried anything as audacious as this.

"&gt;Re: rock star image; just pointing out the obvious...Obama and Hitler were both hugely popular public figures.

So is Lady Gaga. Better keep an eye on her too. Thank you for pointing this out! We may have just dodged a bullet.

&gt;Re: knowing what Nazi Germany was like; can't say I lived there. But Americans have gunned down innocent children (Bradley Manning incident for instance) and Americans continue to use torture (waterboarding). So its really not that much of a stretch.

Michel Fourniret of France murdered seven little girls in cold blood, and on top of that, France has been guilty of military brutality as well in the past (ask Africa and Asia). In addition to all that, they've had some pretty rough economic problems to boot as of late. Oh shit! Better keep and eye France too. Actually, come think of it, by your logic, most European countries are poised to fire up the death camps and don jackboots any minute. Of course, one could argue that all countries have a problem with violence and america's massive population makes it more notable, but this would make it seem like a social problem, and isn't it more fun to pretend that Obama is about to sprout a bottle brush mustache?

&gt;Blood thirsty psychos? Give me a break, Americans are cut from the same cloth.

Please point me to an article in which American troops lit a US hospital on fire and shot the infants inside it in their cribs. Please, I'm dying to read this. Of course, one could argue that the lesson learned in Germany is that normal seemingly rational human beings can be tricked into committing heinous crimes, but again, by that logic, that makes it seem like an issue with humanity, and makes the idea of Obama one day accidentally doing the Nazi salute seem silly.

&gt;Thoughts?

So you're not **SAYING** Obama is Hitler, but it appears as though you've come to one of two conclusions:

1. America is right now how Nazi Germany was before the holocaust and Obama is poised to be the next Hitler. If you believe this, you are a complete moron. Read a book. Hell, watch a movie about Pre Nazi Germany.

2. America is in no way like Nazi Germany and Obama is in no way like Hitler, but we should be vigilant. If you believe this, than by your logic, shouldn't we be vigilant of ALL world leaders, and if so, than doesn't that make the Obama-Hitler comparison irrelevant?

My thoughts, you ask? You're just not a fan of america in general, and that's your right. There's plenty not to like. Guantanamo is an embarrassment, and our government is owned by corporations. Our airports are a mess, and our cell phone plans are insane. All of this is plenty reason to dislike us, and again, go for it.

But you are a fucktard for comparing this country to pre Nazi Germany. You might do well from an educational standpoint to sit down with a holocaust survivor and interview them about what Germany was like. Ask them about German troops smashing store windows that belonged to Minorities. Ask them about how the military came one day and relocated upper middle class families to ghettos. You might learn something.

And as for the whole Nazi thing: first of all, our populace is far too overweight to goose step in unison. Second of all, We allow jews, blacks, and gays to have talk shows, and enjoy them throughly.

Do we have problems? Yes, but perhaps you should look in a goddamn mirror, because your nation probably has some pretty bad issues as well. Does this make you potential Nazis? No. It makes you as fucked up as the rest of us.

"&gt; *""Obama abandoned us. Just because Obama was a huge sellout doesn't mean Liberalism isn't worth it.""*

Actually, yes it does. If you can't trust politicians, how can you trust Government to be your benevolent problem solver?

Liberalism is fatally flawed.

**EDIT:** I would just also like to add that progressivism generally sees Government spending and jobs as adding to the economy, which means they see cutting the bureaucracy as cutting jobs, and immediately see the families and jobs lost.

Without being willing to cut the bureaucracy, you're unwilling to make true changes to Government structure. This also prevents the forming of a well-designed Government.

In short, I think the goals of liberalism conflict directly with the methods progressives try to use to reach their goals.

You cannot create an efficient, benevolent state by depending on elected politicians and while using Government as a jobs program. These two can never fit together.

There are plenty of things I'd like to respond to in your comment, but there is a flaw in you that is so severe and so crippling to your ability to form an informed worldview that I am going to ignore everything else. You need to address this immediately; I doubt you understand how crippling your flaw is to your thinking.

What you have done in this argument is make an assumption about a fact based on an argument, and then you've used your argument to reaffirm this fact. The fact that you are capable of forming a circular chain of logic, allowing your assumptions about a disputed fact to reinforce the arguments you use in that dispute means that you can and do form opinions that are completely insulated from the outside world, and that have absolutely no need or use for factual basis of any kind.

Before I go on, let me be specific about what you have done.  You and I are having a dispute; you claim that Weiner did no wrong, and that the interviewer was terribly in the wrong. I assert that Weiner did some wrong, and that the interviewer was terribly in the wrong. Using this dispute, you have concluded that I am a conservative. You have used the assumption that I am a conservative to reinforce your point that your view on this dispute is correct and that mine comes from my political leanings.

You have never met me before, and this dispute is your only source of information, and your grounds for assuming I am far to the right are that I think a moderate person would feel Weiner acted in a petty way during an unfair interview.

So: are you correct?

Here's a reddit comment of mine from a few days ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ftpm8/crazy_driver_hits_cyclists/c1im97c

Read that and see if you still feel I'm right-of-center. Not good enough? What if I told you I voted for Obama in '08? No? How about if I told you my 2004 vote was cast for E. Geoff Braasch (as a write-in)? Does that mean anything to you? I'll spare you the Google-- he was a socialist candidate. I cast my 2010 vote for the green party locally in nearly every position. I bike to work rain or shine or snow. I refuse to use air conditioning if it's below 100 or a heater if it's above 35. I donate to open-source software and I run Linux. The odds are very, very good that I am to the left of you.

I want you to reflect on just how horribly wrong your conclusions were on this subject, and then I want you to recall how absolutely certain you were of those conclusions. Now think about how unlikely this exchange was-- the only reason your flaw has been made so crystal-clear is because of a confluence of circumstances: 1) Your arguments are in writing, and so you can't misremember them; 2) I happen to be a person interested in arguing rather than letting a subject drop after a few minutes (that's pretty unusual), 3) Your claim happens to be one that is fairly demonstrably false, because while it is abstract, there are many concrete manifestations that we likely agree are clear. Imagine how much more this flaw affects your reasoning when it comes to more abstract things! Imagine how rare it is for your mistakes to actually be clearly demonstrated to you!  This is no minor fallacy, this way of thinking is a cancer that undoubtedly contaminates every thought you have. 

This is not something you can ignore. We (the US and anyone who cares about its future) need you to get out of your insulated, self-reinforcing mindset. No doubt you see this mindset in others-- for example, much of the Fox News crowd. And I'm not claiming you're wrong-- of course it's the case. But in finding this flaw in others, rather than to be wary of it in yourself, you've chosen to point the finger at others and turn away from yourself. You and people who think like you are crippling this country, destroying the national dialogue, misdirecting political debate, and dumbing down the media.

This is no joke-- it is important, and it is urgent. Until you've fixed this flaw, you need to understand that your worldview is unfounded, even where it happens to be correct. You need to understand that you are not helping us by voting, or by discussing issues with other people. With your mindset, you serve only to bring your community and your country down. Please reflect on this and fix it ASAP.",0

There is nothing that can replace this much power generation and liquid transportation fuels in such a short timer.

"http://tynan.com/idiots

 My favorite example is when people think a politician is an idiot. No politician is an idiot. It’s their job, and their job is under a lot more scrutiny than yours is. Given the amount of politicians out there, the odds of an idiot being elected are just about nil.

 Let’s take George Bush, because no one likes him. I don’t like him. More than any other politician, his policies have adversely affected me. I care about privacy and I care about traveling, and both became significantly worse under his watch.

But guess what? He had a LOT more information than I had, so I give him at least enough credit to assume that he did what he did for good reason. From my perspective, terrorism is a joke, airport security is nothing but theatrics, and spying on people is a gross offense. But I don’t know anything about any of these things. George Bush did. So it’s probably a lot more likely that he knew stuff I didn’t know, and made some hard decisions as a result.

Now we come to Obama. His platform was hope and change, and we’ve gotten no change, and there’s not much hope for it either. Is Obama a liar who tricked us all to get into office? Probably not. He said he’d get us out of war because, with his privileged yet limited information as a senator, that seemed like the best course of action. Then he became president and got more information, and reversed his course. I don’t think he’s dishonest or malevolent, I just think we have no idea what’s going on.

I’m reminded of this idea whenever I watch people watch sports. They all think that they’re smarter than the coach and the refs, yelling at the screen, telling the people on the glowing box how dumb they are.

Maybe, just maybe, the people who rise to the top of these hyper-competitive fields aren’t complete idiots. Maybe they’re actually very skilled at maneuvering through minefields that we don’t even know exist. At the very least, it’s a serious possibility that should perhaps temper our criticism.

"&gt; Yes they passed a larger bill which contained many other items

Yes. The larger bill was the compromise. That's all that I and everyone else said. I assume you agree with us all on that point, even though you seem determined not to call it a compromise. A bill was passed with some stuff Democrats wanted, some stuff Republicans wanted, and some stuff that everyone wanted.

&gt; Yes. That would be an example of compromise but it doesn't fit this situation well at all. A more appropriate example would be if you both wanted to watch the same movie. But she also wanted go to dinner at a five star restaurant. You could explain how you could not afford to take her there. But she wouldn't give an inch. So unless you took her to the five star restaurant, neither of you were going to see that movie both of you wanted to watch. She could have compromised and gone to a slightly less expensive place, but she ain't budging. Why? Because she refused to compromise. Now she could bargain to give you sexual favors in exchange for going to the restaurant. But that only makes her a whore.

That's not entirely correct either. First, the relative costs are screwed up. [Most of the Bush tax cuts went to the bottom 98%](http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/07/news/economy/tax_cut_deal_obama/index.htm):

&gt; Bush tax cuts: $544.3 billion. The package would extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone for two years.

&gt; The bulk of that cost -- $463 billion -- is for the extension of cuts for families making less than $250,000, including two years of relief for 2010 and 2011 for the middle class from the Alternative Minimum Tax.

&gt; The rest -- $81.5 billion -- is attributable to the extension of cuts that apply to the highest income families.

So let's change your example to say that both people wanted to go to a 5 star restaurant, and only one wanted to see a movie too. And, of course, they can't afford either (the deficit is over $1 trillion).

&gt; It does not mean she compromised on [the movie].

Correct, but the whole deal is a compromise. That's all everyone (except you) is saying.

&gt; How about the thing we have been arguing over this whole time like the tax cuts for the other 98%?

Okay, but they already did that. I was talking about what they could be doing now.

"&gt;So who would do enough? Obama? Bachman? Romney?

Obama is more likely to get legislation past than Ron Paul. He has a party behind him, Ron Paul wouldn't get cooperation from his fellow Republicans. 

&gt;We're not going to get someone who will single handedly save the country

Right.

&gt;but there needs to be a change in the dialogue don't you think?

Sure, but Ron Paul being president (something that isn't going to happen anyway) doesn't necessarily need to happen for there to be a change in dialogue.

&gt;? Wouldn't you like to have someone seriously take Obama to task about the Patriot Act, the ongoing wars, and continuing to flush billions of dollars down the toilet on a failed drug war when we're in a financial crisis?

The real problem here is that your set of priorities are not realistic. I would love for them to abolish the Patriot Act, end the ongoing wars, and stop the failed drug war. However, I know that these things cannot merely end at the whim of the president as much as you might think otherwise. The wars are ending, just not as fast as you'd like apparently. Obama seems fairly committed to a slow troop withdraw presumably because that is what the generals have suggested. The Patriot Act in no way affects the average citizen, its a horrible bill, but in majority it is benign. Thus its low on the list of things to be changed. The failed drug war is, again another shitty thing, but it wasn't instituted by Obama, and to tackle it right now would distract away from more important issues. Jobs and the Economy both trump these issues currently. Certainly tackling some of the issues you mentioned would be of financial benefit, but not enough to actually solve the issues that are most pressing. Do you understand? Ron Paul would have to do pretty much what Obama is doing right now. Jobs, the Economy, and long-term austerity. He wouldn't have time to do much else, unless he wants to ignore the American people.

"Uhhh, Obama voted to renew the Patriot Act.  I mean, sure the Republicans passed it (and it was strangely written before 9/11), but maybe this anger should be directed to those who now actually hold executive power.  You can't just get angry at your retarded brother (Republicans) all day.  ",-3

I wouldn't blame Bush directly for the economy any more than I would blame Obama.  Our economy has been systematically driven into the ground since we got on board with a private central bank. 

&gt;ignored bin-Ladn [after the USS Cole and African embassy bombings]

Yeah, he did play a lot of golf.  However, if you are blaming Bin Laden (and by extension Bush) for 9/11, you should probably talk to the [FBI](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article13664.htm).  Even they don't think he had anything to do with it. 

&gt;said that all stem cells were human, except for the one's that weren't

He did say some dumb things.

&gt;let the workers at the WTC pile go in without respirators

Obama let the gulf cleanup workers go in without proper equipment.  In the coming years we'll hear much about the BP ""Gulf"" Syndrome.

&gt;started planning an attack on Iraq BEFORE going after bin-Ladn

Iraq was an illegal war.  Obama has shifted the burden in that war from servicemen to contractors (contractors cost about 3 times as much).

&gt;he dressed up like fighter pilot Barbie and pretended to fly an airplane.

Pretty sure he was part of the Air National guard at one point, though I can't say for sure if he ever actually flew.  That said, it was a tad premature to declare mission accomplished.  It still isn't accomplished if we are still there.

&gt;Obama passed Health Care.

Without single payer or medicare for all it is nothing more than an unconstitutional giveaway to the insurance companies...as if they had trouble making their profits.  True, those with pre existing conditions will have an easier time getting coverage, but at the cost of making everyone purchase a product from a private entity?  You can have it.

And none of that cancels out Obama's betrayals:

-Patriot Act extended

-20 years proposed for streaming

-added Pakistan, Yemen, and now Libya to our theaters of destruction

-Guantanamo still open

-Wants to be able to assassinate US citizens (he actually made Bush look like a card carrying member of the ACLU on this one)

-Fell back on promises to add oversight to the Patriot Act, prosecuting those that ordered torture, ensuring transparency in government

-Economy way down (but war way up)

-Allowed tax cuts for the rich in spite of supposedly being ""for the people"".

Socialism implies spreading resources and control to help the people. The bailout did **not** do that in any way, in fact it just made things worse for the people, because it included no accountability for banks, no control over banks, and no restrictions on banks.

&gt; All to get environmentalists to support tax hikes they already support? Would you like to change your hypothesis? Some motive that is actually plausible?

Some of us *smart* environmentalists realize our government - especially our MILITARY - is responsible for an INCREDIBLE amount of pollution.  And you just want to funnel more money towards them.  Some of us saw the government - under The Great Savior Obama's orders -  ""fix"" the BP oil spill by spraying chemicals that mixed the oil in with the water, making it impossible for nature to fix it, and turning the entire Gulf of Mexico into a giant biohazard.  Some of us have actually done the research and realize agencies like the EPA do absolutely NOTHING to stop pollution by major corporations and the government.

"I think you're missing the hook here. The tax hikes and killing the individual mandate would only come in to play IF congress failed to enact tax and entitlement reform next session.

Boehner then countered with fine, we'll do that if you also include a repeal of the individual mandate if congress fails to act, since that would give the D's an equal incentive to come to the table and deal. Both parties standing to lose something big if they failed to reach a deal on tax and entitlement reform, that's the equation. Repealing in individual mandate was never a stand alone take it or leave it proposal. 

Here's my prediction. Boehner just said screw you, Obama, we'll work this out between the house and the senate and leave you out of the deal. My guess is that Obama will want to be seen as part of the solution so he'll capitulate and a deal will be worked out that includes him. ",3

I'm going to go on a different track with this because I realized that I was taking a philosophical approach to defend my argument instead of a practical one, which is kind of dumb. But I was talking with someone else in this thread and I'd like to copy and paste what I said to them. He said that no one has a moral claim to another's wealth in society, which goes along with your question of why a greater percentage of your money should be taken from you than from someone making 50k/year. My answer: 

""No one ""owns"" money. It does not have your name printed on it, it belongs to the ""United States of America."" If the economy completely crashed tomorrow, all ""your"" money in stocks and banks would be gone. The whole point of money is that it stays in circulation. If you have a job, you earn money which you can trade in for whatever you like, but that money must be circulated in order for the economy to work. What is happening right now is that HUGE sums of money are being funneled into the laps of a few people, who are stockpiling it up and not returning it to the system fast enough. When the money is not returned to the system, it cannot be used for other things, like funding education and paying people for their work. When this does not happen, the economy breaks down and society falls with it. It might take a while, but the country's less than 250 years old and the top 1% possesses about 40% of our total wealth. This is only going to continue to grow. How long until it reaches 50%? 60%? What do you think is going to happen as that number gets higher and higher? Does starting a successful company justify the damage this is causing?""


So you see, while you may have ""earned a billion dollars honestly without negatively affecting anyone,"" the very existence of billionaires throws off the economy because the economy wasn't designed for a few people to hold so much wealth for such a long period of time. We use a progressive tax system to force some of that money back into circulation, keep things running smoothly, and pay for public programs that benefit society as a whole, while still allowing the earner to enjoy most of his income.

Because the liberal democrat who introduced the amendment was lobbied heavily by walmart.

no, that's a fact.  Not all opinions are facts, but this one is.  There are many legitimate concerns to hate Bush:

2.) He did not pay for the Iraq war nor Afghanistan - fact
3.) Unpaid for prescription drug coverage (along with #2, this is the major reason why we have a 14 trillion dollar deficit) - fact
4.) Torture - fact


these are not opinions...these are facts.  These facts are reasons why Bush was hated not just by every non republican in the US, but pretty much the entire world.  The entire world was united against Bush...not because they had some sort of agenda like you allege, but simply because Bush was just a bad, bad president.  Not because he was conservative...but because he was a bad president.

that's because you have to wait for Obama's presidency to end before you can make a claim on the success or failure of his presidency.  For Bush, however, you can make a reasonable assumption - and the overwhelming response from independent sources is that he was a complete failure.

Bush's presidency was very successful...in implementing a disastrous policy.

For the big boys, it’s the cost of a day’s worth of toilet paper, for you, it’s a few months rent.""

With that said, I am glad that someone else can relate to me in regards to this - I have noticed on a local level that my neighbors whom are hard-working and respectable blue-collar workers are packing-up shop and relocating. I have gone as far as personally loaning funds to a long-time family friend to supplement their cost of living and help establish a college fund. Granted, it wasn't much, but it was still a helping hand.

I completely agree with you in your closing statement and it really is a game of choosing the lesser of two-evils. With that said, I believed in Obama's campaign rhetoric in 2008 and almost voted for him. His credibility and past-performance (or lack thereof) were the influences that convinced me otherwise. 

Every Presidential candidate has a great vision to lead our country - if not, they are not a leader and will surely not become President. I think RP recognizes that today is the day of days if you will. Obama had his opportunity to persuade me to vote for him - however, he failed. 

I understand many of the complexities and difficulty of responsibility that comes with the position, but it is hard to believe a man that has backed out or will not approach certain issues. For example, to highlight my point further, in 2009 and 2010 YouTube hosted those ""digital town halls""; two years in a row the top user-ranked and submitted question related to Marijuana. As a non-marijuana smoker, I can see the 'laughable' approach to disregarding the question; but it was down-right disrespectful the way that he handled an issue that affects nearly 14 million citizens. Gitmo, his continuous efforts to penalize whistle blowers, his cabinets inability to handle crisis', and much more - have all been let downs.

His approach to Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and the entire Middle East conflict that started in January has failed. He ran on an ""anti-war"" campaign and is actively involved in 3 - 4 including the ""drug-war"". Granted, he cannot head every topic or adequately apply resources to 'problem areas', an attempt or new proposition to handling said problem would be refreshing. 

When it came to UHC it was done so quickly that it can not possibly cover and service all of the individuals it intends to without causing a financial disruption somewhere. The idea is genuine and well-intentioned, but poorly executed. 

Among many other items, I feel as though it may be a time where good character will outweigh good policy. Obama led many to believe that his policies were grandiose and there were just that - but stream-lined with luster to cover the shit underneath.

Politics is a fool's game that has no winners except those funding the politician. It's when individuals do not take the time to research and find a representative that adequately represents them - not necessarily in terms of crossing every t and dotting every i, but someone that holds a majority of their beliefs, that our country leads down certain paths. I have always liked Ron Paul and I think that given an opportunity, he could do great things for America socially that will lead into financial revival and security.",2
"&gt;Senate Republicans tried to make Democrats hold a quick vote on President Obama's jobs-stimulus bill Tuesday, but were blocked by Senate Majority Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who is sponsoring Mr. Obama's bill but who said other matters take priority.


ok. I don't get it. Republicans wanted to have the vote right now, and dems didn't? 


&gt;With that in mind, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, tried to force a vote, which presumably would have resulted in a humiliating defeat for the White House.

Impeachment has to begin in the House of Representatives which under GOP control will never happen for a Republican Supreme Court Justice.

"&gt;You can expect lots and lots of this in months to come. Here’s National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar, telling Obama not to get all populist. The only evidence he offers is that Obama’s approval is really low right now, in contrast to when he was running for president and had the support of lots of independents. I assume I don’t have to bother refuting that. But here’s my favorite part:

&gt;&gt;    Listen to Washington Wizards and Capitals owner Ted Leonsis, who maxed out to Obama’s 2008 campaign and is a reliable contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. “Someone needs to talk our president down off of this rhetoric about good vs. evil; about two classes and math,” Leonsis wrote on his blog.

&gt;Indeed, what more evidence do you need than the opinion of a billionaire who owns three sports teams and recently bought a 20,000 square foot house for $20 million? He’s the guy to ask if you want to know how populism will play with the regular folk! Egad—did Kraushaar not realize how stupid that would sound when he wrote it?",1
"The reason the Republicans are hysterical about holding trials of Guantanamo prisoners anywhere on US soil is because these prisoners have a legal standing to bring [War Crime](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/18/parts/i/chapters/118/sections/section_2441.html) charges against those who authorized their torture all the way up the chain of command.

But jail time is not what worries the GOP since they granted themselves immunity from persecution for war crimes.  It is the fact that if charges of war crimes were merely filed against Bush administration, the GOP would simply implode in next elections.  Now the question is why Obama protects Bush, his policies, and the GOP against a very vocal protest of his own base?  Especially in view of uncivilized treatment he receives from them.  Makes one wonder…",1

"&gt; I thought the US constitution only spoke of ""citizens"" in regards to eligibility for running for public offices (for the most part). It seems all other parts refer to ""people"" in general.

Yup.  You've put your finger here in the big error that's implicit on this ""Obama is ordering the death of American citizens"" outcry: the idea that it somehow makes a difference whether the target is an American citizen.  

There are legitimate questions to be asked on whether the executive is overreaching its power here, and whether we need greater checks and balances on its power to go and kill people abroad; I'm inclined to say that yes, we do.  But the powers of the executive in this regard are the same whether the target is Anwar al-Awlaki or Osama bin Laden.

Basically, it's the job of the legislative and judicial branches to provide oversight and prevent the executive from abusing its power.  We may legitimately ask whether they're doing this as well as they ought to—particularly Congress.  (The SCOTUS at least gave us [*Boumediene v. Bush*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boumediene_v._Bush).  Congress gave us the Patriot Act.)",2
"I have plenty of friends on facebook who express this very sentiment. They are ""outraged"" at the proposed tax increase on the wealthy, yet it doesn't affect them negatively because, honestly, none of my facebook friends are millionaires by any means. I don't understand why, but people have it in their head that not supporting the current president's agenda is the correct thing to do, and doing so is causing this filibuster in Congress that the Republicans are riding out until the 2012 election.

Here is a direct quote of a status that one of my facebook friends posted 2 days ago. It received 7 ""likes"" from people who agreed with it:

I have never heard this said as plain or as well. Class war at its best.

The folks who are getting the free shit, don't like the folks who are paying for the free shit,because the folks who are paying for the free shit, can no longer afford to pay for both the free shit and their own shit,
And,
The folks who are paying for the free shit,want the free shit to stop.and the the folks who are getting the free shit,want even more free shit on top of the free shit they are already getting!
...
Now... The people who are forcing the people who Pay for the free shit,have told the people who are RECEIVING the free shit,that the people who are PAYING for the free shit, are being mean, prejudiced, and racist.

So... the people who are GETTING the free shit, have been convinced they need to hate the people who are paying for the free shit, by the people who are forcing some people to pay for their free shit, and giving them the free shit in the first place.
We have let the free shit giving go on for so long that there are Now more people getting free shit than paying for the free shit.

Now understand this. All great democracies have committed financial suicide somewhere between 200 and 250 years after being founded. The reason? The voters figured out they could vote themselves money from the treasury by electing people who promised to give them money from the treasury in exchange for electing them.The United States officially became a Republic in 1776, 231 years ago. The number of people now getting free shit outnumbers the people paying for the free shit. We have one chance to change that in 2012. Failure to change that spells the end of the United States as we know it.

"It's worse than an issue of cherry picking facts.  Certain things said by ""pundits"" like Bill O'Reilly, Glen Beck, and liberal blowhards that can be almost as bad (they're not as popular, so their damage is more contained) are simply incompatible with objective reality.  Such ""facts"" are still believed by many despite the fact that they are completely false, however, and thus rather than having a real political debate about what might hurt or harm the country we are left with squabbles about what did or didn't happen.

As a minor example, the changes to light-bulb energy efficiency standards that recently took effect were decried by Republicans as one more way that Obama's administration  was trying to control the populous, when in fact the legislation was passed under Bush with significant Republican support in Congress.  Rhetoric trumps facts these days, and this is the problem with instant communication and a lack of critical thinking.",1

No, he didn't face a terrorist with a gun but aside from the guys on the ground he had the most to lose.  He took all that risk to fulfill a promise to the victims of 9/11 and he deserves all the credit in the world for making the most *Presidential* of decisions.",14

"&gt; you assume that vetoes have some sort of staying power in electoral politics.

OK, let me continue to elaborate: some legislation is more controversial than others. Patriot Act may be favored by the public but it is certainly controversial. Or anything involving abortion is a hot-button issue. GWB [*twice* vetoed a bill involving children's health insurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program#2007_reauthorization), which the House missed overriding by 13 and 15 votes respectively. Children's health insurance? No matter the details, that was a stain on the GOP -- it's tough to campaign against legislation involving children's healthcare. Did it have anything to do with the Democrat victories in 2008? Hard to say. I'd argue it was one part of it, and I know it was part of Obama's campaign (he also then signed it in 2009). Voting against that veto override could not have looked good for quite a few GOP House incumbents... plus siding with GWB was not very popular at the time even within the Republican Party.

So my point is that a veto takes more time and thus naturally draws more media attention at a very minimum, especially for controversial legislation.

&gt; in the PATRIOT Act, opinion is favorable.

I didn't realize that... I stand corrected on that example. Maybe I'm spending too much time on reddit and other ""alternative"" news sources. It's depressing that the mainstream feels that way. Your poll is from 2005 but my quick research shows not much has changed. *Sigh*

You're right, the sentence that you're criticizing is just me guessing what their motives for doing so might have been. It's just my impression, but I'd argue that the numbers would seem to bear it out.

Of course, candidates that would be in danger from this kind of voter shift are usually candidates in swing districts. And those often tend to be conservative Democrats, who previously were able to capture enough independents/left-leaning conservatives to get elected. Progressive Democrats still lost votes in their districts, but that just means that they now won by a smaller margin. Had progressive voters overwhelmingly flocked to those candidates while throwing out more conservative Democrats, the numbers should instead show that those candidates won by a *higher* margin than before.

"I know plenty of ""Christians"" who aren't very religious.  Sure there's a majority, but the majority of those people either don't go to church anymore or only pay it lip service.

As for literacy rates, so what?  Most people I know use their vaunted literacy to read absolute shit if they read at all.  Americans don't keep up with politics, geography, history and on and on.

As for the federal government's educational standards, they are still lacking in lots of areas.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnzEdSV8rqQ
And events like the Civil War and the Depression were politicized in the educational system because of who was in power at the time and right after those events.  So you have to wait for college to really understand that the Civil War wasn't all about slavery and that racism was rampant throughout the North and that the Depression was a complex economic event that may have been made worse by the government.

On top of the fact that if the public education system actually worked well, I doubt we would've had eight years of George W. Bush.

With regard to FEMA: You may be correct in your assessment, but that doesn't change the fact that any president can screw it up.  Even a well-intentioned president might appoint the wrong guy or just lie about it later.  FEMA will always be a political football so long as its part of the government.  Government always has political considerations.  Look at Obama with the war.  Over and over again, Dems defend Obama because he ""can't look weak"".  Now imagine the GOP make FEMA an issue.  He cuts the funding to placate them for no other reason.

Ron Paul says, get the government out whenever possible.  Why do we need a special department, when we have a National Guard, EMT's, fire departments, police?  All those are more local.  They understand the particular needs of that area.  Its members are known to the community and won't be considered outsiders.  They can tell the difference between looters and someone going back to their house.

On Social Security:  Except pensions are done.  Destroyed by Wall Street or eliminated all together.  Unless you're lucky enough to make enough money to save, Social Security is all you're going to have.  Maybe those seniors could've saved that money on their own or invested it.  Why should the government force you to save?  Why not allow people to opt out of it?

On Iraq:  The term ""combat troops"" is Orwellian doublespeak.  Troops are still getting shot at in Iraq.  Every soldier is trained to fight and shoot.  Here is a promise he broke:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VlXfs1K04g
On torture, Gitmo is still full of prisoners and there's still Bagram Air Base.  Glenn Greenwald covered this quite well:  http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2009/07/08/obama
Obama isn't just following the Bush policies, which is bad enough since he campaigned against them, he's institutionalizing many of those policies.  I understand supporting the Candidate Obama, but sadly, he's not president.  This other lying, warmongering Obama is.

Suicide rates amongst soldiers skyrocketing.  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/29/national/main6725690.shtml
An economy in a shambles, banks foreclosing on homes without even the proper paperwork, the TSA being able to grope your junk at the airport and soon, train station.

So a militarized police state is okay as long as the government doesn't dare discuss the possibility to letting grandma keep the money she earned over the last 50 years instead of forcing her to save it at gun point?

"When hundreds of people claim over and over again that *their* candidate is above corruption and outstanding in every way...that's when you know you're dealing with idealists. 

Even Obama doesn't get 1/2 the fawning comments that Paul garners in these subreddits.

Ya'll are downvoting me because you know it's true.",-1
I think he is expecting that Obama is going to run back to him screaming 'don't leave'. It could go either way at this point.,2
What lengths?  Did Obama extend the Bush tax cuts or not?  ,-13
"I am merely trying to point out the hypocrisy of the right-wing worship of Reagan when he has done many things which, by their standards, are more socialist (and thus ""evil"") than Obama.",8
"You will notice that the more airtime Ron Paul gets in debates, the better he does. He has yet to have a poor performance in a debate, and is continuing to grow. If Ron Paul becomes the republican nominee,  he will share HALF of the debate time with Obama. If he runs as third party, he has enough support to demand equal debate time between the republican and Obama.

 No matter which way you look at it, Ron Paul's message has finally spread to the American people, and his message will continue to grow exponentially,  and (as laughable as this may sound) I have no doubt that Ron Paul will be our next president.",-1
"Please, this kind of elititst rhetoric makes things worse.  Who are the intellectuals? Biden? Eric Holder? 



If Obama had such intellectuals running things we wouldn't have 13% inflation, 16% real unemployment, 14 trillion in debt and a housing bust not seen since the Great Depression.



Stop with the elitism.  Sitting in class rooms all of your adult life doesn't give you the skills necessary to run a country.  Maybe to take a test but not to run ANYTHING.",-3
"Duh,I know this is going to be unpopular as the truth usual is here, but because he is doing the same thing. There was no change, there was a mantra. He isn't going to go after Bush and Cheney because he and Biden are doing the same. Just as, if the media get their way and Ron Paul is again marginalized and ignored, the republican that will replace Obama will not charge Obama, as they will be doing the same...

Just as it ever was, at least until Americans smarten up.",1
"Really?  He's been consistently polling in the top 3 or 4, usually ahead of Bachmann, Santorum, Gingrich and Cain, and according to the Harris poll yesterday is only one of two Republicans polling ahead of Obama.  Anyone who denies his viability as a candidate is either a moron or a shill (or both).",2
"Hey Boehner, McConnell?

If you assholes refuse to do your jobs I have no problem letting Obama be President *AND* run both of your seats.

Well, actually, I have a big problem with that, because I'm not a fan of what he's done and not done with his Presidency so far, but I'm much less a fan of what YOU TWO jerks have done or NOT DONE... LIKE YOUR FUCKING JOBS.",2
"&gt;you're equivocating from my last reply

That's because I am staying on the original topic, rather than answer your tangents about wealth inequality

&gt; My intent was to point out the Obama administration is throwing liberals a bone to distract them from their overall conservative agenda and your counterpoint is...

Why didn't you state that rather than make some conspiracy headline?

My counterpoint is that your facts are incorrect, regardless of what you're attempts to tell people what to think.",1
"&gt; Obama didn't go before congress. Can you blame him?

Yes. The Constitution, and in turn our republic, doesn't mean dick if it isn't adhered to.",3
"Not sure if anyone here has watched Fox News from time to time but recently they have done a complete 180 on birtherism. All of them, even Beck and Rove, have completely discredited Trump's birtherism all the while when Obama was campaigning, all the TV personalities were foaming at the mouth to proof that he was not a US citizen because they have not seen his birth certificate. All of them now say they believe Obama is a citizen and is a valid president even before the long form release. Looks like Fox News secretly doesn't think Trump is the right right wing candidate. Seems very weird to see Fox News act like this.",1
"My economic crash scenario didn't calculate in their ability to steal 20 trillion. I forgot that ""new"" math thingie.

Got to spend 2 trillion less per year for at least 30 years, anything less is a lie. 

**Let the crying begin.**

&gt;On the backs of the poor, the weak and the powerless. Screw the needy and pretend to care.

Obama, governments charge from the 08 &amp; 10 election cycle was to ""make them famous"", whereby every single tax of old was to be reviewed regarding its collection and justification for its continued purpose. Those that could not be justified were to be reassigned toward a justifiable future generationaly sound purpose.

Until such is done not one single social services program can be reduced, and until generationaly self sustaining political/economic equilibrium occurs all past unjustifiable taxes are first reassigned towards social services then reassigned toward other purposes once balance is achieved.  ",2
"&gt;Because Obama wasn't a big enough hippie for you?

No, most of these people are of a me, me, me, now, now, now mentality. They are only a few short years away from realizing that they share this frame of thought with the Republicans be they convert political religions. They don't even know how much pain they are living in they have become so used to it.

"Obama is president, and the history books attribute everything that happens during president's four year term to the president. The Republicans won this round, and you will realize it when you hear the direction of the debates going into the election season.",5
