"Exit polls showed Obama was still favored to a Republican among Latinos. If racism was a major factor, I don't think this would be the case. They aren't anti-Obama; they're just pro-Clinton.

I think the endorsements by people like the mayor of LA and other strong members in the Latino community, coupled with Clinton's campaigning directed at the Latino community and trust built while Bill was in office are larger factors.

Certainly racism exists among minorities as you explain, and is displayed at its extreme in gang violence, but it's also true that voter turnout in innercity areas tends to be lower. Clinton won latinos in rural Texas. They aren't competing with innercity blacks for shitty jobs, but they do know how Bill handled immigration and expect Hillary to act similarly. They have no past experience with Obama.",1

Didn't consider the Army or Marines because their recruiters are desperate and shameless.  Not hard to see why.

You might be able to converse about the election season in general, but it probably is a little bit rude to ask their actual opinion.

And, rude or not, it's just not your *job* to find out. Even if the person didn't mind it, I'm not sure your employer would approve of you doing that.

The election is really a very divisive thing. There's not a lot of people who are ""Eh, McCain, eh, Obama, it's all the same to me."" -- They have *their* opinion, and will feel strongly about it.

I think multiethnic people are usually the most attractive. Barack Obama is one example. There's a guy I work with who's half white and half Asian, and he's a really beautiful man-- if he was taller he could be a model. Black/Asian is another really attractive combo most times.

Obama is a sell out and a typical politician of the Clintonian kind, with his finger planted firmly in the air testing for the winds of public opinion and shifting course with every change in the breeze.  You can plainly see it in the many pandering steps he has taken in the campaign, from his dismissal of lapel pins to constantly wearing them, to ""renouncing"" reverend Wright after saying he could no more disown him than his own grandmother, to pledging to renegotiate NAFTA then backing off, to pledging to vote against FISA then voting for it, to promising to ""sit down with the republican nominee"" and work out a way to take public financing then not even pretending to bother consulting McCain before rejecting public financing.  He is willing to the play the game of political calculus and take the most expedient path to the presidency, pandering along the way and speaking as vaguely as possible, rather taking any stand on principle.  Sadly, you have the same thing in John McCain, someone who used to believe that principles mattered, but who became the ultimate panderer with his literal and figurative embrace of the president after his loss to Bush in 2000.

"Right now, you have to also keep in mind the issue of damage control.  Bush has royally fucked us.  We need someone who is going to set the course back on track.

It is a myth that Republicans are fiscally conservative.   Historically, and you can look this up, Regan, Bush I, and Bush II have created the largest national debt EVER.  Why?  Because they subscribe to the theory that if you give all the money to the wealthy it will ""trickle down""  It used to be true that republicans managed money well.  Back in the days of Goldwater.  Which is why Ron Paul makes so much sense to a lot of people.  He does talk about fiscal conservatism in the traditional republican fashion.  But Ron Paul is not the issue here.  I'm not trying to change the subject.

Obama is the best bet right now because of many factors:

#1 the man is fucking smart.  You can tell just listening to him talk.  He's smart.  That's always good in a leader.

#2 He's charming.  Say what you will..  Politicians need to be charming.  They need to charm other leaders.  They need to appeal to people.  Charisma +5 helps in that game.  So don't discount it as trivial.  People need to like leaders in order for the leader to be effective.

#3 He's reasonable.  He admits mistakes and he attacks his critics head-on.  Unlike other politicians he isn't trying to be perfect.  He even admits he doesn't know everything and that there will be mistakes.   He's only human what do you expect after all?  But here is what is different.  He course corrects when he recognizes poor judgement.  Some might call that flip flopping.  I call that good leadership.  IF you are on a boat and you are heading into the wall of ice because of a nav error.  I don't want an arrogant captain insisting that his measurements were correct.  I want a captain who says, ""I was wrong, I admit I was wrong, lets get to work fixing the problem.""

#4 He's fucking inspiring!  People need to feel inspired in order to feel motivated to work as a team.  You've got to feel like there is something bigger than you.  He reminds you what is great about america.  What america could stand for, what america used to stand for.  FREEDOM and LIBERTY!

#5  He is a civil rights lawyer.  CIVIL RIGHTS!!  ACLU type stuff.  That is... for the people.  Not the companies.

#6 he has no PAC money.  All his contributions come from small doners like you (well, i'm sure he gets some big money from rich folk too) but he has recieved a HUGE chunk of his money from the people.  Over a million individual doners.

#7  I like him, and I don't like any politicians.

"Again, I agree. I think where we seem to be miscommunicating is in the nuances of the subject. Certainly it's not exactly half of the US who is profoundly ignorant, but a lot of them are. Even a fair number of people who voted for Obama are ignorant, they just happened to choose the right band-wagon. The thing is, Americans are highly responsive to logos and branding. We're consumers to the core. Obama became a brand. He's the only president I know who has a logo. I work in marketing, so I understand the power of this.


This country is driven by consumerism, and television -those two work hand-in-hand. It's to their benefit that Americans blindly follow trends and rarely question anything. It keeps them fat lazy and stupid, just how they like them.

There is a large number of people in the US who see this, know this and understand what it's doing to the country, but very few people are willing or able to hear it and take it in and understand it. The programming runs deep, and it's become a part of family creed in most households. Parents sustain their children on junk food and TV. Every child is being taught that everything they do is special. More importance is being put on celebrity and not on important things like education.

Yes, America was once great, but it's like an old plantation mansion: looks great on the outside, but once you get inside you realize that no one has been tending it for years, and it's structurally in a state of disrepair.

"Oh, of course you are correct about gangster types coming from all races.

I'm not an fan of Christian fundamentalists, either, but I have nothing against individual Christians who don't act like theocrats. 

Obama wants several new gun laws, for instance he wants to ban the sale or transfer of all semi-automatic firearms. Wanting to ban the sale of something generally implies you would want to ban the possession of it if you could.  Me and my friends will not give up our guns, therefore we would break his laws, therefore he would want us punished.

         4.  Other characters:
               1. Rev. Jeremiah Wright:  Embraces Black Liberation Theology (BLT), a Marxist derivative.  According to James Cone, the chief architect of BLT, Christian theology arises from oppressed communities and interprets Jesus’ work as that of liberation.  It plays on the victimization by the white community. Obama spent approximately 20 years in this church and appeared on the cover of the Church’s “Trumpet” magazine.  In the August 2007 issue of “Trumpet”, Wright argued that Jesus is “African” and attacked “white” Christianity as “make-believe”.
               2. Saul Alinsky, the father of community organizers who actively organized earlier in Chicago, was studied by Obama.  He applied Alinsky’s book, “Rules for Radicals,” and techniques on Chicago’s South side.  Alinsky’s son wrote, following the Democratic Convention, that Obama had learned his father’s lessons well.   Alinsky was, at the minimum, an atheistic socialist.  Clearly he was a radical. Obama refers to his training in Chicago as far more valuable than his formal schooling.  Sadly, the South Side is still reputed to be 80% worse off than the rest of Chicago.
               3. Antoin “Tony” Rezko, is a Chicago Slum Lord who is now headed to prison on several counts of political violations.  Rezko has been a huge fundraiser and helped Obama get a good deal on his home in Chicago’s Hyde Park.  He has helped Obama and, in turn, Obama has rewarded him with substantial “earmarks”.
               4. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – yes, the very governmental agencies at the root of our economic crisis – have given Obama their second highest political contributions (After Chris Dodd and just ahead of John Kerry, both democrats).  Remarkably, Obama achieved his rank after only three years in the Senate. “Follow the money” may be apt counsel!
               5. Malik Zulu Shabazz, the national chairman for the New Black Panther Party, said, “Of course there are connections between Obama’s associates and the Nation of Islam.”  Louis Farakan, Chief Minister for the Nation of Islam, calls Obama the “Messiah”.
               6. Frank Marshall Davis, a great influence on young Obama, a poet and member of the Communist Party USA, also held radical and racist views. 

NOTE:  Has any candidate ever had to throw so many former associates”under the bus”?  Ayers, Dohrn, Wright, Rezko, Pfleger, ACORN, Davis, et al.  There seems to be a definite pattern here!  Does he really renounce their politically radical positions (after his long associations) or simply seek to distance himself from election liabilities?  It appears to be the latter. 

   5. Because of his views on Life?  He has a perfect abortion voting record, even voting against the partial-birth abortion ban.  As an Illinois State Senator, he lobbied against the “Born Alive Infant Protection” Act and then voted against it.  He has since tried to defend his position, saying that if the bill had contained the federal language he would have voted for it – but the language was changed to become identical to the Federal version prior to his last vote.  When a nurse, Jill Stanek, complained that aborted infants were left to die among soiled laundry, Obama did arrange for an attractive room in which they could be left to die.  When asked by Pastor Rick Warren when life begins, he danced around the answer before claiming that it was simply above his “pay grade”. Should Christians be single-issue voters?  Should Ps 139:13-14 or Jer 1:4-5 or Ex 20:13 inform our voting choice?  How would Jesus vote?
   6. Because he has written two full-length books, but not a single important piece of legislation?
   7. Because he is a “uniter” and reaches across the aisle?  When Rick Warren asked for an example of a time he had reached across the aisle, Obama cited an ethics bill on which he had worked with John McCain.  Bad choice!  He did – briefly - then abandoned it and voted with his party.  John McCain wrote him a scathing letter, well before the campaign, asking Obama to forgive him for trusting him and taking him at his word.  He assured Obama he would not repeat the mistake.
   8. Because he is ready to be Commander in Chief, one of the chief responsibilities of every president?  He has no military experience.  He has pledged to cut billions from the defense budget, at a time when we are gravely threatened by our enemies.  He voted against funding for our troops, and won’t admit the “surge” has worked.  I can respect an opinion that contends we shouldn’t have invaded Iraq, but it too late and we are there.  If we precipitously pull out of Iraq, we risk losing everything accomplished so far plus all influence in the Mid-East.  Iran is poised to gain control of the entire region, except for our presence, and has vowed to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.  Leaving before our national security interests are secured, will lead to the future choice of whether to re-enter or concede the entire region to Iran.  Be assured it will be harder to re-engage the enemy after he has strengthened his grip on the region.  What kind of future credibility will we have with our allies and enemies?  Will our allies ever trust us again (When we did not “finish the job” during the first Gulf War, we left many trusting Iraqis to the mercy of Saddam Hussein – is it any wonder that we weren’t hailed as liberators when we returned for the second war)?  Will our enemies be emboldened by their victory over the “Great Satan”?  Perhaps Obama can talk nice to them and they will like us? 
   9. Because he has a great energy plan?  There is widespread agreement that we need to develop new sources of energy, as well as increase our conservation efforts.  Our country is blessed with huge energy resources, although much of it is currently off-limits.  The argument that drilling would take many years to benefit us is not an argument against drilling – it is an urgent argument to start now!!  We should have started years ago.   Lubricants, plastics, paraffin, fertilizers and many other products are derived from carbon-based energy.  For several years, we will need oil and coal to fuel our economy and transportation.   Nuclear energy technology is very well developed, as evidenced by France’s heavy reliance on it and our vast experience  -  we have even powered naval ships for over 50 years.  We need to do it all!  Obama has not come down on the side of drilling or clean coal technology or nuclear energy.  This is a huge National Security issue, not to mention the huge transfer of our wealth to nations that don’t like us very much.",1

"Obama's passed two resolutions since June '07 (one designates a National Summer Learning Day and another that commemorates some civil rights workers' deaths) with the rest of his resolutions/bills being stuck in committee (with a ""Democratic"" Congress, mind you).

Yea on Medicare Bill (69-30)

Yea on Iraq War Funding/GI Bill (92-6)

Yea on FISA Bill (69-28)

The partisan tension of this campaign among the candidates' supporters has been so vicious that I feared we would fall into another civil war.  I, like many others, stockpiled firearms, munitions, non-perishable food, potable water, and antibiotics.  Every single day I cultivated a killer instinct so that I would not be victim, and every day I died a bit more because of it.  

&gt;And just like that, the campaign was over.  There are no riots.  There are no slayings.  There are no patrolling militias.  Now, finally, relief.

&gt;Whatever our differences, whatever our associations, we are Americans.  I offer you my hand in friendship and support, if you'll only do the same for me.

But as much as I love my dad, he comes from an incredibly bright family. My uncles are all bright, successful people with good senses of humor. They just happen to believe that if Obama takes money away from the rich, the rich will all move to Canada. (Slight exaggeration there.) And they're more politically experienced than my father and I are. Most of the basic stuff - John McCain supports progressive taxes, Bill Clinton saw an economic boom - is stuff that they're prepared to counter with. They know at least how to sound convincing - I'm not old enough to know if they're talking out their asses or not.

So don't judge all of a person based on political insanity. Very bright people are often very right-wing.

*For the record, I consider myself independent, but I voted for Obama and hate the modern Republican party, and I believe what I do not because of my parents, but because I read up on the 2004 election and hated the people who let Rove coerce them.

I'm a registered Libertarian, but I don't think there is only one way to solve anything. Government-sponsored healthcare really isn't that bad of an idea, for example. There are better and worse ways, but what matters most is if the decision-makers are truly good men (of any gender, naturally).

I almost cried when I had to hang up abruptly because the people I was with really wanted to go to a living nativity in a nearby town. I told my family to call back in four hours, but by the time I went to bed they hadn't called. They went to a matinee. Then finally they called after midnight, but we only got to talk about 20 minutes before somebody accidently disconnected the call. Plus my grandma, the matriarch of the family, couldn't talk very much anyways because everyone's always demanding things of her. First she couldn't talk because she was operating the family taxi and then she couldn't because she had to set the table and serve dinner.

That's actually [not true](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/06/09/ST2008060900950.html). Both candidates will lower taxes overall, but Obama will raise taxes for the very rich (over $600k per year). McCain, on the other hand, will I guess just have a much larger budget deficit? Not sure.

Either way, the old line about democrats always raising taxes is bullshit for this election. Both candidates are proposing to lower average taxes. For all middle and lower class Americans, Obama will lower taxes much more than McCain.",7

We hope he's not absolutely corrupt, and that those interests are feminist leagues instead of oil companies, but at the same time he's not speaking to the American *people*.  He's not being straight; in fact, he's doing nothing but regurgitating pre-fabricated responses based on focus-group research.  That's really a shame to me compared to his powerful campaign slogans that I'd sincerely like to believe.  

Ron Paul speaks the truth and it shows.  That's why nobody can even hang with him in the debates; he eats them for breakfast when he's not being censored or asked stupid-ass 9/11 questions.  I realize reddit has turned into an Obama jerk-fest, and I'll be voting for him as well, but come on, within the context of the debates, he can't even beat John the-fucking-lying-bastard McCain?

--A Federal Libertarian and advocate of the welfare nanny state at the State level right here, European style.  

By the way, amidst the probable downmods I'll be receiving, does it not stand out to anybody that Obama hasn't shown a fucking ounce of principle?  He hasn't contrasted the powers-that-be on literally ANY seriously important issue: not really the war, FISA, the bailout, the failing dollar?  I'm seriously wondering, because I honestly think he performed rather weakly at the debates, and it seems like amidst a huge rhetorical platform (change), he really hasn't done anything new other than (which is notable, I guess) raising taxes for the elites (which does require some clout for sure).  

But, in regards to his rhetoric, rational people HAVE to admit that there's a major gap between his rhetoric and his actions, or even what he portrays at the debates .

"&gt;By default if more than four people downmod you then your comment will be automatically hidden. Only the popular opinion will be shown and your differing views won't see the light of day. It's kind of pointless to be voicing an opinion on a site when it'll just disappear.

That's a serious mischaracterization.  It would be accurate if posts with a vote of -4 were blocked or deleted.  But the fact that posts are only hidden, so that you have to manually press a button to see the content, is actually pretty hugely different from that.

The fact that any post gets below a -4 rating should demonstrate what I'm talking about.  You don't get a hugely negative score by nobody seeing your post after it hit -4!  There are many, many, many conversations that start with a post below the threshold, and continue with posts below the threshold (with people continuing to click to read the posts, and replying to them further).

If you've participated on, or even just seen, the sites where unpopular posts are deleted outright, there is simply no comparison.  Unpopular conversations will get *less* traffic here than popular ones, but they can take place, they can be widely viewed, they can continue, and you don't get deleted or banned for it.  

And by allowing them to be voted down, as opposed to no voting at all, the amount of pure trolling and griefing is reduced--though by definition, as posters don't get banned or deleted, it will never be entirely eliminated.

This is about the best tradeoff I've yet seen.  It is still flawed; it has problems.  I haven't seen a solution with fewer problems.

Incidentally, I do think it's a serious problem that unpopular *links* will be buried so quickly that nobody ends up seeing them.  For instance, with a couple of big exceptions like FISA, negative news about Obama gets very little coverage here.  But comments, which you were talking about, don't have this problem at all.",1

I am to a certain extent against both.  Being against a race and an ideology are two very different things.  It's time that we stop treating them on the same level.  Christians are making an active choice to participate in a culture of fantasy with a history of bloodied hands, nationalism, anti-rationalism, etc.  Taking part in that religion at all is at the very least washing your hands of the responsibility to pursue truth.  I can't and won't respect that no matter what the politically correct social stance of the day.

&gt;Obama wants several new gun laws, for instance he wants to ban the sale or transfer of all semi-automatic firearms.

Obama is running for president, not king.  The president can't pass laws, he can only attempt to exert influence over law makers.  Given this countries rich and diverse background on this particular issue, I'm going to highly doubt that you are going to see a congressional majority vote on such a law.

I don't think you should exclude the world around you, but I think that altruism taken to the extreme is more damaging than selfishness to the extreme.

I think Rand would support that line of thinking, even if her prose makes it appear more black-and-white.",6

I think people who are voting for Obama merely because Obama is black are not saying what their real concerns are, because it is not PC to say that you are not voting for him because he is black.

"No, communism is where everyone owns all goods including property, farm equipment, houses and cars. Under some models, such as the Soviet system, the government owns these resources for the people and redistributes them evenly in a planned, centralized economy.

Taking from the rich and giving to the poor is nothing like this.

Socialism is when labour unions and groups of people commonly own something as a group. i.e. factory workers owning the factory they work at. It can include government programs such as health care, the nationalization of natural resources and other such things.

Taking from the rich and giving to the poor is nothing like this.

The people who accuse Obama of being a communist or socialist are betting that a huge number of people a) find both terms repugnant, and b) don't actually know what these terms mean.

And it should be noted that Obama isn't technically raising the taxes for the rich, he's simply allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. You know, the tax cuts Bush implemented to stimulate the economy.",4

Lastly, I made a few outlines of the presidential candidates to review. Overall, everyone is simply better than our current president, though McCain is only slightly better (he gets a few points for actually going to war, whereas Bush gets a big fat zero) and Obama is moderately better because he can talk well and is charismatic and other countries like him (which is huge). Nader has got great policies and I'm voting for him but he really should step aside and let Matt Gonzalez take over already. You can see that the years of fighting have really caught up to Ralph and he's just desperately throwing everything he's got into this last month and you can see the toll it's taking on him. Barr and Baldwin leave a lot to desire for a true Ron Paul fan. McKinney is crazy but at least she's not evil! She gets a lot of credit for sticking up to Rumsfeld and demanding answers.

"The GOP held Congress and the presidency for 6 years and spent more in that time than the Democrats ever have.  They also greatly inflated the national debt.

If your dad persists, simply show him a pie chart of the national budget - one page per year for the past 20 years.  And also show a slice, off the pie, of how much we come up short.  As the chart is completely dominated by social security, the military, medicare, and debt, ask him (as I assume he's older) where he would cut to balance it.  Tell him that if we do not cut, the debt part will get bigger every year.  **COMMEND YOUR FATHER** on keeping your family out of debt (I cannot stress this enough), and ask him how he would balance this budget.

Most Republicans have never seen the national budget, and showing it as a pie chart gives them enormous perspective.

Finally, Obama is absolutely soft on war.  No rational human should want to simply blow up people in other countries unless they threaten us.  Not Israel - **US**.  If Israel wants a war, we will not stop them.  If any country really loudly threatens us and we do nothing, then ask your dad whether or not we should have invaded North Korea, which has nuclear bombs and definitely wouldn't mind selling them.

"It's pretty simple really.  Dirty, but simple.

Obama (or any candidate really) would have a powerful ally in the Clintons.  They really are a powerhouse family of political campaigners (especially Bill).  So it looks like (and this is my speculation), that Hillary and Bill have told Obama, 'hey, take care of our debt and we'll back you'.  

So Obama could do two things to accomplish this.  He could do it under the table, dip into the funds that his supporters have already paid him, and fork it over to the Clintons.  Or he could publicly ask for his supporters to help pay it off.  It's not fair and it sucks, but that's the cost of the Clinton's help.  

I think he's doing it in very open and fair way.  It sucks that this is how the Clinton's are behaving.  You would think out of loyalty to their party, they would just help Obama campaign, but it seems they are being sore losers.  

So it's not really about helping Hillary.  It's about helping Obama *purchase* the aid of the Clintons.",7

"Now, the problem this has to offer is that it's impossible to play a zero-sum game with your life. Your mother birthed you. Somebody helped to raise you. People taught you, people put up with your being a child, long enough for you to grow up and become an adult. Now, Ayn Rand shows Rearden trapped by a mother who insists on familial bonds despite her constant contempt. That's wrong. However, to go from that to saying that you owe nothing to the people who raised you for 18 years: there's a flaw somewhere in that. Even if you argue that your parents raised you selfishly, to see offspring, the counterargument is that you ought to take selfish pride in how you treat your parents.

Now extend that to a global perspective and you get a rough idea for how things being one-sided don't work out ideally.

Rand says that government exists for three reasons: to protect citizens from physical harm, to protect them in courts of law, and to protect their country. However: she's still dealing with a concept of government. Never once does she mention how this money is raised. How do you pay the policemen? The firefighters? The only solution offered beyond taxes is privatization. The problem there is that the private industry favors the wealthy, and while that's not unfair in and of itself it is easily abused, as can be seen by hostile monopolies. Max Barry illustrates this in one of his novels: when the poor can't afford to protect themselves, it barely is a crime anymore to abuse the poor in any way you see fit. Again: in a perfect world, without crime or hate, this works fine. In a perfect world, there is no need for government. But in a world even a shade off from perfect, you need a public sector.

A lot of things that libertarian requires to function require either blindness or compromise. Either you pretend that perfection is a possibility on a large scale - that a person can be lawful and absolutely pure without any corruption whatsoever - or you need to understand that things require some balance. You could argue that the poor deserve what they get in my previous example, because they stay poor: well, what happens if society divides further than it is now? Without checks, the rich are free to abuse the poor. That includes preventing their rise.

I think government should be reduced. So does Obama. He wants to end involvement in Iraq: that's a tremendous amount of money saved instantly. He wants to refine systems, streamline them, eliminate bureaucracy. I know that's a promise many politicians make, but the Internet era is the first time that collective intelligence can be applied on such a massive scale. It offers hope where there was none before.

Wealthy political entrepeneurs? You're mistaken. Nobody makes money by manipulating politics. They make money by manipulating _society._ The people who are big in the oil industry make money because people want oil. The lobbyists? They don't exist in a vacuum. They make their money because people require the services of lobbyists. In a pure libertarian system, there should be _no_ restrictions on paying for candidates. Why can't I donate a billion dollars to a man's election fund? Those restrictions are a part of the government's functioning. I think things should be restricted further, actually, to the point where you _can't_ buy an election with money. The problem with that is, any solution is going to require at least some taxpayer money. Any implementation that fixes the system adds more government surveillance.

You're arguing an entirely shallow viewpoint. You're contradicting yourself, too. Our taxes don't prop up the ruling class. They attempt to alleviate the problem for those that _aren't_ in the ruling class. Your problem isn't taxes. It's the misappropriation of taxes. And that's a problem. Taxes themselves aren't the problem. It's how they're spent.

If taxes are done correctly, I can live and thrive while still paying a part of my profit to other people. Is that absolute freedom? No! Not in the sense you're talking about. However, any system of bartering goods directly falls apart instantly once there's a hint of corruption. And the bartering system is the only system that exists purely and freely. Once you move over to anything short of a gold standard - and a gold standard only means standardized bartering - the system has a degree of impurity to it. And once that happens, you're forced to accept compromise, and compromise in such a system occurs because of taxes. And that compromise is good! It allows people to take risks they couldn't take otherwise. It lets people who're suffering continue onward with some hint of safety. It civilizes people who are otherwise savage.

There. Probably too long-winded for you - as far as I can see you're just spouting generalities - but that's my opinion on taxes and liberty.",1

And so he has envisioned a system in which you're given more freedom to pursue your dream, but at the same time in which you still pay taxes to support others.

So what you are seeing is people REALLY not wanting to see him loose because for once in a long time people actually feel like there is hope for a better future.

I mean, haven't you noticed that it was Bush that started the whole stem cell debate, which then led to the gay butt sex marrage debate, which then led to the whole evolution vs creationalism debate.  The guy just keeps bringing the stupidest things to the national attention.  I don't think it's Bush, but rather, his handlers that are doing it.  Manipulating and shaping the public debate.

I mean, since when is torture something that we debate?  I thought it was pretty well understood torture is bad and bad guys torture.

It's only because some talking head on TV says ""well wait a minute..."" remember that phrase...they use it a lot.  ""well wait a minute... is torture ok if....blah blah blah""  ... look, torture is not what good guys do.  We all know that.

But back to Obama... (sorry for the tangent)

"&gt; I'd almost definitely score higher than he would by a far margin

Score higher on what?  Some sort of mental aptitude test?  Let me put it this way: I used to think I was smarter than Barack Obama.  Many times I've questioned some action of his, or in some cases a lack of action.  Almost every time I've had to mentally concede that his was probably the smarter decision. (Examples: his decision early in the primaries to hold back on heavy campaigning until near the end; his early tolerance of attack ads without fighting back; his later decision to fight back with his own attack ads; his support of civil unions instead of full gay marriage; his speech to AIPAC; his vote on telecomm immunity; et al.)  Obama's genius is in realizing that not everybody thinks like him, yet they still need to be catered to.  In other words, Obama is so good at playing the game that a lot of politicians (and you) don't realize he's playing for the other side.

&gt; Whatever smarts he has simply isn't the kind that's good at figuring out complicated things, puzzles, technology, math, etc. His is about knowing how to manipulate people.

Exactly.  He is good at nuance; at reading motives and undercurrents and then nudging them ever-so-subtlely towards the direction of his own agenda.  Good, at least we're agreed on that.

&gt; But then, he doesn't strike me as a non-asshole.

*Really*??  Then who the hell *does* strike you as a non-asshole?  I think this is a case of try-as-he-might-he'll-never-be-able-to-please-you.  I dare you to name a single instance where he hasn't acted like a complete gentleman and professional, **ever**.  I just do not understand, and cannot explain this irrationally negative response that his character seems to engender in some people, except maybe to call it *prejudice*.  He is well-mannered, well-spoken, well-educated, and well-meaning (granted that you debate this).  Essentially, he's a mama's boy.

&gt; Pointless hopes of people who think they need to be inspired doesn't make the world better. Only real, substantive reform does that.

And how do *you* propose to carry out real, substantive reform without ""pointless hope""?  Reform can only come when people realize that things are bad.  Hope is just the further realization that they might be able to do something about it.  Obama is telling them that *they can do something about it*.

&gt; I don't believe in Jeebus, I don't believe in Santa Claus, and I don't believe in Obama.

I think you're confusing *belief* with *faith*.  I don't have any belief *or* faith in the majority of the selfish bastards who claim to run this country in our name.  I have plenty of concrete justification for my belief (and now, based on the evidence, faith) in Barack Obama. It's not like it's a bad thing to believe in something.  Your cynical mind simply likes to think that everyone is guilty before proven innocent.  That, like I said, is prejudice.

For that matter, I""d be voting for Ron Paul whether he were black, white, green, purple or any other color. His support of the Constitution is the reason I'm voting for Ron Paul via write-in vote if necessary this year. There is no other reason, and in fact I even disagree with Paul on a couple of issues, particularly abortion. If Barac Obmama stood for the same type of things Ron Paul does, Obama would have my vote, and donation, in a heartbeat - but you will never, ever, hear him say anything about eliminating the Federal Reserve or doing anything else that would diminish the influence of the Rockefeller's, the CFR, and Israeli Zionist's over our government.

Think of the 2 party system as a bucksaw.. they get some body to pull it far to the right, and somebody else to pull it back the other way... all the time cutting deeper and deeper through the tree of liberty and freedom but nobody notices because they carry on the illusion of opposing sides...without this back and forth motion the chance of revolt would increase.. think about it for a while..

To be brief:

I'm astounded that Barack could have attended his church for so long and not have known that Jeremiah Wright was ranting so ferociously.

And for Obama to break ties with him after so long, and after so much press coverage, smacks of insincerity, in either the relationship _en toto_ or in the separation.  (I'm not sure which).

"What you need to understand is that the two candidates are really not that different on a total political spectrum, with fascism on end right and communism on the end left. When you examine the political spectrum like this almost all candidates and politicians in america fall into the moderate category. In this microcosm of moderates you have mccain on the right , Hillary in middle and slight left and obama a bit further left than Hillary. If you examine this scale with only presidential candidates, which becomes the norm in political discussion, McCain is on the far right, Hillary is in the middle and Obama is arguably the most left and liberal of the political spectrum. 

In the most basic of answers that means that those in the democrats party who are more inclined to the center and right will vote for Hillary and if Hillary is gone that means they will lean towards McCain. 

Of course I am sure the real answer your looking for is based on race and age of the candidates and your right, its probably the biggest unmentioned factor in the this election. Forget all the issues, for many this will become a issue of racial thoughts and should a black man be president? 

There is also the issue of religion. Fox news calling obama a ""Muslim"" basically made McCain and Hillary more christian than obama and his radical ideas of hope and change. And  those Conservatives Christian groups know what power they have when they pick a candidate: they won it for bush in 00 and 04,as long as he was on side of Christianity thats all that mattered. 

That bridge you mentioned is alot shorter than you think for A Middle American mom who has never even seen a black person in real life. Though i can explain the rational reasons for this, it will be mostly irrational reasons that will make this leap. 

As for me, I would vote for mccain over hillary. Why? Her videogame legislation that will likely to happen if she ever was elected and if she stop getting lobbying money from the industry and bunch of other reasons. But ive always been long time supporter of mccain, especially when he was once could compared to Teddy Roosevelt, perhaps the greatest president. Alas 00 he made the mistake of being too moderate and he did not get support of Christian who went for Bush instead. So McCain became a true conservative to get nomination this time around.

"Over here in Flanders (= Belgium = Europe), things are different, yet similar.

Similar because we keep living with our parents longer &amp; longer too.
Different because most of us have more money and better jobs than our parents...

The main problem here atm is that housing/appartment prices are horribly high. Combined with the high intrest rates atm, it's pretty much impossible to buy something if you're single.
So in stead of renting an appartment (and pretty much throwing away 600-800 euros per month), we live with our parents a bit longer and save up some money.

Although i have to add that it's normal to live with our parents for a (in your perspective) long time. When we go to university/college, it's rarely more than a 30min drive from school to home (13.500km² and 6mil people, 4 major universities and plenty of colleges). So most stay at home, some rent a sort of student appartment (in dutch: ""kot"", tranlated it would probably be a ""shack""), but still go home every weekend.

So by the time we graduate we're 21-23 years old and still live at home (perfectly normal). Few of us have any money at that time, so we stay at home for a while to save up some money.

Single people stay at home a while longer, while couples will obviously want some more privacy (and have a larger combined income), so they'll move out quicker.

I'm now 26yo and still live at home (even though i have a great job). I graduated  2 years ago, but i blew all my money on a new car (fyi: mazda2) and by going out ... a lot.
About half my friends are living with their girl/boyfriends, the other half is single and lives at home.

I'll probably stay at home for another year, after which i'll either rent an appartment alone or with a roommate. I hate renting, because (like all belgians) i consider it to be money thrown away. But buying something is out of the question right now because the loan i'd need is impossible to pay on my own.
So i guess i'll rent untill the interest rates come down (ffs, choose obama or they'll probably go up!) and then i'll buy something.

"&gt; Trading that up for some corporate hook-ups and back-door deals would seem... rather stupid. And I think you at least must agree that Obama is anything but that.

He may not be stupid, but neither is he a genius. I'd almost definitely score higher than he would by a far margin, and even you I think have a 50/50 shot at outdoing him.

Whatever smarts he has simply isn't the kind that's good at figuring out complicated things, puzzles, technology, math, etc.

His is about knowing how to manipulate people.

However, I do dispute that it would seem rather stupid. What would he gain by acting saintly? Sure, a person like him enjoys the worship, but not as much as you might think. On the other hand, backroom deals, they seal power. Instead of only being in the spotlight for 4-8 years, he might gain a permanent seat in the halls of power somehow.

A mildly amusing pleasure of being worshipped, or true lasting power?

Of course, it would seem rather *assholish* of him (but not stupid). But then, he doesn't strike me as a non-asshole.

"This is a lot tougher than the regret one. There are a lot to choose from. Being at the county Democrats' victory party and hearing the election called for Obama after 16 hours on my feet Election Day volunteering was pretty awesome. I hugged lots of total strangers, I screamed, I cried, it was euphoric. Getting a hug from Dennis Kucinich during the DNC was a big high point, too. I'm a lifelong political junkie, so a lot of my happiest moments involve politics. Someday I'll answer a future incarnation of this post with, ""The day I was elected to Congress,"" but I'll have a different Reddit login so that nobody can look through my pervy/weird/gross comments.

But really, I think that I have to say the moment my puppy was born takes the cake. I missed my own 18th birthday party because his mother went into labor and I wanted to be there to see the puppies born.

I was helping to deliver the litter, and the fifth pup of seven presented as a breech baby, was very large, and burst his air bubble before his head was delivered. When he arrived, he wouldn't breathe or move-- he'd been without air for a little too long. My Godmother (see: regret thread) was able to get him to start breathing after a few very tense minutes of sucking the fluid from his lungs with a device made for that purpose, and then when he opened his mouth and made his first little, ""Awwwwp?"" noise, he was mine instantly.

I had not planned to ask for a puppy from the litter. I just wanted the experience of delivering baby doggies. I'd seen cats, lambs, goat kids, and horses born before, but never dogs. But Gus was mine whether I asked for him or not. He's like a canine soulmate. I sacrificed a lot to be able to keep him, but he's still with me now and it's so totally worth it. 

Yeah, he's ""just a dog,"" but he is always there, always happy to see me, appreciates the love and attention I give him, exercises with me, fetches a ball all day, and even mimics a few human words. I think that last bit is because he has been with me from birth and sort of thinks of himself as more human than dog. My father says of his granddog, ""It's more like having a retarded grandchild than a smart dog.""

And when (again, see: regret thread) my Godmother passed away later that year, Gus was what got me through it. I don't grieve well. At all. And I distrust shrinks, because there are many of them in my family and they don't really seem any more functional than anyone else, so I doubt their ability to help fix my problems. I felt like the rug was yanked out from under my entire worldview, and with it being the year I turned 18, I was sure it was a sign that my childhood (which was pretty happy, really) was over and adult life was just going to suck and be one miserable march toward death and taxes.

But warm puppy cuddles do a whole lot of good for a whole lot of problems, and Gus developed a habit which he still has today: Whenever he recognized that I was getting depressed and starting to feel self-destructive, he would come over and set his head on my foot and give a big, heavy sigh. Coming from a tiny fluffy puppy, that was always enough to make me giggle.",4

Both black and white participants who focused on a positive black person everyday had less negative stereotypes about black people than before. The conclusion is that by exposing ourselves to positive examples, we can alter our subconscious stereotypes.

If Obama is president, this could provide millions of people (especially children) with a positive image and go a long way to change race relations. Certainly, some people will not change, but this has to be one step closer to MLK's dream.

I agree that people are generally only principled when it is convenient to be (or to claim that they are) but, i don't necessarily find it to be as profound of a point as some others did.

"Well then, why are you trying to pick at Obama's negatives if you are trying to make sure he's the one to vote for? You've read much of the presented ""negatives"" that have stood out in the media -- the Rezko deal and his pastor's speeches. He's also earmarked a lot more bills than McCain (but not as much as Hillary).

From what I've gathered, he has very strong positives, and all of that outweighs the supposed negatives. 

I've had small debates with some of my friends who are Clinton supporters (true liberals, too), who just think Obama doesn't have the ""experience"" to put together a broad coalition to bring change to the White House. I, though, think that Clinton wouldn't bring true change to the White House, and a lot of Obama's policies and thoughts are more up my alley.

If anything, I would say that Obama's slightly too left-leaning for the rest of the United States. He is more liberal than Hillary, but not as liberal as Kucinich. I do think he can put that behind his back and build a good coalition to bring real change (technologically, in education, in energy, and infrastructure).

As for positives, I could go on and on, but the most important things to me are his stances on education and technology (more forward thinking than Hillary or McCain), his ability to be viewed as an intelligent figurehead by the rest of the world (we need to do some cleanup after Bush), and his vote on the war in Iraq.

&gt;To suggest for a second that anyone is in this country should give up their right to participate because they're not in love with either of the cadidates is incredibly foolish. If everyone waits around to vote for a candidate that they think is perfect we will end up with people like Sarah Palin running our country.

I didn't suggest anyone give up any rights, in fact, I'm for more personal rights which is why I can't support McCain or Obama. There are no perfect candidates and never will be. And are you suggesting Palin is perfect? Why even mention her?

&gt;You could even suggest that if everyone who thought their vote didn't count in 2000 and 2004 voted, we probably would'n't be in Iraq right now, would've caught Bin Lauden and who knows what else.

You really think that the voting machines are legit and secure? You honestly believe that if the people that didn't vote in '00 &amp; '04 did vote that things would be any different? Bush lost and still won. I guess it's nice to hope so.

&gt;Can we really afford to take ANY chances in this THIRD time around. This may very possibly be our last chance.

Third time? What are you talking about? Republicans and Democrats are NOT the answer and nobody else is going to win. You can hope for Change and all that good stuff, but shifting troops from Iraq to Afghanistan is NOT Change I can believe in.

"Bill Clinton was raised poor in Hope, Arkansas.  Went to Yale and Georgetown, become Governor and President.  Sorry, but Yale and Georgetown define ""Ruling Elite"" in the USA.    

Reagan wasn't ruling elite until he was a successful actor in Hollywood, and cemented the deal as a member of the ruling elite when he become head of the screen actors guild.  Later Gov and President. 

As FullOfSheeple said about Obama:

&gt;Obama went to the most elite private high school in Hawai'i. His birth father went to Harvard for his PhD. Obama started out at Occidental College, transferred to Columbia, then later on went to Harvard Law School, where he was elected president of the Law Review. He is without any doubt a member of the ruling elite.

Add in that he a US Senator!  Really, probably the most elite club on the fucking planet.  

These are all definitions of a member of the ruling elite of the United States.  So, if you met more than one or two of those... then, yes... you are a member of the ruling elite.  Weather you understand that fact or not is not really relevant.   

One of the things the tools the ruling elite use to expand their own ranks are scholarships to elite Universities like Harvard, Yale, Columbia... Ivy League schools and some equivalent rank ones (MIT, Stanford, etc.)  

This is probably one of the weird but good things about the modern world.  The ruling elite now expand their ranks via more than personal sexual reproduction.  If they see somebody they like not already a member -- who probably isn't going to try to kill them all in a Revolution -- they are more than happy to invite them into the club house and show the non-elites how nice they really are -- basic public relations 101.  

Of course, this doesn't stop their other activities... running the world, etc.  Most of them don't see the contradiction because it's not in their own self-interest to notice it, and those who do see the contradiction really don't want to do anything about it cause they like things that way. ",1

Wears a flannel shirt that is at least three sizes too large and the same greenish Dickies to work every day.

I would say that he probably has the conversational skills of a seven year old.  There are constant pauses which are always followed by an awkward ""yeeeeeep!""  When trying to sound intelligent he constantly repeats the phrases ""I do believe"" and ""Yes, it is so.""  He also likes to start the majority of his sentences with ""Is what I think it is is....""

Now we'll get to the personality.  I'm convinced he only bathes once per week.  By Friday, his stench is overpowering and you cannot stand to talk to him for more than a couple seconds.  His beverage of choice is Bud Light and he jumps at the opportunity to get anything for free.  He was reprimanded at work for trying to smuggle eleven free snack sized bags of potato chips from a vendor display, on a business trip, we received free drink coupons upon arrival to the hotel and he asked all twenty of us for our coupons.  He was telling us about his ""sweet 46"" plasma screen flat panel LCD monitor"" that he has which he uses ""to talk to people on Yahoo chat, mannnn.""

The most recent, and I'd say most astonishing thing was when two days after Obama was elected he didn't even have the slightest clue that there was even an election, and when he heard the news he went around the office telling everyone that Obama was elected.  A few minutes later I heard him on the phone; ""Yeah man, Obama is a democrat, I hear that they're like really good with that economy shit.  As far as I know **this is the first time that we have ever had a democrat as president.**""

There is plenty more, but I'll spare you additional reading.

I have a family member in the military who thinks he's(Obama) a Muslim too.  Actually I don't think he really thinks he's a Muslim I just think he's joining *some of* the republican crowd or maybe he really does believe that and in that case he's just ignorant.  I told him that's prejudice and why would it even matter if he was Muslim?  I don't care what religion my president is as long as they did a good job.  Then again is it really possible to keep religion out of politics?  Maybe we should just elect all Atheists.  It's unfortunate the US seems to identify itself with a certain religion anyways.  Religion needs to stay out of politics.,2

Biden is another true patriot (He sure ACTs like one! Get it? PARTIOT ACT?! LOL!). He voted for the war, draconian drug laws (Tommy Chong once remarked that Joe Biden was responsible for putting him in prison), and strict copyright laws which would put you in federal prison for 5 years for copying a DVD to your iPod.",-1

Because Obama will win next year and not Ron Paul.,1
"It is a strange demographic thing. Ron Paul is a libertarian-esque candidate, so you'd think he wouldn't pull many people away from Obama. Then again, his base is quite disgruntled with the GOP in general and is younger than average, both characteristics of Obama's base.

It'd be interesting to see how that would play out.",3
"can you provide a link, because I don't remember this ever happening

Also, Obama already said he'd pay off her campaign debt",0
"In some ways it breaks down the perceptions of success, as the Times points out.  But in other ways, Obama becomes a highly visible scapegoat for racists and race-card-pullers alike.  For every misstep (and there will be some, it happens to every president), you'll have racists who will say/think ""see, a black man can't run this country"" and blind supporters who will say/think ""how dare you criticize this misstep, you're a racist!""  It's already been that way during the campaign, but it's easier to disguise as part of the campaign process.

Overall I still think it will be a net positive for race relations because of the barriers it breaks.  But I still think we could be in for some choppy waters before all is said and done.",3

"&gt; A similar question was posed by Obama fans to Ron Paul supporters a few months ago. I was just checking to see how they themselves react to that question.

Just because Paul supporters could support Obama doesn't mean Obama supporters should support Paul.

&gt;So, positions don't matter? 

Um, Paul's positions would be exactly why I wouldn't vote for him. Public goods are something I'm not ready to give up. *Roe* is not a decision  I want overturned. Saying you want freedom while taking away a woman's right to choose is worse than any of the lies Clinton has told.

&gt;Character and integrity don't matter? A lying, cheating neo-conservative who wants to obliterate another country that doesn't attack us, is your choice? 

Character and integrity matter. That's (one reason) why I voted for Obama. But at some point, you have to make a compromise. I'd rather have someone embellish a bit to get into office than someone with Paul's libertarian perspective.

&gt;Is that because your religion, I mean your party, tells you to vote so? I am just curious about the reasons why. 

I think I've stated my reasons above. I'm not sure why voting for someone closer to my political leanings (while not exactly the same as mine) over someone almost diametrically opposed is considered doing something because my party tells me to.

&gt;So, all this ""Fuck you, &lt;State name&gt;"" is just for show.

I voted that story down. Maybe I'm not your target audience.

&gt;""Popular route on reddit""? LOL. Look at the number of points for this topic.

Just because one meta-story isn't popular doesn't mean that Ron Paul isn't the popular choice here on Reddit. Paul does really well with the conspiracy theorist demographic.",1
"As someone who was part of the Paul campaign, and now an Obama supporter, yes, yes it is. 

It was cool to see Paul pick up some speed in his primary attempt, as well as tell off Giuliani and McCain. It was fun to be on the ground in a month in New Hampshire, even meeting the guy. 

As for Obama, from a purely political standpoint, it's been interesting essentially watching him fight two hard races. I don't like Hillary at all, and I don't like McCain at all. 

Actually, I've sort of gone from libertarian, to a moderate skeptic. I would still vote Paul in a heartbeat.

Hopefully Obama will win. I bet he'll do something new and crazy in the time between election and inauguration. It sounds corny, but I think he's somewhat what the country needs now.

It might not be such a bad idea to let stories be cross posted to multiple subreddits at once, and then allow people to up or downvote tags (all the non-politics people could just block anything that's cros posted to the ""obama"" subreddit) for what shows up on their main page, and subreddits could either be for a single ""tag"", or for multiple tags.

I rationalized those away because I know he's a thoughtful man with a deep respect for the Constitution.  For religion (Xmas, abortion, etc.), I knew he'd put separation of church and state first.  With regards to abruptly reverting to the gold standard and abolishing federal agencies, I figured they'd never get passed and he'd be a good counterbalance to Congress.

Always, I knew he wasn't presidential material.
Much as I respect his central ideology and his integrity, he'd be a lame laughingstock if he made it to the White House.

Now, Hillary's pretty much dead.  Obama *is* presidential material.  My throwaway votes before have been mitigated by a disbelief that anything will change -- same old Republicrat bullshit.

There's one thing Obama *can* change, for the better, and that's the *face* of America.  A bright, intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate leader for our country -- something we haven't had for a long time.  I'm not for catering to world opinion, but it's obviously not a good thing for the world to hate you.

"I agree with your sentiment, but disagree with your conclusion, ""hanging the Constitution to make it at least theoretically possible would be a good step in the right direction"".  Perhaps it is because I cannot imagine a change that would be effective without creating some kind of totalitarian regime (thus eliminating the effect while purporting to ""establish"" it).

As it stands, the main reason, as I see it, for Americans not electing an atheist, et al, is because the *American people* do not want them.  No religious test is permissible by law, but if the people generally prefer to test their politicians on that standard, it is perfectly within their right to do so.

Within government, atheism seems impossible to accept, but what *really* would matter is if the atheist leader had any real or imagined *power*; they would certainly lose if atheism itself was/became their talking point, mainly because the people would prefer to be assured that their leader was looking out for their pocketbooks and their security.

Darwin is overrated.  Even though his theory of evolution was of monumental importance, he was nowhere near the best or most important scientist of his age.  If he hadn't discovered evolution, it would have been quickly worked out by someone else.

Obama is an average politician who has gotten by on charismatic speeches which are often devoid of any real substance.  I wish him well, but anybody with any real convictions could never last in the Democratic party, let alone get a shot at presidency.

Ron Paul is, racist, a creationist, and an isolationist.  OK, so he's right about a lot of things, but that doesn't mean that he's not a nut and a small-minded bigot.

Randall Monroe trades in geeky in-jokes, but when you strip away the computer references, his cartoons are rarely any more amusing than Garfield.

Richard Dawkins has elected himself as the voice of reason and science, but in reality, the number of scientists who agree with his arguments is smaller than he would have you think.

Keith Olbermann is a polemicist- which is fine, but what's he doing presenting a news show?  I don't need to be told when to be outraged when watching the news.  I can form my own opinions.

John Stewart is an elevated chat-show host.  He's more in the tradition of Jay Leno than Bill Hicks.

Penn and Teller used to be funny for about 10 minutes 20 years ago.  OK, we get it- the big guy shouts a lot and the little guy doesn't speak.  Oh- and you're not cutting edge just because you end a perfectly standard magic trick with some fake blood.

Al Gore became the environment's greatest defender *after* he lost an election to a chimpanzee.  He only developed convictions when he had no votes left to lose.

"Ask Reddit: Could Reddit please allow a proper filtering/priority system for stories?

I live in Australia. As such my interests range from the best model of Kangaroo to drive to work and who is currently wining the cricket (I joke, cricket is lame) But I digress.

Would it be possible to allow a system wherein a user (say an Australian user of exceptional good looks - me for eg) could apply a filter either by 

1) Keyword (-Obama -McCain -Palin -Maverick)
2) Priority (priority to given subreddits - stories are more likely to appear on the front page/subsequent pages if set)
3) Friend's stories (appear more often)

I am thinking of a kind of Facebook wall-like filter system which allows a user to control which content he/she views.

&lt;rant&gt;
Since no one appears to be using /r/politics/ or /r/Obama/ preferring instead to dump their stories about how Sarah Palin winks weird and may or may not be a 'Mavrick' or how Obama is ""the Man"" in the main section - perhaps it is time for a no junkmail sticker for those of use who just want the freedom to be able to browse the place without finding out which colour underpants Sarah Palin is wearing on any given day. &lt;/rant&gt;


I put the question before my fellow redditors who will likely (among other things) tell me that this idea has already been posted, I need to eat more Bacon and that American culture is the best , so just accept your fate - but I am hoping for a few genuine responses of why reddit should not become another Digg.",1

Okay. Really quickly.

_An anarcho-capitalist would argue that these things would be provided by the market. Although I disagree with this point as far as the police are concerned, ask yourself how much of the federal budget goes to your local police force, and the answer is NONE!_

I'm not an anarcho capitalist, and I disagree rather vehemently with them. How do you disagree about my point? And the federal budget absolutely needs considerable trimming, but either way, I'd still be paying local taxes at the very least.

_This is just plain WRONG. How did Halliburton do during the Bush administration? Politicians like to hand out government contracts to their friends companies._

Halliburton didn't start off currying to political favors, though. It began as a legitimate company. And my question was: what is the solution to a problem like Halliburton's? Stricter regulation? I think that might work quite well - but that means that you're adding more layers of red tape, which you're against (I think).

_I think you are mistaken that Obama wants to reduce government. While he may have taken a stance against the war, he campaigned on a platform which included the government getting involved in healthcare. Yea... he's all about shrinking government._

I think that healthcare should be controlled by the government. I think, however, that other parts of the government need to be trimmed, and that's something that Obama supports. I used the word ""streamlining"" before, and that's what he's talked about: making the government actually operate with some efficiency.

"For me, Biden has quite a few things I don't agree with [at ALL] and Palin has a few, but Biden's have done a lot more damage.  Overall though, I am not voting for a VP, I'm voting for a president, and their choice of VP tells a lot about their decision making capabilities.

Biden is strong on foreign politics, but favorable of current drug laws.  Obama, from what I know, is against the current drug laws.  I don't even know what to say about Palin's capabilities.

"actually, i remember a LOT of people at the time telling me that there was no difference between Bush and Gore so they either didn't vote or they voted for Nader.

Never forget that the Republican core will ALWAYS vote in a block.  Gun's n' Jesus n' Creationlism n' BigBiz, yeeehaww...  They are NOT liberal thinkers.  Liberal thinkers have to try to come together to agree on something or else you are going to get the default: NeoCons.

A perfect example:  Republicans have already picked their guy flat out and the republican base has rallied behind McCain.  So while democrats are shooting themselves in the foot with the Hillary vs. Obama thing the Republicans are gaining momentum with McCain.  It's part of the party doctrin.  Unite behind your guy for the good of the party.

If you would like to see liberal and democratic values at the presidential level you have to unite behind the party and not ""sit this one out""  Politics is a team effort.  Even if you don't agree with them completly consider which of them is most likely to be a close aproximation of what you would like.  If the answer is ""none, i hate them all""  then ask yourself.  Which of them would leave the country in a state where you would expect that in the next election your ideas would be closer to center or further to margin.

I want transparent government, civil liberties, sane monitary policy, and no war, I'd also like to see pot legalized, the income tax repealed, and prostitution legalized, help the environment too.  With Obama I don't expect to get all of that but what I do see is that with Obama i would get:  transparent government, sane monitary policy, civil liberties improved, no war.  I don't expect to see pot legalized, but perhaps decriminalized.  I don't expect to see prostitution legalized.  I don't expect the IRS to go away either.  But with an Obama presidency I think the field will be set for the future where things like marijuana legalization and income tax reform can be issues that are brought to the front of future presidential campaigns.

With McCain i can expect to see more war and reckless spending... no chance in hell of civil liberties being restored and very secretive government.  Under McCain it would go farther away from my hopes of marijuana legalization and income tax reform, prostitution, while used most often by republicans, would continue to remain illegal and be less of a debatable issue.

See... it matters who you vote for because you are setting the country down a path that may not be perfectly exactly what you hope for but it opens doorways along that path that lead to things that you might want to see happen.  One path leads closer to your ideals the other path leads farther away.

I think that might work quite well - but that means that you're adding more layers of red tape, which you're against (I think).""

You are correct that Halliburton didn't start off currying political favors, but there are many examples of similar behavior throughout history. For example, when the railroads were first being built, many politically connected companies asked for subsidies to build them because they were ""important to the infrastructure of the country"" (or something along those lines) They ended up getting subsidies per miles of track they built which caused them to build poorly constructed zig zagged track. Not only did these subsidies make it hard for non politically connected companies to compete, but they resulted in a product that would never have been able to exist in a free market. These practices would have been seen as wasteful. The point I'm trying to makes is that when government decides it is going to fund something, they are taking away the profit loss mechanism that makes capitalism work, they prevent non politically connected competitors from entering the market, they usually end up with an inferior product, and they are taking away my right to vote for or against the company with my money. One of my professors often quipped - government cannot create wealth, it can only transfer wealth from person a to person b. While that statement isn't 100% true (for example, I think some government funded scientific research helps to create wealth in the long run) it is quite poignant. 

---------------------------------------------

""I think that healthcare should be controlled by the government. I think, however, that other parts of the government need to be trimmed, and that's something that Obama supports. I used the word ""streamlining"" before, and that's what he's talked about: making the government actually operate with some efficiency.""

I would personally benefit from healthcare controlled by government, and I think one could make the argument that public health is a public good. Public goods are goods which are not provided at the correct level by the market and thus an argument can be made for their funding by government. For example, if half the population has an easily communicable disease that could be treated if they had the money, then that affects me and everyone else... yada yada yada. 

---------------------------------------------

It sounds like we agree on quite a few issues and are splitting hairs. I do not consider myself anarcho capitalist, and even if it would work I don't think there are any steps we could take to create a truly anarcho capitalist society.

I think the thing that I said which we truly disagreed on was that taxes propped up a ruling class. What I meant by that is that even if the taxes are meant to provide public services, they are often delegated to private companies who make huge profits when they shouldn't be. The CEOs, CFOs and other executives of these companies, who often arrive at their positions through connections rather than hard work, get millions of dollars in bonuses which put their progeny in the same position. (rich neighborhoods, country clubs, the prep school -&gt; ivy league -&gt; board appointed executive position route) I think many of the companies in the military industrial complex show this pattern and are a drain on the rest of the economy. (I don't think I worded this very well nor do I think it strikes at the heart of what I'm getting at.... oh well)

The other way in which political entrepreneurs gain advantages is through regulation. While the intent of regulation may be pure and practical, most often regulations end up becoming barriers to entry for others who wish to compete in an industry. These barriers to entry create government sanctioned monopolies over industries. ex: taxicabs, liquor stores, prescription drug companies, etc

The capture theory of regulation works like this: Companies that the regulation affects have millions or even billions of dollars on the line. They have quite a bit of money to throw around and huge incentives to affect the development of regulations. Most individuals have very little incentive to care at all about   any of these particular regulations. So you end up with the affected companies spending a ton of money on changing the regulations to benefit themselves and very little on the opposing side. The regulations end up growing around the companies and not the other way around. 
(This theory probably explains why we saw deregulation in the case of credit default swaps)

"Ok - a few simple points

1.  The Iraq war's goal is destabilization of the Middle East, designed to make sure that no single power there grows strong enough to challenge oil companies' control of profits.  It also was supposed to give us a permanent military presence in Iraq, a very useful location, and so far, it has worked.

2.  Bush passed a LOT of bills related to ""stopping terrorism"".  He also did a lot of shady things (Gitmo, prisoners on boats, waterboarding, etc) to prevent attacks on American soil.  We all regard this as absolute bullshit, but what if the next president (say Obama) stops doing this and multiple attacks happen on American soil?  Who will look like the better president?

3.  Rescuing Bear Stearns prevented a massive economic downturn.  The printing of vast amounts of cash (to shore up credit) did cause temporary oil and commodities inflation, but in the long term, it also prevented a massive depression.

4.  Fling poo.

I don't believe any of this, but I'd lying (as a liberal Democrat) if I said there was no probability that at least ONE of these might, in fact, be true.

Note how I've ignored the death toll in Iraq, the massive wealth gap in the US, the actual recession, the deficit, the absolutely TERRIBLE precedent that rescuing Bear Stearns (or rather handing it to Tony Blair - or did you not know this?) set, torture, flagrant violations of international law, and at least one stolen US election.

"Yes, and I think many others would, even the most ardent Obama supporter.

However, in the real world it isn't always cut and dry. If people were presented with clear proof, they might, but the process to get that clear proof would be muddied with foot dragging.

Then, the people who support Obama and *would* cheat to win would feed the honest-but-cautious-about-Republican-claims crowd talking points to further muddy up matters. 

I think people assume sources like Fox News or Drudge *all bullshit*, by virtue of the amount of bullshit they put out. This would mean they would ignore any point they make, even if said point happens to be salient.

What's clear is that the majority of the Hillary-to-Mccain jumpers are white, are clearly working against their best interest by voting Republican, and yet they're doing it anyway. The Obama supporters would still be better off supporting him even if he was just another white candidate.

What Washington needs is for a grown-up to sit it down and tell it that it can no longer misbehave... because from now on, it's being watched.  This is exactly what Obama plans to do, and he means to do it by promoting transparency in government; by holding every move that Congress makes up to public scrutiny.

Budget &amp; economy: Totally fucked, nothing either one can do about it, with or without the full cooperation of Congress. I recommend explosive locking collars put around the necks of all legislators and the president, set to go off if they can't agree on a balanced budget by the end of the fiscal year (plus a little more than balanced until debt's paid off). McCain and Obama both get an F--- (triple minus) on this issue.

Civil rights: Fix everything else, this will fix itself. McCain gets an F-, Obama gets an F--- for the anticipated backstabbing we'll get when he wins.

Corporations: Shouldn't exist. Repeal corporate personhood. If this makes big businesses impossible, all the better. If they exist in any form afterward, any restriction the people wish to place on them is fine and inarguable... no free speech so they can't advertise, etc. Both get an F-(x20) on this one.

Crime: Real crime is overshadowed by ridiculous wars on X (drugs, etc). Little need be done here, that's not already being done. Both candidates get a ""meh"".

Drugs: Legalize heroin. Make it illegal to produce them without a license if they're chemically synthesized. Restrict access to those above 18. Do no decriminalize, this is a pussy measure, designed to give the illusion of reform while allowing them to backtrack whenever convenient. McCain gets an F-, Obama gets an F--- for paying lip service.

Education: Not a job for the government. Abolish public school, subsidize parents if you feel like it. Once the government can't indoctrinate children anymore, maybe they'll get it through their head that it's none of their business to do such.

Energy &amp; Oil: Crash course in fusion. Ramp up production of safe/new fission reactor production. Burn what fossil fuels we have to until those come online.

Environment: Meh.

Families &amp; Children: Why the fuck would this be an issue for government? Are we electing presidents and congressmen here, or nannies and parents?

Foreign Policy: We shouldn't have any. Military restricted to patroling our coasts at up to 200 miles by sea, soldiers never step foot on foreign soil.

Free trade: We don't need free trade, we need to be able to produce the things we need locally.

Reform: Will never be any such thing, people talking about it are often just hoping their faction will come to power. 

Gun Control: Calibers larger than 50mm should be illegal to own by civilians. $20 license fee on automatic weapons is reasonable, no matter what the gun nuts say.

Health care: Not something the government should do. If they can't do the simple things we ask, do you really want them sticking their nose into when and how you will undergo surgery? If you think you can't afford it, either you can't or your purchasing decisions were bad and you're inflating the price.

Homeland security: No-appeals execution of all who work for the department, abolish it with constitutional ammendment, spin off those agencies we need again (Customs).

Immigration: Mexican and central american immigrants can come to a border office with $2000 cash plus $500 per dependents, and all paperwork they have. Need to prove they have a trade, that they've committed no serious felonies in the past 15 years, and that they carry no communicable diseases. If these conditions are met, after at most a 2 hour interview, they are guided to a city of our choice. Housing and job assistance provided. Up to 300,000 a year. Illegal immigrants who have committed no other crimes are deported, and eligible to participate in new immigration program within 18 months.

Technology: Not the government's job.

Infrastructure: Roads and bridges should become private. This is what has led to the hundreds of millions of cars on the road, and what has caused our energy and environmental problems. Quit subsidizing destructive behavior.

Jobs: Not the government's problem, and when it starts doing other things right, this will correct itself. With no national debt, our economy would be doing well, we'd see more investment here than abroad.

Principles and values? What the fuck?

Social Security: A disaster. Need a way to wean younger payers off of it, while not forcing grandma and grandpa to eat catfood.

Tax reform: More bullshit from the candidates, a smokescreen.

War &amp; peace: Until our nation is attacked by a state actor (terrorism doesn't count), our soldiers shouldn't fire a single shot.

Welfare &amp; poverty: Welfare is designed to keep people in poverty. Fix the other problems we have, and we won't be able to afford to allow people to be idle, we'll be begging and offering incentives for them to work, even if they have to be trained first.",-2

If you're talking to this Obama crowd that allegedly thinks that he does no wrong, then that is a different matter, and I should not be responding.  I'll note however that I've never run into someone who actually thinks this way, and that I have a strong suspicion that they don't exist.  Some of the manipulations that I've seen suggest that this alleged group is little more than a straw-man built by people with a transparent agenda.

In some cases that agenda seems to be that they support another candidate and would like to portray any Obama supporter as one having blind unquestioning allegiance to his stand on any number of issues in order to imply that any rational-minded person should want to disassociate themselves with Obama as a candidate altogether.

In other cases (and more frequently on reddit) it seems that the agenda is an arrogant and aimless dissent that takes a self-righteous pride in raising points of contention to imply that they have some great insight that others lack (see: WAKE UP SHEEPLE.)  These points are usually either obvious or ludicrous, and usually polarize an argument as being black and white, and insisting that anyone claiming ""gray"" is a hypocrite or a fool.

"**PART 4**

  10. Because of his tax proposals?  Joe Biden said the rich should be “patriotic” and be willing to be taxed at higher rates.   Currently the top 1% of income earners pays 37% of our income taxes.  The top 10% pay 2/3 of our taxes.  The bottom 50% only pays 3%.  About 38- 40% pay no taxes.  So how do 95% of us come out with fewer taxes in an Obama presidency?  Perhaps America would be stronger if we all could be a little bit “patriotic”, instead of hiring a government to redistribute the nation’s wealth?  How about capital gains taxes?  Obama has stated he would increase capital gains taxes on investments from 15% to 28%.  History shows the nation’s revenue strongly increases when capital gains taxes are cut, and vice versa.  If Obama is elected, expect a huge sell-off of investments before he can change the law.  Social security taxes will no longer be capped at $102,000 of income.  Taxes on dividends  would increase from 15% to 30%.  Over half of Americans have some investments, plus retirement plans.  Corporate taxation  sounds good, but corporations do not pay tax – they simply adjust their prices so we pay their taxes for them.   Already, many companies (jobs) and huge amounts of capital have left our shores due to high taxation.  Obama pledged to cut taxes when he ran for the U.S. Senate, but has voted for increased taxes or against tax cuts 90+ times.  He says he will cut programs that are not needed in order to find the money he needs for his agenda.  If he does, he will be the first politician (especially in his party) in known history to keep that promise.  He will also have to effectively buck his own party, an action for which he has no precedent. 
  11. Because he is transparent?  It is extremely difficult to get information about his past.  His college records are sealed at Occidental College, Columbia University and Harvard.  We cannot get access to his Theses.  It is reported that he did write on the Soviet Union and Disarmament???  We don’t know about his associations or how he paid for his expensive schooling.  There is a lawsuit, brought by Phillip Berg, a lifelong and active Democrat, that claims he is not a natural born citizen, and therefore ineligible for the presidency.  His Kenyan grandmother talks about being in the delivery room when he was born in Kenya, while Obama and his sister recall two different hospitals in Hawaii where he claims to have been born.  He was registered for school in Indonesia, where he attended for five years, as an Indonesian citizen and a Muslim.  Indonesia did not recognize dual citizenship.  If he is a natural born citizen it seems he would release the documentation to authenticate his claims, particularly since this story seems to be gaining momentum.  At least one of his available birth documents has Adobe references, and is therefore suspect. 
  12. Because of his proposed agenda (If he has the House and Senate, as well as the executive branch, it could happen very quickly)?
         1. Expand the inheritance tax
         2. Weaken the Patriot Act
         3. Weaken the military
         4. Curb anti-terror wire-tapping
         5. Extend health and social security benefits to illegal immigrants
         6. Provide in-state tuition to children of illegal immigrants
         7. Increase the number of illegal immigrants allowed into the U.S.
         8. Weaken education standards
         9. Expand health costs and force rationing of medical services (especially to the elderly)
        10. Pass a bill to fund the fight against global poverty (Obama wrote and sponsored the Global Poverty Act (S. 2433) which calls for  the US to spend 0.7 percent of our gross national product on foreign aid, which amounts to a phenomenal 13-year total of $845 billion over and above what the US already spends.
        11. Pass The Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA), which will set aside all the pro-life gains since Roe v. Wade.  He famously said he would not want his daughters to be punished with a baby if they were to become pregnant.
        12. Repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as being exclusively between one man and one woman.  It currently permits states to not honor any same-sex marriage performed in another state. 
        13. Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) is similar to the Civil Rights Act, except it pertains to sexual orientation.  The sponsors have removed “transgender” (for now); as ENDA narrowly failed to pass by 50-49 on previous tries.
        14. Hate Crime Legislation.  This should provide ample incentives for criminals to attack only elderly, heterosexual Caucasians to avoid the bonus penalties (a bit of sarcasm).
        15. If we are fortunate, we can keep our guns.  Obama said, “We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measures that I think respects the Second Amendment and people’s traditions. “  Maybe if we register our guns – the first step in taking our guns – and solemnly promise not to ever shoot them (There I go again, being sarcastic).
        16. And don’t forget the socialist agenda:  “From each according to ability, to each according to his needs”. 
        17. Driver licenses for illegal aliens (what part of “illegal” does he struggle with?)  I think 7 of the 9/11 terrorists had drivers licenses.  Driver’s licenses can be used for identification, including at the voting place.
        18. Supports human cloning.  Remember Dolly, the sheep that was cloned?  Its cloned offspring only lived three years, because its DNA started out as 6-year old DNA by the time it was born.  Other cloned animals have not had a good track record and have suffered early and often unpleasant deaths.
        19. Obama supports 1) homosexual education for very young students, 2) judges who are not strict constructionists, 3) transporting minor girls across state lines to receive abortions, 4) legislation requiring business to favor homosexuals, 5) Gay Pride Celebrations.
        20. Obama opposes 1) Traditional marriage, 2) drilling for oil, 3) protecting live babies that result from botched abortions, 4) parental rights in education.
        21. Appoint 2-3 activist judges to the Supreme Court, plus replacing George Bush’s many nominations, that can’t get an up or down vote in the Senate, with his own selections.
        22. Implement the “Fairness Doctrine” for talk radio, which will seriously curtail conservative talk radio.  The liberal talk radio shows have consistently failed, even when heavily subsidized.  Note that MSM, Internet and other outlets that favor the left are not targets of “fairness”.  Controlling the message that reaches the voters will be virtually complete, thus helping perpetuate the politics of the left.

 

Well that’s it!!  I know I could do better if I had more time and talent, but I hope this is effective enough to make my case.  I wish I could share this with a lot of people who don’t have the time or interest to check out the candidate of “change” and hope. 

Obama has said this is a great country. He also wants to change it!!  Maybe we should listen.

Compared that to Sarah Palin, who stood up to the Federal Government and refused to implement the national ID card in Alaska and has spoken kindly about the issue of Jury Nullification. 

THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, but after 8 years of Bush I don't think our civil liberties would survive 4 years of Biden. I would vote for Palin over Biden in a heartbeat because that issue is important to me.

"I had a couple of Obama dreams, both a little weird.

The first one, I had somehow gotten my way into a political convention, and I was in the box seat with Obama.  We were talking about existentialism and the philosophy of living and how it plays into the American spirit, and he had his arm around my shoulder and he was sort of coming off as a father figure (my parents divorced when I was 1, I only had a mother growing up).  And then some horribly grotesque nazi-science-experiment-ish entertainment came into the convention.  Women who were unnaturally 9 feet tall, bones and tendons raw and sewn together, a circus of flesh and nightmare.  All the oligarchs were laughing and having a hell of a sadistic time watching these meat puppets try to get around, but I covered my face with my hands because I knew the horror was too much for me.  Shortly after I woke up.

And just a week ago or so I had a dream that I was back in my childhood home, and I really wanted to get away from home, so I hopped on a bicycle.  Eerily enough, all the streets were empty, and I rode by Obama helping his daughter tie her shoe.  I was like ""Hey! Obama!""  and I doubled back around because I wanted to talk to him, but I was stopped by a secret service person and he was giving me the ""You need to come with me"" jab and then it turned into a Kafka-esque nightmare of being considered a terrorist for being too close to Obama.

"The question was, 
&gt;So, why would someone supporting Clinton say they will vote for McCain if she loses the nomination?

Obviously Racisim isn't the only reason....but having grown up in Texas ... I know the most obvious reason will be racism. 

Conservative, or undereducated hispanics and whites that would have supported Hillary will not support Obama because of skin color. The whisper campaigns about Obama being a closet muslim who went to a radical madrasah  don't get laughed at as they do in most places. They're encouraged and bolstered by emails from multiple sources. ""Did you hear?""...""Oh yes I heard.""....""My brother in law sent me an email...I got a flyer in the mail...the ladies at the club were passing around a flyer."" I've heard and seen all these things. 

So I'm convinced racisim will be the leading reason as to which Hillary voters do and do not vote for Obama.",8
"Here's the original message from her:

""At this point in time I support Hilary Clinton.

My main ""selling point"" has always been ""pro-choice/pro-life"" up until resent when I had my eyes opened to a nother possibility........the draft.

Since I have two boys, one that is not that far off of 18, this is a serious problem for me. It strikes a fear so deep in me I can't even explain. I told &lt;husband&gt; I would commit a mass-murder/suicide of our whole family before I let anyone send my boys off to war.....I don't think I was kidding when I said it either.

That being said...I do not trust Obama one bit and I am shock that some mant people have the cover pulled over their eyes to him. I see right through him. He is a Muslim.....and I believe he is the first step to ""taking America down"" from the inside out. I believe he WILL install a draft. I believe they have some nasty plans in the middle east to kill off all our young strong men and will leave America crippled with no defense. I believe he will help make this happen, even though right now he is covering that up. When he was sworn into office he refused to use the bible, but wanted to use the Karan, then Muslim ""bible"". The ""Church"" he belongs too gave an award to Louis Farrakhan, saying Farrakhan ""truly epitomized greatness""....ok if you know anything about Louis Farrakhan you will know he is anything BUT great. Obama also when to a Wahabbi School, the school that trained and tought the same Muslim groups that are claiming Jihad on America. Wake up ya'll.....this man is BAD NEWS. It will be the first small step in taking down America. I know this will tickle some of you, cause I knwo we have a lot of Anti-American's here (even one's that are American) but guess what, the down of our nation will INCLUDE you and your family. You life as you know it will be over.....

I am Anti-Obama and I will tell it to anyone that will listen.

Please....feel free to vent your feelings here. i would honestly LOVE to hear why you support him....and I was to see just how well he is fooling young American. This man is evil....""


After some back and forth, she replies:

""I think he has been bread for this.

I think he is a Muslim, and while I know not all Muslims are the enemy, I believe some of them are. I know he is a ""Chirstian"" and I also believe that is a cover up. While I might not be 100% right.....I got a BAD BAD feeling about him. Normally I don't get into politics but something isn't sitting right with me on this one.

I wish I knew someone that was knowledgeable on politics that I could ask question too. I have spent so long ""not caring"" that I don't know enough. I do know that Obama is hiding something and McCain is NOT the answer....and I am not even a very big Clinton supporter but she is the best choice (from what I do know).......

There is just so much crap out there, I don't think anyone knows the ""truth"". I do know I am not the one only one that gets the willies from Obama, but the people that see through that seems to know a lot more then me and i don't talk about it cause I don't know enough to keep up. The peopel I know, that are pretty clueless like me, support Obama cause he is the ""cool"" choice. The next JFK is what he is being called......but I think that is by people that have not done enough research. I think his good feeling is spoon fed and I am not buying it. ""

The problem is that given the US's electoral system it's likely that the choice in future elections will continue to be between the Democrats and the Republicans. I hope this doesn't happen, but if the Obama presidency becomes unpopular for any reason it's likely that the Republicans would have a good chance of winning an election regardless of who's in charge.

What's funny is he solidly argued against McCain saying the Iraq war didn't have anything to do with terrorism, but how much did Afghanistan have to do with it?  That still escapes me seeing as the majority of terrorists were Saudis.  I don't know, maybe I'm the idiot here, but I'm starting to doubt reddit a little more over this issue.

It's normal to vote for someone who you believe has faced similar life experiences as you. Race is only important to minority voters because it has caused people of minorities to experience racism. Voting for Obama, to them, is voting for someone who probably also experienced racism and would be most likely to enact policies to eradicate it. I'm not sure I'd call that racism. 

Or maybe, just *maybe*, they voting for him because he's the obvious best candidate and roughly 50% of the white voters are *avoiding* him because he's black.

"I still believe it’s a factor. You have to walk the walk when it comes down to it. What I didn’t realize though, is that its less than half of what makes people successful. Meaning if your talent is flawless, you’ve gone about 40% of the way… you still get an F.  

I’ve always known this, but I’ve never really understood this until the last few years. 
The other 60% are people skills. Most people have no idea what a different world you live in when people like you. As obvious as that sounds it really hard for most to grasp on the level of being a successful person; but its why crappy bands get signed while talented ones continue to play for free drinks at the bar. 

When I say making people “like you.” I don’t mean lack of disgust or indifference or ""we have something in common"". I mean giving people an impression in an Obama or Steve Jobs kind of way. When people who just met you walk away smiling, that is what gets you in the door. When people like you they’ll make exceptions for you, introduce you to people they know, go out of their way to help you. They’ll put their careers on the line (aka sign that aforementioned band) because they believe in you.  It has little to do with talent. 

Edit: I never really answered your question, just ranted. The ""why"" part was seeing time after time people who were not as smart or experienced get further in their fields than people who were. The realization finally sunk in when I started paying attention to this attribute. Suddenly even though my talent was the same, my success had gone up.",17

I'm always arguing with people about Obama and having them say shit like, 'You're drinking the Kool-Aid, Obama can do no wrong to you, if something came out negative about him you wouldn't believe it...'

I figure if there is anything, it would have to have come out by now, right?

I like the idea a couple redditors have had to use the Obama /r/ after the election to sort of 'keep tabs' on Obama, and frankly I think Obama himself would like the idea.

"**PART 2**

I would like to propose two elections this fall:  One would be a beauty contest and the other would be for the Presidency of the United States.  There would only be one rule: the same person could not win both!  Quite a bit has been written about the following subjects, although very little by the mainstream media MSM, who I believe is “in the Tank” for Obama.  Example:  Chris Matthews, of MSNBC, get tingles up his leg when listening to Obama!  If you don’t think there is bias, look at the army of investigators that is bolstering the Alaskan economy as it looks for dirt on Sarah Palin.  Look at the intense scrutiny of “Joe the Plumber”, who has been thoroughly investigated after his recent encounter with Obama.  He asked Obama about raising taxes on the rich, and has since become the “poster boy” for opposition to Obama’s “spreading the wealth” plan.  We may know more about Joe that Obama – even though he is not running for office.  We can’t get access to Obama’s college and university records, his birth certificate (that has been found suspect by some) or his State Bar credentials.  If “past is prologue”, as Joe Biden claims, I want to know a lot more about Obama’s past.  What I can see scares the dickens out of me.  Do you know that he probably couldn’t get a Top Security Clearance, for a military career, due to his admitted drug use and past associations?  And yet, he will have access to the most sensitive details of our national security as president.  When he takes his oath to “uphold the Constitution of the United States”, will it be the Constitution our Founders left us, or the one that can be interpreted to support his particular worldview – that would be the “Living Constitution”?  Does it matter?  I believe it does.  So I have tried to understand why anyone would or should vote for Obama???  Here goes!  Reasons to vote for Obama – or not:

   1. Because of his extensive executive experience?    (The President is the Chief Executive Officer of our country)  Oops!  He has none.
   2. Because his political worldview is consistent with America’s constitution and traditions?  Oops!  The cornerstone of his agenda is very socialistic (as opposed to capitalistic) and will foster class warfare.  That is, the growing class that consumes tax benefits will seek to gain ever more from the shrinking class that produces wealth. The latter will resent this theft, but will become increasingly unable to protect what they earn from predatory taxation.  Joe Biden said they (The Obama-Biden Administration) would take from the rich and give to the poor, and that it was patriotic for the rich to go along with that.  Obama told “Joe the plumber” that everyone is better off when we “spread the wealth around”.  Taxing the rich class to enrich the poor class provides strong disincentives for both, but it may win a lot of votes.  Someone once said that no country can long survive when its constituents learn they can vote themselves largess from the government coffers.  It is worth noting two things:  1) Rich people invest and takes risks to provide jobs and fuel our economy, and 2) the government does not make money – it only redistributes what it takes from its citizens.  Who do you know that ever got a good job from poor folks?  Yes, our country has long had a progressive tax system, but it was previously designed to pay the Nation’s bills.  The new design is aimed at the redistribution of wealth. 
   3. Because he is thrifty with our money?  He has missed a lot of work, but not his paycheck, as he applies for his next job.  He has spent almost $1,000,000 per day in earmarks during his tenure as a U.S.Senator.  When defending his spending in a recent debate, he said earmarks only accounted for $18,000,000,000.
   4. Because he has been thoroughly vetted?  Not a chance, considering the mainstream media (MSM).  The media’s love affair and liberal bias has resulted in the death of journalism.  Many months of campaigning should have exposed every pertinent detail of Obama’s past, but we have just recently started to learn some important things:
         1. Bill Ayers, unrepentant terrorist and founder of the Weather Underground is not “just a guy in Obama’s neighborhood”.   He is not someone who has kids in the same school – there is a wide age difference in their kid’s ages.  Bill Ayers and Obama worked together when Ayers gave him his first job in Chicago politics, (lasting 7 years) to administer $50,000,000 (and much more later) for the Chicago Annenberg Challenge.  It was ostensibly for improving education, but didn’t improve math, reading or English.  In fact the money didn’t even go to the schools.  Instead, the money was spent to politically radicalize students through non-school organizations such as ACORN!  They later worked together again, for three years, on the Woods Foundation.  Bill Ayers and his wife Bernadine Dohrn, also a domestic terrorist, hosted Obama’s first political “coming out party” in their home, in 1995.  After 9/11 Ayers, who readily admitted to domestic bombings but was released on prosecutorial misconduct, stated that he was not sorry for the bombings – he felt they didn’t do enough.  Ayers is a hero and advisor to Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan President.  Question:  What do Osama Bin Laden and Barack Obama have in common?  They both have friends who have bombed the Pentagon!
         2. Chicago politics?  Why did Obama choose to lay the foundation for his political career in Chicago, long noted for political corruption?  ‘Nuff said.
         3. Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) is a non-profit organization with a history of fraudulently registering thousands of voters.  They receive 40% of their financial support from the Federal Government, and much more from George Soros.  Acorn is currently under investigation in a dozen states for thousands of fraudulent voter registrations.  In Nevada they were caught because they tried to register the Dallas Cowboy’s roster – someone apparently noticed Tony Romo’s name and got suspicious.  An Ohio man admitted to registering 72 times.  Mickey Mouse even got registered, but McCain thinks the “Big Rat” may vote for him!  It seems that if you are going to get paid for registering voters, you need to meet your quota in order to get your pay check.  ACORN also used intimidation and coercive tactics to get banks to make risky home mortgages, to unqualified buyers, contributing significantly to the current economic crisis.  Obama trained ACORN, directed money to ACORN and represented ACORN as an attorney.  His campaign recently gave $830,000 to ACORN.  He also promised ACORN a “place at the table” when he is President.  The first $700,000,000 bailout plan (the one that was voted down) included $100,000,000 earmarked for ACORN.

 

            NOTE:  I think I finally understand what a “community organizer” does.  He spreads money around and trains the poor to get what they want through intimidation, coercion and political machinations.  Can you see how this might secure a dependable voting bloc?  Wouldn’t it be far better to equip people with the knowledge and skills to become productive, to take responsibility for themselves, to work hard in school and on the job, to eschew drugs, to build strong intact families, etc?  (I am all for helping the needy, but struggle a lot with helping the greedy!) ",1
"&gt;Little kids are notorious for parroting what their parents say and believe.

That is so true. I try not to say my own personal political views very much when talking to my younger children, because I'd like it if they grew up to think for themselves. However, the other day my son came home from school all excited because they had a mock election to see if Obama or McCain would win. My son (11-years old) was so excited to tell me that Obama won. Even though I've basically kept my mouth shut through this whole election process, it was hard for me to contain myself the last day or two. Anyway, later that night as the results were coming in, I walk through the room he was in and he was GLUED to CNN---wouldn't move at all. Of course he doesn't understand the electoral process, and that just because numbers say one thing at one point, it can all change. So anytime he saw a state turning red he would yell out ""WHO ARE THESE MORONS?!?!?!?!?"". I've never once said something like that in front of him about republicans, but clearly he picked up on my feelings. ",32

I realize some people would argue the merits part--obviously he was severely lacking in experience--but to clarify what I mean, think about how it would appear if Palin became the first female US president, as compared with Hillary being the first to reach that spot.  I despise Hillary, but there's no doubt that she's more than smart enough and politically capable enough to merit being a US president (same for Obama).

What political views are correct? With a democratic government it is by most standards larger, and with a larger government you loose more individual freedoms. With a smaller government there is more room for the private sector and therefore more room for an individual to grow. But at the same time there is a lot more wiggle room for monopolies, and a lot more room to get fucked over by cheap production and lead based paint.

My dad is poor, very poor, he has cavities going deep into his jaw and teeth exploding on him once every year. It is the saddest thing I have ever seen in my life, and eventually his cavities will work their way into his brain and you know what happens then. I am one year too young to vote, but I would have voted for Obama just to see him get some medical. Infact my government is so fucked up that he is not allowed to get a job because of asshole courts unwilling to admit they are wrong.

I am sorry but I am having a hard time getting my thoughts on to paper, let me try and put it another way. As far as politics go my balls are on the fence, on one hand you have a large government that has healthier citizens at the expense of their wealth. On the other you have the most free people the world has ever seen at the expense of some basic rights (health for example) I just don't know what is right and what is wrong at this point. This is hard for me to explain, please keep reading.

Here look at it this way, some people are very afraid of Obama and think his single goal is the pain and suffering of America. But I mean come on! No one grows up wishing they could be a mass murderer, Bush has good intentions but he is just a moron. Did Mao want to murder 70 million people? Stalin was controlling because he was afraid of his citizens being free. So wouldn't a perfectly libertarian government eventually devolve into the bush administration? No one actually thinks they are evill, people get way out of proportion sometimes. Why would the government fabricate 9/11? To go to Iraq? Why? For oil? Why? For a new world order? WHY? Someone tell me why would someones goal be the pain, suffering.

No one wants my dad to die of a simple fucking cavity, he can't eat some days the pain is so bad. Why someone tell me why does things have to be the way it is? Why do well intentioned people cause so much pain and suffering. My vision is obstructed and I can no longer continue typing. I am sorry for this long rant and I hope someone has read it.

I wish I knew of a reasonable, quantifiable measure of the average American's well-being and general outlook on life. GDP/capita comes to mind but is too narrow. Some sort of standard of living measure might suffice provided it doesn't skew results too heavily in favor of Euro-Nanny-States, as is often the case with these types of measures, thus leading to a pro-Obama inclination. 

Upon further research, the [Human Development Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) might be the most objective of such indices, at least that I can find.

I like Obama's style very much - I think he definitely brings a fresh wind into politics, and if he wins at least I won't be cringing from embarrassment every time I see our president on TV.

Ron Paul was one of the only candidates that I really believed would actually try his hardest to change the status quo. I also agree with him virtually 100% on foreign policy and the economy. 

There are a few of his pet issues that he takes much more seriously than I do, but on the issues that the president has (or should have) the most control over (i.e., foreign policy), he's spot-on.",12

He's probably convinced that Iran wants to blow up the world -- they might, granted, but I don't see the evidence for it, just rhetoric without the resources to back it up. You might want to ask him where he gets his information, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's tuned into some pretty right-wing media.

1.  Optional universal health care.  Approximately 40 million Americans are without it.  McCain's plan makes health care more expensive and is beneficial largely for insurance companies.  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/opinion/16herbert.html?em
2.  Obama's tax/economic plan.  obamataxcut.com  It aims to be an equalizer and to give a boost to the poor and the middle class.  See here for details.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/22/AR2008012202614.html?hpid=opinionsbox1
3.  The environment.  Obama is favored/endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters.  Also, Obama's vs. McCain's records on alternative energy speak volumes.  McCain has voted against it consistently.  Now, his campaign is suddenly giving altenergy lip service.
4.  Women's rights.  If your dad is not pro-choice, stay away from this one.  If he is, consider how many years women would be set back by overturning Roe v. Wade with the appointment of more Scalia's.
5.  Obama's ability to surround himself with good advisers.  He prefers an academic prof to a lobbyist.  You kinda just have to know examples on this one.  Rick Davis, the McCain campaign manager, on the other hand, received $15k from Freddie Mac last month.
6.  Net neutrality.  McCain thinks of the internets as a market to be given free competition.  If you have windsurfed the internets, you know this is a different medium.  
7.  Running a campaign is an executive job.  Obama is organized and has inspired tons of people grass roots up.  Cite the # of volunteers for each side.  He was smart to think beyond New Hampshire in the primaries (another tribute to adviser/manager David Axelrod).  Small donor contributions in this campaign have mattered more than ever.  McCain seems impotent next to Obama, with people just now getting excited over Palin.
8.  Foreign policy (yes.).  Obama doesn't confuse the Sunni and the Shia.  Obama's veep choice is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  You could argue that the surge is working, but you could also say, yeah, but at what cost?  What is victory when your men still die continually?  Iraq was a mistake, period.
9.  Obama's experience is EXACTLY what Lincoln's experience was: Illinois state senate, then U.S. senate.
10.  International relations look good with Obama, who sparks inspiration worldwide.  Take a look at the crowds he gathered abroad.  There is anecdotal evidence of his respect, as well.  Mostly, people want to see how far we've come since we've had to fight for civil rights in the 60s.

i am not voting for obama.,1
"I was talking to a loved one a few days ago and I brought up the Obama FISA vote.  Eventually the conversation moved towards more general election stuff and she said, ""I like Obama, but I think he's too young.""  While I suppose that's a valid concern, I replied, ""well, sure, but you should look at his stances on issues and see if they make sense, above anything else.""  She said she wanted to do that, but the mainstream media doesn't really offer much in the way of, eh, actual information, so she doesn't know where to look.  I know of a few resources like this, http://www.ontheissues.org being the best one I've seen, but I want to know what else is out there.  So basically, I'm looking for:
* Good, unbiased information about each candidate and his positions, including 3rd party candidates
* Intelligent summaries of the arguments for and against each issue, if possible
* A general overview of what third party candidates there are, and the arguments for/against voting third party (especially the issue of ""wasting a vote"")
Also, if there's any sort of ""here's all the big things the Bush administration has done in the last eight years, decide for yourself if they're good or bad"" list available, that'd be nice too.  I've seen a few ""civil rights timelines since 9/11"" floating around, but I'd like to maintain *some* kind of objectivity, despite my feelings on the topic (impeach the fucker!).  She, being that she mostly relies on the MSM, doesn't really know about a lot of the stuff the Bush administration has done (other than wiretapping) -- she didn't know, for example, about all the Gitmo detainees being held without charge -- so I'd like to get some information on that, but at the same time I don't want to give her a barrage of anti-Bush stuff if she actually feels that way about those issues.  
I'm not really trying to change her views on anything; I'm just trying to give her more information so she can see how her views match up with those of the candidates, and maybe get some more information about those issues she hasn't made up her mind about.

"&gt;The first comment accuses everybody of misogyny but I expect nobody to think: ""Ah, now I know how girls download videos. I always wondered why their videos have such a low quality"".

Why do you expect no one to think this? This is an assumption. Like putting a picture up of Obama eating a watermelon and some fried chicken. You're asserting, in the same situation, that no one would think of Obama as a racial stereotype. There are people who do. Irony is fine in small doses, but there are actually people who believe this. It's silly to assume that there is NO misogyny on Reddit, and that it's always just a joke.

I am aware that the secondary comment was meant to pacify, but it does just the opposite by furthering commentary. The post should have been downmodded into the ground at the get go. Instead, voting it up, even with 'irony', supports the misogyny already in place.

You are right, however, in that I should have been more specific in my second comment. I should have said, ""No one with half a brain would think your comment is funny.""

&gt;According to my world view, jokes always are about a group [...]

I think this view is flawed. What do you think Tina Fey's Sarah Palin impression is? It's certainly not about Alaskans, Hockey Moms, or Mavericks - it's about one woman, and that's why it's funny.

&gt;Being an emo tramp is no choice either

Are you kidding me? I can't tell anymore. Myspace/emo are both choices in technology and fashion. No one is BORN with an interest in Myspace. That's ridiculous.

&gt;stand a joke hints at a lack of self-confidence and that somebody's identity is defined by that group. A joke about the group never effects an individual member of the group in the same way as the individual does not gain or loose value just because it is a member of that certain group.

I disagree. I see this place as sometimes hostile to women. I point this out constantly in hopes of creating a more welcoming environment. These 'Jokes' (most of them are not anything special, just misogyny and fear of women in written or cartoon form), are something that degrades my group, and makes me feel unwelcome here. It has nothing to do with self-confidence; I have a right to be here, and men shouldn't be allowed special privileges. If you see a racist comment, it gets downvoted. If you see an anti-semitic comment, it gets voted down. Why, then, is sexism ok?

&gt;but i can't call that joke misogynistic. What do you prefere?

The OP's title (not the picture), at its core, portrays women as inferior - in this case, technologically. This portrayal is demeaning to my gender, and therefore misogynist. I don't understand why you have a problem with this.

&gt;So, take it easy and get that respect for your person. Fighting for respect for a group does not give respect to you.

Here's your prejudice coming through - what about this conversation is excited or hysterical? It's plain text. There is no reason to tell me to 'take it easy'. That's an assumption on your part that I am emotionally engaged.

Obama != freedom,2
"Let's see if I can make a big all encompassing post.

I think Reddit is very knee jerk. It's not that I disagree with some ideas, I guess just the degree. I think in the MSM/real world, stuff like (as is listed below) attitudes towards police and marijuana and conspiracy theories are swung so far one way, that Reddit tries to compensate by swinging so far the other way.

Read the atheism subreddit. Many of them have become so dogmatic in their beliefs, that they resemble Christians or whoever. Read the men's right subreddit, their reaction to pro-women policies is so pro-man that they are doing the same thing as what they hate. 

I think reading the libertarian subreddit, people are too convinced of their self-righteousness and hold too much faith in a utopian ideal.

I think Obama fans are too petty, and are disconnected from the real world, to the point that Obama may lose but they do not fully grasp.

I think people on here actually think there are republicans lurking around, when this site is either left or left libertarian in it's outlook.

I think people here are partisan first, principle second, meaning I think they choose their principles and arguments on if it will benefit their side.

I think we are very self-righteous, because we assume that we are *right* because the internet is somehow pure in its information, or more pure than the MSM.

I think too many people believe in some over arching force over the media/politics, when many people are largely ignorant, and their media and politics is tailored to them. 

I think someday our point of view will become mainstream, and we will be happy, as another group of kids rail against what we think. 

I think Reddit resembles your average newspaper, in its mix of news, bias, entertainment, cartoons and the like.

There was no real 'debate',in the classic Aristotelian sense,where there are precise rules and logical principles of debate, rather than just show-boating of rhetoric.

Biden clearly had more understanding of the issues,and more willingness to actually address the questions (which is generally called honesty).

It would have been a much more interesting and substantive debate if it had Ron Paul as the moderator, asking the questions that needed to be discussed! Can you even imagine that?

All in all, the debate was won by the Bankers.

Just remember: in the Senate vote yesterday, Biden, Obama and McCain ALL voted for the huge cash gift to the bankers,robbing the American people and destroying the value of our dollar! 
We'll see if the house collapses tomorrow and also approves the huge robbery. (According to polls, 90% of the US citizens are AGAINST the big give-away to banks. So much for 'representative' government!

It is indeed 'taxation without representation!'

"No, actually. Or not to me, anyway. It seems like a set up for keeping people interested in an election where one candidate is obviously going to win. 

Reading the whole article, one notices the only poll they cite as having the race anything like close is the George Washington University Battleground Poll, while they say of their own poll:

""Among all 1,101 adults interviewed, the survey showed Obama ahead 47 percent to 37 percent. He was up by five points among registered voters.""

So basically the article posits one thing and then cites sources, including the very poll it's reporting about, that imply something entirely different. I'm sad about the death of reliable journalism, but democracy is still kicking.",3
Ask him if he would sign your new Obama t-shirt.,7
"Third parties have always been irrelevant and probably always will.  This is painful, brings the room down, but it is a fact.  Third parties have exactly one chance to affect anything - taking votes away from a mainstream candidate in a close race where it matters.  

The Libertarians are the most obvious example of a complete and total failure in this regard.  And I sympathize with Greens and Libertarians and people who want a radical change in how things are done.   Third parties might attract a following if they win elections.  To win elections, they need a following.

And this is why they're marginal.

Second, anyone really naive enough to think that any electable Democrat, including Obama, is likely to be some kind of savior of all mankind, really needs to come to grips with the very basic fact that people get elected by telling people what they want to hear.  If you can earn a percentage point by changing course or saying something that your constituents don't want to hear, but won't necessarily abandon you for saying, you're going to do it.

People don't want to be told the truth.  They want to hear things that assuage their fears (or their guilt) and confirm their own biases of how the world works.

The economic doom and gloom crowd on Reddit, who are somehow all economics experts (along with their counterparts), mod down those who say this is just a normal economic recession and will somehow work its way out, and the ""this is just a normal economic recession"" crowd mods down the apocalypse crowd.  Everyone in the world is *so sure* of their take on reality, so convinced that *they alone* have a monopoly on the understanding of the ""real world"" that electing someone who confirms this fairly remarkable (if widespread) bias is an imperative.

Third, electoral seasons in the United States are pure theater.  Trying to conclude anything by what candidates say and do during campaign season is like trying to ascertain a product's quality by watching the commercial.  It is amusing to hear people get all starry eyed and then feel HORRIBLY BETRAYED by something a candidate says or does during election season.  They're politicians - that's what they do.  Take a fucking alka-seltzer.

The United States will have mediocrity for leadership because this is, ultimately, what people demand.  Anyone who is sharply principled is probably unelectable, as, by and large, the majority of Americans would rather a corrupt liar who tells them what they want to hear, than a principled, honest person who doesn't confirm their own fantasies about how reality works.  No American believes this to be true of themselves of course, which is why it's *funny*.  ""Everyone's a FUCKING MORON...except for me.""

The best single reason to vote for Barack Obama in the upcoming election is the punish the Republicans.  But I certainly don't believe a goddamn word he says, because I have no yardstick by which to measure his credibility yet.  This is a man who honestly feels in his heart he is the best of 300 million+ people to run the country.  Can you imagine feeling that way?  I can't.  We ought to look at politicians the way we look at L Ron Hubbard or Jim Jones, but instead we all want to believe our chosen candidates are fucking King Arthur.

The whole problem here is that those who would seek political power are probably the last people, in a perfect world, who should ever hold it.

Until we start drafting the reluctant from normal walks of life to be political leaders, this will always be so.  These would be people who owe no favors to anyone and are humble enough to admit that they cannot possibly understand the mind-boggling complexities of today's political, social, and economic problems, and so surround themselves with the brightest and most studied experts, rather than, oh, horse enthusiasts (see Michael D. Brown, ex-director of FEMA).

We cannot change the world until we change people, and their relation to the political process, and to their own ideologies.  All of us walk only in our own shoes, and our political biases are far commonly less a result of being smarter than the other guy, and more often based on our own experiences, and the understanding of the world which has best allowed us to function.  It's not that everyone's ""so stupid,"" of course.  It's that they don't *agree with our own biases* that we translate into that.

This took me many years to understand.  It's unpleasantly humbling.  At this point all I know is my own morals - what is of value to me.  Increasingly, translating this into a political program is next than impossible.  I really don't know.

I don't think anyone else does either.",0
"I'm German, so while it won't have a profound effect on me who gets to be the next US president, I can't vote in these elections. 

I am also quite conflicted about Obama. Part of me would really like to support and endorse him, but OTOH I have a big problem with his stance on US imperialism by military force -- which he is happy to reap and keep the economic rewards of. Obama is no Kucinich and no Paul; he is not really a candidate of peace and principles when it comes to renouncing and giving back the ill gotten gains of US wars, and paying reparations, and really bringing all US troops home unconditionally.

And then there's FISA, where I also haven't forgotten Obama's stance. 

I agree that Obama is definitely the lesser of two ""evils"", but that would still make it difficult for me to support him. If I could vote in US elections, I eventually still *might*, given the circumstances,  vote for Obama rather than an independent or ""third party"" candidate I really could support, but in doing so I would be very aware that I would be compromising my principles and it thus would feel dirty. The fact that Kucinich has thrown his weight behind Obama makes it easier, but it would still feel dirty.

I do however realize that in the US media and electoral and corporate landscape, a candidate not keeping the loot from US military campaigns and not caving on FISA would probably be branded ""unelectable"" and not stand a chance. But that's a self-fulfilling prophecy and doesn't really justify voting for Obama.

That said, part of me really really likes the guy and thinks he's awesome and would love to support and vote for him. 

As I said, I'm quite conflicted.

"   While I also agree with pompitous, I cannot stress enough my fourth paragraph.  I find that living in Nebraska and knowing that casting my early vote with the knowledge that the best I can expect is that I am voicing my regret of my isolation from a thinking environment causes me to live more agitated than I might be if I lived elsewhere.  I wish that I at least lived in the Omaha area, so I could at least believe that my vote might help with getting Obama the one electoral collage vote that may be viable there. That at least would allow me to believe that voting made some difference.  

But reality here is that if you are not supporting a republican candidate, casting your ballot is often largely an exercise in futility (I would love to be surprised by the results here, but have no hope that will happen),   The republican's are due some credit for the intelligence of their campaign at least in this state, in that while they proclaim the values of morality, freedom, etcetra, they also manage to keep the voting folk downtrodden enough to make sure that they really do not have time for more than a gut reaction to the platforms provided.

First to answer a few questions.  I got laid off as a result of the economy.  I work(ed) in real estate, and the money dried up.  We are discussing moving forward as an hourly consultant, but if things don't turn around inside of 6 months to a year, they are toast.  So, not sure how long I could make that last.  

The best reads, by far, are the ideas of nuking things, leaving nasty cron jobs, trojans, posting the admin password on Chinese websites (damn that is just cold), crank phone calls to the boss, asking for myself, then getting mad at them when I am not there.  There was on about changing the admin/root password by one character every few days.  I bookmarked that one.  Love it.  I won't do that at work, but I do know some people that are going to see that one.

Realistically though, I am using Linked In to reach out to everyone and establish contacts, update the resume and get that out ASAP, call vendors and people that I have worked with and get the word out that I am out to anyone and everyone.  I would love to indulge myself with some time off, but I have a family and can't afford the time.  The last time I got laid off (well fired back then) was the summer of 2001.  I took the summer off.  It was good.

"As far as I have gathered, Obama doesn't want to end ""it"" without casualties. AFAIK, he wants to end the current large-scale US deployment to Iraq *without further **US** casualties*. If he has promised to do this without Iraqi casualties, then I'd love to hear where and when he said or wrote that. Anyway, since you're asking, here's what more I want:

1. An *unconditional* and **full** withdrawal of all US forces and mercenaries from Iraq and Afghanistan in the shortest possible timeframe.

2. A public acknowledgment of the fact that these invasions were illegal from start (no proper prior declaration of war, no proper UN mandate, etc, etc.) to finish (not that it's finished yet...), and a public apology, and an the opening of public UN-mediated negotiations for reparations.

3. Along with said reparations, the US should bankroll the cost of UN peacekeeping force deployments if and as long as such are requested by the democratic majority of the Iraqi and Afghani people. At the same time, US troops and mercenaries should be barred from contributing any troops to such peacekeeping missions and should be excluded from their chains of command. They should however be ready to share whatever know-how or intelligence they may have to ease the transition. Referenda should be held on these matters.

4. Total and unconditional annulment of all deals involving US-affiliated companies and multinationals that involve Iraqi and Afghani natural resources and land and that were concluded post invasion. Affirmation of the ownership of Iraqi and Afghani natural resources by their people, and the initiation of new, free negotiations over possible future commercial deals regarding Iraqi and Afghani natural resources and/or pipelines, etc. if such are desired by the democratic majority of the people of these respective countries. Referenda should be held on these matters.

5. The immediate cessation of US military threats to all countries in the region, and the opening of full diplomatic relations with all local regimes. To this end, it might help to re-recruit all these scores of US ex-diplomats who resigned in droves during the Bush administration, for obvious reasons.

Also, I'd like a pony.

"Under Obama's plan, you are not ""giving to the poor"" as much as you are taking less of a percentage of wages for taxes from the poor and taking a higher percentage from the rich.  Do you think the current tax system is socialism?  Because as it stands, this is already in effect, it's just that Obama wants to widen the gap a bit more.  And if someone wants to be technical about capitalism vs. socialism, then think of it this way.... If we were truly practicing capitalism, then when a road needed to be build, the govenment would say "" well, you be get to saving"" - THAT'S CAPITALISM.  When a town needed a new Water Treatment Facility, the goverment would say that it should be built and paid for by private companies, and that no loans or grants will help pay for it- THAT'S CAPITALISM.  And when a bank fails, there is no FDIC to make sure that you don't lose everything- THAT'S CAPITALISM.  So, if you want to think that capitalism is so great, think of those things.

It doesn't mean that the Patriot Act is good, or that it was a good thing Biden wrote it.

I fear that his presidency will make the scum 'rise to the surface', and will cause some initial racial tension.  I see this as a step forward, after a step back.  The step back being that this will give a voice to all of the deep seeded racism that still exists, but we will be able to step forward after that racism is proven to be ineffective. 

I was actually talking to my husband about this last night, after receive on of those 'viral emails' at work that make my stomach turn.  Please note that the email was sent to everyone who works at my job that is white, and not sent to the 20 plus people who work there that are black.  The email was the basic bullshit, but what I found interesting, and disturbing, was statements such as this...
"" Obama then went on to finish his degree at Columbia, but how did he pay for it? Student loans? Maybe?"".... "" Obama studied law at Harvard, but where did he get the money to pay for this high end education? Another student loan? Unlikely!""

Why WHY is it questionable that he got student loans to go to college and law school?  Why is it so amazing that a black man got a high end education by getting student loans?  I mean, nobody can question that he is intelligent, bright, charismatic, and driven... so why is his ability to goto college with student loans questionable?  Nobody has EVER questioned a white man about how he paid for college.  Bill Clintons family was WAY poorer than Obama's, but nobody ever questioned how he paid for school.  I think it comes down to some deep seeded racism, that while not along the same lines as calling someone the N word, relates to some notion that African Americans are either lazy, unmotivated, poor, have bad credit, or all of thee above... I've even heard people say that he couldn't have paid for college because he didn't play a sport!!!!

There is still a deep racial divide in this country, and I am hopeful that Obama's presidency will prove that not only can a black man be the leader of the free world, but that he is the best leader of the free world.

On a more global scale, compared to other western democracies, the United States doesn't really have a left wing at all - Obama is just much less right wing than all the others.  But he could never have been elected without routinely and publicly proclaiming his religious faith, for example, which just doesn't happen in Canada or Europe, it's a non-issue.  Positions on health-care funding in the U.S, too, can largely be understood in terms of how much they plan to continue to avoid state involvement in a way that has been the norm in the rest of the developed world for decades.",7
"Ron Paul has integrity, and he got my primary vote.  Relative to the other candidates, Obama has integrity, plus the charisma and (apparently, *hopefully*) conscience we need in a leader.  Being more a civil libertarian than a hardcore capital-L, my disagreements with many of his positions aren't deal-breakers.

Ron Paul wouldn't have made a good president.  Practically, none but the worst of his positions (relating to religion, abortion, etc.) have a chance in Congress.  We'd be left with four years of gridlock and the entire populace soured on libertarians for the foreseeable future.

More importantly for the nation, he lacks the required force of personality.  Charisma isn't everything, but it's a damned big something.  A leader must be able to inspire people within and without, and effectively work with his fellow leaders.

Obama as a black president *might* help race relations.  Maybe not, and maybe it'll do the opposite.  In any case, his first speech (*in his own words*) after the Rev. Wright incident was refreshing, impressive, reasoned, and intelligent.

Obama as a *different* president should indeed help heal our relationship with the rest of the world.  Lunatics such as Ahmadinejad thrive because Bush *is* a warmongering bastard.  Radical anti-American bile is going to be a lot harder to swallow with a man like Obama as president.

Most of all, Obama *feels* to me like a sincere guy.  Maybe I'm a sucker, and maybe he's just like the rest of the scum in Washington.  I'm willing to take that chance.  He's the best we're being offered, he's *not* just ""a lesser of two evils"" for once, and I'm going to feel *good* having voted for him in November.

"What's happening here is:

(a) Political tribes take care of their own.  The fight between Obama and Clinton, and the associated theater of that fight, is over.

(b) The whole Obama mystique is that he's a gentleman.  This fuels that public image.  ""How sporting of him to step up and try to help his opponent.""

(c) His campaign people will probably find ways to use the Clintons in the campaign where she was stronger, such as with blue collar workers in some states.  So it's a little quid pro quo and back-scratching.

(d) Political constituencies think they are part of the process and that they matter more than the herded cows they actually are, so this appeal to them to help Hillary out makes  campaign donors feel like they're part of the Party (passing the plate around).  If that sounds a little perverse, it is.

Incidentally, I am supporting Obama in this campaign so none of the above should be taken as a slag on him - this is simply the reality of US politics, which is 100% theater, and theater is what Americans want.  

There is a famous anecdote about a 1960 Nixon-Kennedy debate.  Those listening on the radio felt that Nixon had won.  Those watching on television thought Kennedy had one.  On TV, Nixon looked a little haggard from the campaign trail, with a half day's beard growth and a rumpled suit.  In other words, Kennedy won on television because he looked better.

Likewise, this is why you have Clinton supporters who claim to hate Obama and will vote for McCain (even though Obama is maybe 15% different than Clinton ideologically while McCain is more like 75%), or people who make sweeping hateful statements about one candidate but get their little hearts aflutter about the other.

It is 100% theater and stage acting, and has been for generations now.  Contrary to what they say, this is what people want.  People want to feel like they can have a beer and shoot the shit with their candidate.  They want to believe they're ""one of us.""

They're not of course - they're the ruling class.  And they will pat us on the head and say ""how cute"" while taking our money and thanking us oh-so-sincerely.

There is no realistic alternative at present.  I actually switched my party affiliation to vote for Ron Paul in the primaries.  I didn't seriously expect him to win or even make a strong showing, but I hoped that enough numbers voting for him would maybe cause a little electoral fear in the Republicans.  Whether it did will remain to be seen when the vote is tallied in November, because I have a hard time believing most Ron Paul fans will have the intenstinal fortitude to vote for an authoritarian like McCain.

Of the two candidates, I hope Obama wins.  I am voting for him because I think he is competent - because he will be smart enough to surround himself by academics and intellectuals, because he'll want to know more than the big picture.  I don't think he's a saint or walks on water.  He may be a son of a bitch for all I know but at this point even basic baseline competence would be a step forward for the presidency.",94

Side note: is it possible that the GOP have run with McCain and Palin so as to lose the election? That way when Obama gets elected, and the economy is fucked, he is in the hot seat when it crashes and burns. Therefore giving the GOP an excuse to say look what the Democrats did to the economy? Of course this is based on the idea that the collapse of the US economy does not result in all out failure of the state.",1

Not just for the stricken american economy, but for worldwide energy and climate questions. Not to talk about unnecessary wars for oil (under the guise of crusades).

My dad is a ""Christian with a brain"" as he likes to say--meaning that he's relatively open-minded to other views, but still maintains the typical Christian political views. This is what the email looks like, so far:

Hey Dad,
You mentioned wanting to see some of Obama's earlier speeches. I also thought that I'd include some of his background, history, stances--anything that you might be able to take as actual information.


I'm not going to try to persuade you to vote one way by attacking the other. I think I've got to be better than that. I couldn't ever see myself sending out those hate-filled and slanderous emails. Instead, I thought I'd just show you a few persuasive, non-campaign videos so that you can get a pretty objective, unbiased approach instead of the crazy media-hyped views that incite the crazy Anti-Obama, OHMIGOD HE'S AN ELITIST! HE'S A SOCIALIST! HE'S A MUSLIM TERRIST! emails that get sent to all of us.


Let's start this off with how I came to be introduced to Obama. This is his ""Audacity of Hope"" speech that launched him into the limelight--it is possibly his most famous. I'd just say ignore the John Kerry endorsement, because it doesn't matter anymore.

Part 1:

Part 2:

Now, I realize that this is long speech, but it is well worth hearing if only for his closing moments:

""There is not a Liberal America and a Conservative America, There is the United States of America...The pundits like to slice and dice our country into Red States and Blue States, Red States for Republicans and Blue States for the Democrats, but I've got news for them too, we worship an awesome god in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the Red States.""",5
"Here's the Texas case. I'm a Texan, but I feel I'm in the minority here. I grew up in a rather small town so there hasn't bit a large bit of diveristy in my upbringing. I'll do the best I can to explain the (at least what I think is) general sentiment of Texans.


Most folks from Texas that I've run into who support McCain think Obama is full of hot air and don't like him because he's black (which really saddens me). I think I've steered most of my friends away from thinking he is a muslim but I can't really tell if they are joking or not when they talk about him being a muslim. I've spent about an hour or two writing a response to the obama is a muslim emails that has quotes from his books. People blindly believe it and it only fuels their fears that he is a muslim &amp; hates white people


From what I've seen, if they're voting for McCain, it's becuase they're Republican and it's the thing to do in Texas. God forbid you deviate from having a truck, hunting, having an arsenal of weapons, and voting Republican. It really is a way of life down here. Granted it isnt like that for everyone, it's what the majority of people do that I've seen. (Again, keep in mind I grew up in a small town) I'm about different in every way: no guns, I drive a foreign car, never hunted and have gone to see Obama in person and even shake his hand. There is also a strong religious element here. I went to a retreat with a few of my friends and I have never felt more indoctrinated than after I came out of that event. The religous issue comes into play with most people not having heard any rumors about McCains religion, while most people have heard that Obama is a muslim.


As for the college scene (Aggie being the name of the students at Texas A&amp;M, hence my name). Well, Texas A&amp;M was voted the most conservative campus. So as you guessed, it's mostly republican here just becuase little Timmy and Susie haven't learned to think on their own yet (or so I hope anyway). I've seen more shirts in favor of McCain down here, but I've also seen a few Obama shirts as well. I'm not saying that it's the conservatives down here switching to Obama, but rather illustrating that there is some elements within this state that are liberal (at least for texas anyway.)


I would think that our rival (University of Texas) is a bit of the opposite, they're probably the most liberal large university that I can think of in Texas (I dont know what they would rank in the nation though). I bring this up just to show that luckily not everyone here is a Bushie (though one of my friends is, who is otherwise pretty smart) or full blown republican though it seems the majority of everyone down here is.


If you want my opinion as a Texan, which I believe is pretty atypical for Texas - I'm all for Obama and can't stand what my country has turned into over the past 8 years. It frightens me that people still are going all out for McCain down here after everything Bush has done. Some think it's a positive that Bush and McCain are similar. They will blindly vote for McCain because he is a republican. I really don't like it here; should all things go correctly, I'll transfer to UT next year and eventually move out of this state to somewhere more accepting because I can't stand it here (Texas A&amp;M and just Texas).

------
As for the issue of if it's okay to ask people. Old people no, younger people I would think so. I try to restrain myself as my opinion is rather unpopular down here, but I don't think most younger people would mind, I wouldn't mind telling someone my opinions if they asked. Sorry for the long reply, I'm in class and really don't feel like listening to my prof butcher the english language anymore.",2

"To clarify further/add an example, each point equals one percent.  Thus, if the poll numbers are:

Obama: 53%
McCain: 47%

Obama would have a 6 point lead.",2
Dreams From My Father by Barack Obama.  But the movie is just soooooo long.,6
"Well, since the whole thing is apparently an elaborate hypothetical situation anyway, I'd say something like the following.

""Dad, if you were to disown me (for whatever it means to disown a grown man) for voting for Obama, who I'm not going to vote for because I'm voting for someone else, or at least I would be voting for someone else if I were planning to vote at all, I'd go crazy, kill you and the rest of the family, and then go on a national rampage of killing babies and putting them on spikes in the front yard.""

Feel free to paraphrase.",3
"**Nothing** in particular will happen when Obama is elected President in November (as I'm sure he will be), and that is the problem. The only Presidential candidate who *really* wants change is Ron Paul. Obama always takes about ""change"", but he isn't going to change anything, it's just going to be more of the same. In fact, it has occurred to me that the reason the Rockefeller's and the CFR are slotting a black man into the Presidential office for this next election is so that he can more effectively calm the rioting that will occur when the economic situation gets *really* bad and people start going hungry. Riots always start in poor neighborhoods first, and it is an unfortunate fact of life that in most cities people of African heritage and other minorities such as Hispanics are the primary occupants of the inner city ghettos.

P.S.  It has also occurred to me that one of the reasons our overlords want a black man in the white house during the next term, is because the USA is going to be hit by it's worst economic crisis in it's history during the next President's term, and there are a great many people who would like to be able to blame it on a black man. I think that is the real reason Obama was selected to be our next President.",-9
"The news team may or may not have been real. But other questions asked included ""Was Star Wars a true story?"" and ""Where is Australia on a map?"" I have been looking for this video for a while now, and just really want to see it because it is so hilarious and as a counterpoint to this stupid (yet hilarious) howobamagotelected.com video that conservatives are using to say Obama voters are stupid (which I contend, as a general rule, that people are stupid).",2
I interpret it as he is working towards a better country now and will give up the laudable sentiment if Obama loses by suspicious circumstances. ,1
"Should I be worried that the latest Zogby poll places McCain 5 points ahead of Obama? Or is that just a reflection of those who answer land line polling?

Is this just grandma and grandpa, now afraid of Obama thanks to McCain placing negative ads on the picture box, answering the phone around seven with half of them voting for McCain? If only about half of them are then that's actually some good news.

Of course I'm being absurd here, but what are other people's thoughts? Is this an issue for concern? Shouldn't Obama be leading far more by now than he is?",1
"I voted Nader.  It was tough to not vote Obama because Nebraska splits its electoral votes, and it's looking like Obama might have enough votes to pick District #2 off (Omaha).  An electoral vote split in Nebraska has never happened before.",1
