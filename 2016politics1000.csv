"Huh? The *same* IG, along with the State IG, confirmed months ago that two emails were TS/SCI classified *at the time*, and two CIA/NGA reviews since then have confirmed that.

Straight from the horse's mouth:

http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/210-press-releases-2015/1232-statement-from-the-inspectors-general-of-the-intelligence-community-and-the-department-of-state-regarding-the-review-of-former-secretary-clinton-s-emails

Quote: 

&gt; ""These emails were not retroactively classified by the State department; rather these emails contained classified information when they were generated . . . . This information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.""

Here's how this got so muddled: On the one hand, you have Republicans too focused on Benghazi bullshit, thereby tainting this VERY REAL scandal with right-wing noise. On the other hand, you have Democrats -- including 99% of Bernie supporters -- swallowing the spin of Hillary and David Brock, thereby believing that this is one big nothingburger because the emails were, according to the spin, retroactively classified (completely false -- see IG quote above) or not marked classified (completely irrelevant).  

So when you say ""Now that the IG . . . ,"" you ought to realize you've probably been a victim of the Hillary/Brock spin to some extent. I'm not trying to insult you here -- that spin has been very loud, and only those with an IC background or a strong interest in this scandal could be expected to see through it (most people, you included, no doubt have better things to do). This is probably the first time you've seen the actual IG press release I linked to above, am I right?

I don't see the intelligence community letting this slide (hence the two CIA/NGA reviews that didn't come back in her favor). This is no Lewinsky blowjob or real-estate deal or whatever. The intelligence community's ability to gain valuable HUMINT in the most dangerous regions of the world largely depends on trust in the integrity of the US intel system. Nobody is going to put his or her life on the line as a source for a system that acts in lenient or politically expedient ways toward instances of gross negligence. Their world is so far beyond the ephemeral world of Democratic/Republican politics it's not funny. Hillary is a mere slug in their world.",152

The thing that bothers me most about the email thing, is that she just doesn't seem to understand the issue. She was serving as a representative for the people. Her job, 'Secretary of State', belongs to the people. The emails, the communication, the historical artifacts (gifts, etc), the official letterhead, the office itself - all of that belongs to the people. No one in that position, in that office, has any right to say 'Nah, this is mine, I'll keep this at home, I don't want anyone to see this either....'

"I am very much a right-winger but I think that this is the correct way to deal with this issue. Why has nobody else seriously proposed this before?

It's sad and very harmful that people don't trust their local police department. Having an external federal body check up on casualties should help clear things up enormously. This is an extension on how democratic government usually works: different independent bodies check up on each other in order to prevent abuses.

I expect that in the vast majority of cases the investigation will exonerate the police, but perhaps suggestions could be made for how the issue could have been de-escalated instead. Investigations should be done automatically, not just when the case escalates into a media circus. Normally local crime shouldn't receive national attention.

The cost issue seems nonsense. There should be relatively few deadly incidents and the cost of investigating them again should be small. The potential increase of trust in police would make this worthwhile.

The investigating body doesn't have to be federal but that seem like the easiest way to put this into practice. The important thing is that they have no relationship with the officers they're investigating.",237

You have to be punished for breaking the law; community service, probation, a fine, a public reprimand from your boss (POTUS), anything.

Bernie keeps  touting how socialism (or democratic socialism) is doing wonders in Europe, especially the nordic countries.  This isn't resonating with people over 30.

Things that we take for granted today like free elementary education, free public high schools, public roadways, etc - were once deemed to be socialist and communist benefits. 

Instead of talking all about Norway and Sweden, Bernie should be mentioning all of the things that exist in America Society today because of people like him.

Until then, the general public will not hear Bernie's talk about socialism and take it as a good thing.  Most people will be indifferent about it.   He needs speak in more laymans terms.  Talk about what exists today thanks to democratic socialism.  Stop saying things like ""oligarchy"" which the majority of Americans don't know the meaning of.   Stop demeaning Rich people - and build them up as potential 'heroes' that could save our country but choose not to.

"My thoughts on the debate:

- Paul had a lot of airtime compared to his last appearance on the main stage and quite enthusiastic applause. He was composed and didn’t stumble over his words like Christie or Jeb. Great answers on foreign policy, the NSA and *especially* when it came to body cameras. He came across as very informed when criticising fines as revenue and the War on Drugs. Not sure if it’ll translate to a campaign boost but he’s definitely the winner of this debate. He started a bruising fight against Cruz and Rubio and they attacked each other hard while he took no damage in return. Hit the mark with highlighting the Clinton Foundation’s donations from women-hating countries.

- Cruz looked petty and childish arguing with the moderators and whining about the candidates attacking him. It might endear him to his base in Iowa but I don’t think it’ll do much to make him any more palatable to the voters outside of the far-right that he needs to be a viable candidate to win the presidency. Rubio and Paul both hit him hard and he didn’t get much in the way of return. Was awkward when Wallace was pressing him on his total lack of allies in the Senate.

- Rubio floundered on cap-and-trade and didn’t receive much applause. Was on the defensive about immigration as well. Megyn Kelly really targeted him on that clip, and it showed. Not a standout performance by any means. Having to use Trump’s lines to deflect his perceived weakness on immigration looks sloppy. He’s definitely a loser of this debate alongside Cruz.

- Carson was mostly invisible and will likely continue to be so. “Putin is a one-horse country… oil… energy…”

- Jeb stumbled over his answers. He still looks awkward and untrained. However, despite his vocal stumbling, he took a stand on immigration while taking an easy shot at Rubio and looked good while doing it and fended off the rebuttal well. “So did you, Marco.” Got a lot of applause with the consensus line and easily took on Rubio. Not bad. Also looked very optimistic when talking about the YouTube entrepreneur, nice response; Rubio immediately tried to grab it.

- Christie being bellicose didn’t really make him stand out. He trotted out lines about Planned Parenthood and attacking Clinton and Obama but brought nothing new to the fight. Very unfortunate that he had to come out and say “I knew nothing,” if he was polling higher that would be an instant attack ad.

- Kasich had an unimpressive performance despite some thoughtful answers and a willingness to work with the Democrats that no other candidate really endorsed. Kasich had a strong point on Medicaid considering everyone else wants poor people to go without healthcare. Very strong on mental illness compared to other candidates.

Also credit to the mods, this was easily the best-moderated debate. Chris Wallace and Megyn Kelly were fantastic. Wallace shut down Cruz and then asked him about his total lack of friends on the Senate, and hit Christie hard on Bridgegate. Starting to think Trump knew it was going to be the hardest debate yet.

"Dropping in from north of the border to point out that Canada has much, much bigger banks compared to the size of the country than the US. The biggest Canadian bank has assets/GDP of about 0.46, and the second largest of just about the same. In the US, the biggest bank only has assets/GDP of about 0.15 - one-third of the relative size! - and the second largest is only about .12.

Canada actually has five banks that are far larger, relative to the size of the country (and hence the economy's capacity for a bailout) relative to any bank in the United States. Yet, there was no real financial crisis in Canada. 

If you keep going, you find that England has far larger banks than Canada. France has far larger banks than Canada. The United States is actually almost unique in the developed world for having a ton of relatively tiny banks!

Now go back to the financial crisis. Take Lehman. They were not a big bank. Relative to US GDP, they were holding assets/liabilities of about 3-and-a-half percent of GDP. Miniscule! The problem with Lehman is not size, it's leverage. 

Lehman was leveraged about 30:1 going into the crisis, meaning that it had borrowed (and invested) thirty dollars for every dollar of skin it put in the game itself. That means you need your investments to fall 3.5% to wipe your company out of existence. If you're not holding a largely secure portfolio, then, that means trouble.

To the extent one believes banks haven't learned anything from the crisis, and that they continue to face bad incentives for excessive risk-taking, and that the horde of new regulations hasn't done anything, the size of the banks is almost irrelevant, given that banks can make themselves thirty times larger than they seem.

No reasoned thought. No civil discussion. No critical thinking. Sketchy sources to say the least. Where has the intellectual debate gone?

Hillary Clinton is the leading candidate for the Democratic Nomination right now and if you actually read the column, you would understand that they made a choice based on pragmatism, which is OK! There are multiple points of view on every subject, unless you come to /r/politics. As a long time political observer, I was shocked to see in the sub outrageous statements made about the NYTs today.

&gt; Witnesses at trial, including a relative of the Hammonds, testified the arson occurred shortly after Steven Hammond and his hunting party illegally slaughtered several deer on BLM property.  Jurors were told that Steven Hammond handed out “Strike Anywhere” matches with instructions that they be lit and dropped on the ground because they were going to “light up the whole country on fire.”  One witness testified that he barely escaped the eight to ten foot high flames caused by the arson.  The fire consumed 139 acres of public land and destroyed all evidence of the game violations.  After committing the arson, Steven Hammond called the BLM office in Burns, Oregon and claimed the fire was started on Hammond property to burn off invasive species and had inadvertently burned onto public lands.  Dwight and Steven Hammond told one of their relatives to keep his mouth shut and that nobody needed to know about the fire.

Maliciously setting fire to US government property has a minimum sentence of 5 years.   The Hammonds didn't serve their full minimum sentence.  

&gt; “We all know the devastating effects that are caused by wildfires.  Fires intentionally and illegally set on public lands, even those in a remote area, threaten property and residents and endanger firefighters called to battle the blaze” stated Acting U.S. Attorney Billy Williams.

&gt; “Congress sought to ensure that anyone who maliciously damages United States’ property by fire will serve at least 5 years in prison.  These sentences are intended to be long enough to deter those like the Hammonds who disregard the law and place fire fighters and others in jeopardy.”",115

Despite Carl Levin's scathing admonishment of Goldman executives in court following/during the crisis, no legal wrongdoing was found by experts in the light of day (yes some individual traders were found guilty of fraud, but those were unrelated to the trades mentioned in the title). 

Let me ask you something: do the investors who took the other side of the Goldman bets not deserve blame for not doing their due diligence and losing billions of dollars on what were ultimately extremely risky bets? This article makes it seem like pension funds just blindly listen to whatever investment advice Goldman gives them, and that they're not responsible for proper vetting of those investments.

I don't believe that there is anything inherently different between rural and urban lifestyles and whether or not sex education is effective. 

Vermont, for instance, has the second lowest teen birth rate in the entire United States, and is a very rural state. In this case, I think we can quite confidently conclude that conservative views on sexual education are actually damaging. While it may not be the *only* factor driving higher teen birth rates and STD's, it certainly seems to be a predictable and material one.

"Lets put this in perspective with a quote from /u/elrod_enchilada:

&gt;This is a even more explosive issue than many realize. Hillary took $11.8 million in corporate speaking fees for 51 talks in 2014 and the first 3 months of 2015. These were 30-45 minute talks generally for around $225,000 a pop, though the price was as high as $350,000 for a few of them. Wall Street banks, big pharma, insurance and tech companies.
No other politician has ever done this mid-career: do a victory lap on Wall Street to collect vast amount of money to put in your personal bank account. Only a few retired politicians like Bill Clinton have ever done anything like this.
Hillary could only do this legally because she was not holding public office and she was not an announced candidate for president, though everyone on earth knew she was planning a run for the president. It was a loophole in the law she could exploit. Had Hillary accepted those speaking fees while a member of Congress or while Secretary of State it would have been illegal, a violation of ethics laws. Likewise, had she done so while an announced candidate it would have been illegal.
Even if Hillary claimed these speaking fees would have no effect on her conduct in public office, it is the appearance of impropriety that is key. People have a right to assume their government officials are not getting paid off. Her word or any politician's word is not good enough.
This was a way corporate America could influence Hillary legally and she could make herself fabulously wealthy. It reeks of corruption and is completely indefensible, which is why she so quickly changed the subject to President Obama getting campaign contributions when Bernie raised the issue of her Goldman Sachs speaking fees in the debate. She knows this single issue could very well destroy her candidacy. And if the Democrats don't press her now, just wait til Trump or Cruz sink their teeth into it. It makes her borderline unelectable. This issue highlights the basic lack of trust people already have in her, and draws her integrity and sincerity into question like nothing else.
It is important to remember that this $11.8 million did not go to her campaign warchest. It went to her personal bank account. She parlayed her prospective presidency into a cash cow.",707
"&gt; “I mean basically it’s also a very direct criticism of President Obama who, as you might recall, took a lot of money from the financial industry when he ran in 2008,” Clinton explained. “That didn’t stop him from fighting for the hardest regulations on Wall Street since the Great Depression, signing Dodd-Frank, getting everything he could get out of the Congress at that time.”

3. Trump vs Clinton - I think Trump takes this one. He's going to moderate himself a lot more once he gets the nomination, and enough people will be pissed at Clinton getting the nomination they will either stay home or vote trump in protest (especially if Trump can start to appeal to moderates, which I think he can).
4. Trump vs Sanders - Sanders probably takes it, but since your anti-establishment swing votes are split, it's a closer race.

Basically, to my mind the only way the republicans win is if they nominate Trump, and he runs against Clinton (that is in no way a sure thing, but that's my feeling). ",251

"See, the problem is that the only valid criticisms of Warren and Sanders are on policy issues.  Which is fine: policy is a matter of opinion to a large extent anyway; it's pretty hard to determine what effect a given policy will have until it's actually tried, so it's all theoretical.

With Hillary, many of the criticisms are much more personal, and are related to what appear to be corruption.  There's policy differences too, to be sure: her support of the TPP and NSA spying, for instance, are pretty big points.  But many of her actions, and those of her stooge Debbie Wasserman-Schulz, have been quite underhanded.

Personally, I'd rather vote for someone who I have some policy disagreements with, but who I think is overall a very honorable and above-board person (something that seems to be rare in politics these days) and who will generally try to do the right thing for the middle class (and lower classes too), rather than someone who steals some policy ideas from surprise-popular candidate but doesn't seem likely to actually back that talk up with actions after being elected, much like the current President, and who is obviously in the pocket of the big banks since they provide so much campaign funding for her.

"http://www.dol.gov/featured/minimum-wage/mythbuster

I understand the sentiment, and I'd feel the same without further research, but here's the thing. Prices will go up. But it will be exceedingly marginal ($500 to $1,000 / yr). That's because min wage is ONLY relevant for specific industries (primarily retail and food). Other industries are largely unaffected (housing, electrical, internet, TV, banking, etc).

So the average min wage worker would go from $15k to $30k per year, with maybe $1,000 more in food / retail costs.

And then you go small business. But these guys don't pay people min wage. The min wage guys are pretty much exclusively big business (walmart, McD's), large national chains. If you got 1 or 2 or 5 employees, you're going to be more cautious on who you hire and get someone decent. It's only when you got 500 (typical walmart) that you can start to treat them like cattle.

At the end of the day, min wage is wealth redistribution plain and simple, and that's all it is. The affect on the economy is null, or countered by the insane increase in consumer spending, and the affect on business only becomes relevant at min wage farms, not small business.

At the end of the day, the only question is: Should Walmart (et all) pay their workers enough to live and end government subsidies, or should the American people split the cost?

My understanding, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong, is that poorer communities that can least afford to be paying these ATM fees are the ones most often paying them due to a lack of physical banks in their area where they can make an in person withdrawal.
    
The issue is worsened by the fact that these people are generally withdrawing very small amounts of money, let's say $40-$60 as a guess, and paying $8 on average in ATM fees (the national average) which means they're paying up to 20% fees for the money they withdraw. Unfortunately when you're poor you don't have the option of reducing that percentage by taking out let's say $400 instead at which point that $8 fee is 2%, as opposed to 20% of the total value.
    
Sanders is trying to take on not only middle class issues but issues of the lower class who suffers the most and who are kept in perpetual poverty by a system that skims money off of them at every possible turn.

"Edit: Added article explaining what I was saying about the college supporter problem

I mean, he needs wins in Iowa and NH. Hillary already has big operations in the Super Tuesday states as well as NV and SC. It isn't just name recognition- she has the support of virtually every elected official, and that means a lot to some Dems. Bernie HAS to win Iowa (New Hampshire is an accomplishment, but he is the ""favorite son"" for that area). The reason Iowa matters is that it is demographically favorable to Sanders (white) and it has same day caucus registration. If Bernie can't win there, it is improbable that he could win NY or CO which have affiliation deadlines that are long past. 

Just going to add, you don't get bonus delegates if you have 500 college kids show up in one precinct. You will see some big Bernie crowds 2/1, but it may not be Statewide enough to pull him through. Sanders is leading in the three college towns, but down everywhere else.

They use Trump as a ratings tool, then endlessly bash him. I'm not saying they don't have a reason to, because we all know they certainly do -- but don't shamelessly sell out to establishment republicans while simultaneously chase ratings through hosting countless amounts of pointless, vitriolic Trump-centered ""debates"".

I was ordered to work in a hospital nearby pending being shipped off to the fleet with no training, no specialty, nothing. Two weeks after, I was hospitalized with severe mono.  It never was depression.  

Another 2-3 weeks after mono, now feeling truly depressed having lost everything, I laid down in my bed. I started reading the bible, hoping God would forgive me, and swallowed 13 ambien. I woke up 36 hours later sick and thirsty.  

I was an extremely gifted mathematician when I was younger, but was discarded for feeling blue. I was one of hundreds each year at the military.

"I've always thought it was ridiculous to tie healthcare to employment and require that it be an employee benefit. Most people know how it started, that during World War II we had wage controls on how much an employee's salary could be, so employers started offering health insurance as an added benefit because it circumvented these rules. Years later, the IRS created a tax rule that didn't count health benefits toward income and it's created strange incentives to stick with a system that works against both employers and their employees. 

From this policy paper:

&gt;Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that
comes with finally separating health insurance from employment. That freedom
would not only help the American people live happier, healthier and more fulfilling
lives, but it would also promote innovation and entrepreneurship in every sector of
the economy. People would be able to start new businesses, stay home with their
children or leave jobs they don’t like knowing that they would still have health care
coverage for themselves and their families. Employers could be free to focus on
running their business rather than spending countless hours figuring out how to
provide health insurance to their employees.

Looking at the math in his proposal, a worker making $50,000 a year will not only save ~$5600 a year on average but his employer will save $9500. Not to mention it provides healthcare to over 20 million Americans who have no coverage while removing copays and deductibles. This is really going to ~~change~~ save people's lives.",121

"I feel like now would be a good time to rehash something I said on an earlier college tuition thread.

I'm Australian, and we have a HECS (High Education Contribution Scheme) system, which is wonderful.

Rough Example: Every subject I take costs $1000. I am in a three year degree with four subjects a semester, making my costs $24,000. I pay that back as an additional tax out of my paycheck once I reach a certain income threshold. Everyone who attends or has attended university does this. Once I have paid off my $24,000, I no longer have to pay the tax.

All university degrees from all universities qualify for HECS, HECS is available to all Australian citizens (and I think Permanent Residents too). If you never reach the income threshold (which currently sits at about $54,000 a year), you never pay back your HECS debt.

University fees are also regulated, but I don't know the exact rules around it. I believe different degrees are sorted into bands based on median potential income and each has a maximum cost per year or semester or something before they disqualify themselves from government assistance. AGAIN, I want to state I don't know. That's just what I remember from my father telling me about uni before I enrolled.",375

"This is great. Trump and Rubio complain about the mainstream media? You've got to be kidding me. Rubio hasn't done anything interesting, and he's got similar coverage compared to Sanders.

I feel like this is the smoking gun. From the article:

&gt;Our analysis shows Bernie Sanders is being ignored by the mainstream media to a shocking degree. If covered at the average rate we’d have seen about 61,500 more stories including Sanders in the last 6 months: 91,094 mentions instead of 29,525.

&gt;Again, the poll numbers don’t explain the difference in coverage: Clinton’s poll-to-media-mention correlation, for example, is actually **negative** 48%. That means that news coverage goes up a little when her poll numbers drop. Sanders, on the other hand, sees no large benefit when his poll numbers rise (correlation = 11%).

&gt;For both Clinton and Sanders there’s a strong correlation between online search interest and news coverage: 90% and 77% respectively. All that means is that the lines in the graphs above follow the same trend. Search interest goes up, and so do the number of TV mentions. If Sanders received the same *volume* of mainstream press coverage that Clinton did based on search popularity the correlation could remain unchanged. The line for “national news mentions” would have the same ups and downs, but it would be *10 times* higher across the board.

And this comes from an author who admitted he'd planned to dispel the media bias ""conspiracy theories.""

On, BLM he was damned if he did, damned if he didn't. Move them aside and continue the speech people came specifically to see him make, and now he's a racist who doesn't care about black people.  It wouldn't have mattered what the truth is because the powers that govern only operate on a perception of truth and care nothing for facts.  He took the high road, let them speak, and his supporters responded in various ways.  I'm only one guy so I can't speak for all of them. It still doesn't change the fact that he cares enough to give them a voice when he didn't have to.

I don't know who you think black voters would be best served by voting for, but who else is even *talking* about getting the DOJ involved in every single instance where police take the life of someone?  Who else is even *talking* about the very concrete efforts, laid out plain as day, that they are going to take to move towards pay equity?  You know the answer.  You can be mad at his supporters all day.  Be mad at me.  I don't give a shit.  I'm probably saying a lot of the things you're sick of hearing.  I give up, I suck. You got me.  Just like super PACs, he doesn't have control over his supporters, only influence.  A great deal of us are disillusioned, angry, and often downright paranoid, but if you watch the debates and see how the media respects us so little they don't even *try* to hide it, maybe you can understand or see why.

On the Dr. King march, I don't know what to say.  If you can't be bothered to be impressed by that, I'm not sure what will impress you.  He believed in the man's vision enough to stand beside him when it really mattered and not when it was politically convenient, not when it was going to get him votes, and then he spent the *rest of his life* working to achieve the ideals of King's vision, or at least as close to it as we can manage on the scale of progress.

Lastly, he comes back to inequality because he believes that is the root.  If politics is corrupted by money, and money is the only kind of speech that matters in making the laws that govern our every day lives, how are the poor, the disenfranchised, and the disproportionately represented ever going to have a voice in how their lives are governed if that's how the game is played?  Poverty drives down development in areas, turns poor people against one another as they struggle and fight for crumbs, thus causing crime and violence to increase as well. People who have enought to get by aren't out there risking their life and freedom to commit violent acts just for the hell of it.  That is something only the desperate or the unwell would risk.

I appreciate your input, because I really do wonder about these sorts of things and what is going on in people's minds, but if you find Sanders supporters off putting because they are angry, desperate, and scared that this might be out country's last chance for real meaningful reform, I guess I understand.

"&gt; Allow me to let you in on a little secret: I, like presumably most Americans who support Bernie Sanders, do not expect miracles.
What I do expect, by electing Bernie Sanders, is to have an honest president whom Americans can trust at all times to be completely sincere, and who will work as hard as he can to represent the interests of the American people. By electing Bernie Sanders, I expect that the leader of our country will actually represent me and not just major corporations who are cutting him big checks. And no, I don't get the sense that Hillary Clinton possesses any of those qualities. Decidedly.

Count me among the educated, moderate, older, well off and realistic supporters of Sanders. I can just see that defeatism and maintaining the status quo won't move the country forward or make it a better place for my children and grandchildren. Sanders clearly has the best policies for the country. And I'm talking about the economy, health care, climate change and national security. He may not accomplish all of his big goals for the country but at least by trying he will begin the process and change the national dialog. I just can't stand the thought of eight more years of doing the same thing.",107

So, you could have a Top Secret clearance, and have access to certain programs, into which you were read, but not others.

Hillary's wording is a bit sneaky to say that she never sent anything marked ""classified"", because classified items are marked with their level and tag of classification.",130

"This is actually one of the most frequent insults I get when others find out I'm planning to vote for Bernie. They assume that I (and for the most part, other people in their 20s like myself) simply don't understand how the world works and that I'm just selfish and want free handouts. 

Well, when Republicans want to give billion dollar tax breaks to large corporations, wouldn't that be considered a hand out? 

There is just so much of a double standard. People get pissy when you start nitpicking the language people use, but the fact is that you HAVE to nitpick the language because that's what part of the issue is. Politicians say precisely what they mean to with exact words, you can't just generalize and assume the meanings.

Will they administer health benefits with federal funding like they do for Medicare? If not, then will they offer supplemental plans like private companies do in other countries with a single payer? Also, who decides and how do they decide which drugs, services, and procedures are covered by the single payer and which ones are not? It is financially impossible to cover every single product or service for healthcare with any hopes of a semblance existing to reduce costs and increase quality. For this issue, we would need a health technology assessment body that makes coverage decisions based on cost-effectiveness, like the rest of the single payer countries have. Bernie needs to state that he has solutions for these complexities, especially for transitionary periods between private payers to a single payer.

Additionally, the cost-savings the plan asserts are fantastic, but they are entirely contingent upon how effectively, smoothly, and quickly the transition can be implemented, not to mention, Congress. ",193

"I think Americans completely miss the point here.

True single payer health care removes nearly all financial decisions about health care from your life.  

Just your statement about getting PT on your knee floors me.  If I hurt my knee, I make an appt with my doctor, show my health card to the receptionist, wait my turn (usually less than an hour) and he orders x-rays, MRI, or anything else that is needed to make a proper diagnosis, then prescribes PT if it's required.

I book an appt with a registered therapist, again flash my health card, and receive my PT.  

Not once in that entire process do I ever think about how much I have paid in taxes to cover the costs of these services and I never have to worry if I can afford it.  I needed care and I get it.

So what if it does end up costing me a few hundred bucks a year more.  Not having to worry about whether I can afford simple doctor appointments or about going bankrupt because I need a $50,000 life saving surgery but my insurance only covers 60% and I have to take a loan out for the rest which I can't afford payments on is worth waaaaay more that those few extra hundred bucks a year.

"From [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/senate-bid-could-be-solution-for-wasserman-schultz-115373):

&gt;Throughout her time as chair, Wasserman Schultz has turned off colleagues, other top Democrats and current and former staff for a management style that strikes many as self-centered — even for a politician — and often at the expense of the DNC or individual candidates or campaigns. Many top Democrats, including some she counts as supporters and friends, privately complain about her trying to use the DNC as a vehicle for her own personal promotion, and letting her own ambition get in the way of larger goals.

&gt;Wasserman Schultz has a different sense of herself. According to people who spoke with her, **when she sensed Obama was considering replacing her as chair in 2013, she began to line up supporters to suggest the move was both anti-woman and anti-Semitic.** [Under fire last fall for her leadership](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/democrats-debbie-wasserman-schultz-111077.html), she took Obama’s decision not to remove her then as evidence of renewed strength and said she was confident no one could get her out of the DNC before her term is over at the beginning of 2017, according to sources who’ve spoken with her. She’s also been known to joke around the office about how having a vacation home in New Hampshire might one day be helpful in a presidential run.

"Hell, even culturally we've become a bunch of intellectualist workaholics who hate on people for doing honest manual labor just because it doesn't make them filthy rich.

We give people so much shit for working retail or working in warehouses or serving food or picking up garbage or doing construction or any number of truly necessary jobs that our country requires to function. Women look down at their children and they point at these people and they say ""you better go to college or else you'll end up like them!"" as if those people deserve punishment for not being savvy in the academic or business world. That right there is what is wrong with our country. This is why we can't get strangers to look at each other in the street and see each other as equals. This is what class warfare looks like.

Maybe someday the garbagemen will have to leave the garbage on the streets and the food service workers will drop their burgers on the ground and the contractors will stand idly by while the unfinished homes get rained on. A college degree isn't going to clean up the filth in the streets. A twenty year career in hedge fund managing isn't going to slaughter a cow, grill it and put it on the table. A sad housewife trying to raise a bunch of spoiled shits isn't going to be able to drop what she's doing and put enough nails in enough 2x4s to rebuild her damn house.

These people don't just deserve to be paid. They deserve respect for the work that they do. They don't deserve to be spat on and treated like slaves without rights or humanity. But many people in this country just refuse to accept that. If you work at burger king, you're lower than dirt. You're a failure, somehow. And for that reason, they probably shouldn't be paid at all.

there no such thing, the department that generated the content gets sole and final determination over classification. The state department can not take CIA classified information and deem it unclassified or change its classification in any way.

&gt;Third, and most importantly, is that since the beginning I have viewed this as an IT policy issue. Hillary did not setup her own IT server, she hired someone. 

to set up her own personal server, completely outside of the state department. that person went on to work for the state department after it was set up but when he set it up he was not a federal employee.



&gt;To do so someone at State had to give access to a 3rd party to setup a system.

 
Access to what exactly? she owned the domain, she owned the hardware, it was located in her home. it was not a @state.gov email address. there is absolutely no access the state department had to grant. In fact the state department had no idea that she used a personal email address for 100% of her emails until they tried to comply with the FOIA requests.

In fact it appears that it was collocated on the same server that ran the clinton foundation emails

&gt;Now, here's the important part: No one, not even the owner of the company, could circumvent this. If they did, they would be terminated.

If the company was privately owned it would be impossible to terminate the owner, who's going to tell him that he can longer be the owner? If it was publicly held then he is not the owner- the share holders are.

Our six-month old daughter was deprived of ever knowing her mother and I was left to raise her alone.  I didn't shed many tears; I didn't have any words, just a fury it seemed I could only articulate in the fistfights with the people stupid enough to insist the drunk hadn't actually murdered my wife.  I hurt people and I got my ass kicked a few times.  I got picked up by the local deputies, but since my family was friends with the sheriff and everyone pretended to understand my 'condition'. They either let me go home or sleep of my drunk in our tiny town jail.

Finally one afternoon in February that held the hint of spring in the air, I drove up to the Ben Franklin store and bought a baseball bat with the express intent of beating the drunk to death.  I didn't grab one of the many bats we had at home because my sisters played softball and it seemed perverse to kill a man with one of them.

I drove back home because I understood there would be a lot of blood and I didn't want to spoil my letterman's jacket.  I really wasn't myself at all, and I was fortunate because my youngest sister who had, and still has, an almost supernatural ability to read her brothers and sister's minds, was home and talked me out of beating the drunk to death with the bat I had bought expressly for that purpose.

"I know Sanders supporters hate hearing it, but Nate Silver explained back in July why Sanders shouldn't be expected to get a big boost out of Iowa and New Hampshire. 

Everything Silver explained then is equally applicable now.  Sanders still has very little support from non-white voters or moderate Democrats. His support is especially low among black voters, who make up a sizable portion of the voters in the post-NH states (mostly southern) through Super Tuesday. 

http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/bernie-sanders-could-win-iowa-and-new-hampshire-then-lose-everywhere-else/

&gt;I estimate that 54 percent of the voters in the New Hampshire Democratic primary were white liberals in 2008. That’s the second-highest figure in the country,2 after Vermont (59 percent). In the Iowa caucus, meanwhile, white liberals made up 50 percent; that put the state in a tie with Massachusetts for the third-highest percentage.
&gt;
The percentage of white liberals isn’t so high in other early primary states, however. It’s just 29 percent in Nevada and 19 percent in South Carolina. The percentage is also low in high-population, delegate-rich states like California (26 percent) and Texas (17 percent).
&gt;
Put another way, Iowa and New Hampshire aren’t representative of the more diverse electorates that Democrats will turn out elsewhere. It just so happens that the idiosyncrasies of the first two states match Sanders’s strengths and Clinton’s relative weaknesses.
&gt;
Clinton performed well among Hispanic voters in 2008, and while her failure to win African-American votes was a central reason her campaign failed, she now has excellent favorability ratings among black voters that are nearly as high as Barack Obama’s. If Clinton begins to see her support erode among those groups, her campaign will have some real reason for concern. Otherwise, just as was the case throughout the 2008 campaign, the media will misconstrue voting patterns that occur because of demographics and attribute them to “momentum” instead.",159

When talking about single-payer healthcare she goes on about how she doesn't want to get back into a contentious debate. Like really you're afraid of a debate? 

If she would say ""I think single-payer is a good idea and where we should try to head but I don't think it's viable in the current political climate"" then I'd agree that she'd be the pragmatist that her supporters say she is. But what she currently says is more like lip service to make you think she supports single-payer while she really works to protect the monied interests of the current system.

I hope she doesn't win the primary. But I will absolutely be voting for her if she does. I cannot stomach the idea of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, or Donald Trump getting to name Supreme Court justices.

"[From the actual Politifact article](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jan/13/how-much-would-bernie-sanders-health-care-plan-cos/):

&gt;By our napkin calculations, those making more than $200,000 — roughly the top 5 percent of income earners — would contribute about $117 billion to the single-payer system, while everyone else would pay in $126 billion. Payroll taxes yield an additional $432 billion for a total of $675 billion.

&gt;**That’s still $599 billion short of what the country actually spent on health care in 2013 ($949 billion in premiums and $325 billion for out-of-pocket expenses, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services).**

&gt;Sanders says his system would make up for that shortfall by trimming costs, as the government would have more leverage to negotiate with health providers.

&gt;Experts agreed that single-payer gets you more bang for your buck by reducing administrative overhead, hospital and doctor's’ fees, and prescription drug prices. But some say Sanders is overestimating the potential reductions.  

&gt;**With Sanders’ proposed taxes, costs would need to be trimmed by roughly 42 to 47 percent — a tall order when ""the most generous estimates of how much you could cut cost are on the order of 20 percent,"" said Sherry Glied, a professor of health policy and economics at New York University who’s served in the George H.W. Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations.**

"My takeaways from the debate.


The moderation was very spotty. There were points where nobody had any idea who was supposed to be talking. This happened mostly during the issue of healthcare. Otherwise, they were pretty good at keeping it fair between Sanders and Hillary at the expense of O'Malley, who seemed to only get a word in when he would interject or disagree with something. I also really enjoy how when they went to commercial break at any point, they wouldn't let any one of the candidates interrupt the break and get a last word in. They were very tough.


Hillary is trying very hard to mislead people about Sander's healthcare plan and the moderators also tried calling him out on raising taxes while ignoring the relief of not paying insurance premiums. I understand that there's a stigma against raising taxes, but when taxes are taking the place of premiums or other things we no longer have to pay for, it's a bit of a cheap shot to call it out as if we would be paying more when we wouldn't be.


Sanders does sounds like a broken record on the Wall Street stuff, but I don't think people understand just how much of an effect it has and has had on our economy. 


 O'Malley really needed to be on the stage tonight. In my view, he serves as a great middle-ground candidate that agrees some with Bernie, and some with Hillary and it was refreshing to have somebody that encouraged the civil discussion that incorporates everyone's values. 


Hillary continues this act of using military force as if it's all just great and we should totally get behind it. I think more and more people are becoming wise to the futility of having so much of a military presence in the Middle-East and I think O'Malley and Sanders hit the nail on the head when they said that we should be working in coalition with other countries to take out ISIS, something that a lot of republicans I know get behind as well.

I enjoyed this debate, but I really wish they wouldn't jab so much at the Republican party and then talk about unifying the country. 


I think that Sanders will get a much larger following than we've seen given how he was the most googled candidate of the three during the debate, but that's just a hunch on my part.

I have nothing but respect for Martin O'Malley.",328

I personally do believe Sanders would be the most beneficial president for the US people, perhaps even manage to change some things in how the government works if people follow up with electing proper congress members.

While Clinton would be a decent president in herself, but she will just continue the status quo. Government wouldnt change it would continue on its current path. Certain things would get better. She would be more qualified for Foreign Policies. But what the US needs right now is not foreign benefits, but internal.

Going around stating that you wont vote for Hillary just because Sanders didn't get the nomination, is very short-sighted and destructive. As a GOP president out of the current selection, with perhaps the exception of Rand, would be destructive of both local and foreign benefits.",177

"Most of politics is jargon.  People are against Bernie because he talks of class warfare and revolution, but his policies are really not all that controversial. 

Increased infrastructure spending?  This has long been considered a tool to help grow the economy when it is stagnate.  See: Tennessee Valley Authority.

Break up monopolies?  See: the Sherman Antitrust Act

Increased taxes on the wealthy?  We already have a progressive tax system and one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world when accounting for state + federal taxes. It's  not a revolutionary concept, it's just a tax increase, plain and simple.

Single Payer healthcare? While this would be new and change America's health insurance industry drastically, it's not a new concept in the world, and it's  been something talked about in American politics for 20+ years.  Hell, the supposed AntiBernie on the right, Trump, proposed the same system. Mitt Romney even supported a similar concept.

Free/affordable public secondary education? This is not uncommon elsewhere in the world. We already have free/affordable public education for K-12, it's not radical to extend the idea to college.


Bernie is not a radical in terms of his policy suggestions. In fact, virtually every position he has is an old idea or an expansion of a current policy.  Now, there's  differing views on all those concepts and policies and whether they are effective or not, but none of it is particularly ""radical"".

The thing about Bernie that is radical is his rhetoric. Sanders employs the rhetoric of socialists like Debs, Trotsky, Marx, Engels, Lenin, etc. about revolution and unfairness/exploitation to rally a populist base around his cause that emotionally identify with the anger they feel at the system and their perceived outcomes from it.  And yes, whether you want to admit it or not, a lot of Bernie supporters are there because of the rhetoric about ""fairness"" and ""Wall Street Greed"", and the 1% and the divisive language he uses.  But at the end of the day, 99% of that is all just rhetoric. All that remains is policy, on which Bernie is progressive, but not all that radically so.  This isn't the Ron Paul of the Left, and this isn't Debs.  Just a progressive with a new way of rallying support to his ideas.

I'm not even a Bernie fan, myself, but most of the rhetoric used to describe him by detractors and supporters is nothing more than rhetoric.",183

"For those of you who have never been to Kentucky I probably should shed some light on the Commonwealth. Kentucky is very similar to New York, in that it is a mixture of very urban and very rural areas. We have cities like Louisville which culturally speaking isn't that much different than someplace like Seattle with some southern charm thrown in there, while at the same time large portions of the state are either agricultural based or based around the coal mining industry. 

What you are seeing right now is the urban base and the agricultural base basically teaming up against the coal portion which is primarily in Eastern Kentucky. Eastern Kentucky areas are some of the poorest areas while at the same time have their primary industry under heavy attack with no suitable replacement in sight. The Agricultural areas are actually doing fairly well and view the Eastern part of the state as Welfare/Disability queens as that area has disproportionately large percentage of their population drawing from those services. Cities like Louisville only see about 60% of their tax money returning to their city while Eastern Kentucky receives significantly more than they pay in. This draws the ire of your economic engines across the board. Couple that with the heavy influence the coal industry has had in Frankfort over the years with shaping policies, benefits, services and tax codes and you've created a situation where people are fed up with that section of the state.  They even had a special tax that was setup to build a trust fund to help transition Eastern Kentucky off of coal, which they've failed to utilize. I was shocked at the election (at least the GOP primary results, the DNC's national policies are so toxic here that the general didn't surprise me) as much as everyone else, but when you ask anyone over the age of 40 they immediately go into a rant about how he's doing these policies to clean up Eastern Kentucky and get them off the government's dime. ""He's a business guy! If anyone can bring industry into that area to get Eastern working again it's him."",  ""He's going to cut off the gravy train (to Eastern) and get them contributing again!"", ""Something has to be done we are running out of money and we can't raise taxes any higher we are already losing industry and companies to Tennessee, if anyone can fix it it's him."" are typically what you hear depending on the demographic of the person you are talking to.

"Scalia has a selective boner for historical interpretation, and here, he is forwarding a historical argument against what seems to be the plain text of the 1st Amendment.

So, in this particular instance, he is doing exactly the opposite of what you think he's doing. He is not discussing the letter of the law, because under his (again, selectively adopted) school of interpretation, it is impossible to rely solely on plain text. One must delve into historical context and therefore the intent of the authors.

One systemic problem with historical interpretation is that it's very easy to arbitrarily stop digging for evidence (context) whenever one feels like it. Scalia leverages this problematic aspect of historical interpretation to its hilt. There is plenty of evidence to support his position... if you focus on that evidence exclusively and refuse to go digging for anything else.

For example: it should be undisputed, historically speaking, that religion-in-general enjoyed far more popularity than absence-of-religion in the colonies before, during, and after the authoring of the Bill of Rights. It is also a fact that many state constitutions explicitly favored religion over non-religion (usually Christian religions, surprise surprise.) It is also a fact that virtually none of the Founding Fathers professed 'pure' atheism in any of their surviving documents.

By focusing on these pieces of historical evidence/context and ignoring others, one may weave together a fairly convincing pastiche that suggests that nobody was really serious about allowing absence-of-religion a fair shake in the United States of America.",107

Likewise they asked her about the campaign contributions and she said, ""look, we all do this."" It was just overall an extremely weak segment.

Sanders had some pretty bad moments as well. His gun issue section was TERRIBLE, although he is fortunate that it happened at the beginning so he had nowhere but up to go from there. Missing the youtube question was bad too, but it may be due to technical error (I hope it wasn't just him being old and hard of hearing). He redeemed himself by nailing the answer though, which was about police violence.

Hillary's strongest moment was towards the end on Flint, Michigan, where she basically showed why she's got such strong African American support. Sanders had a weak ending - they asked him what issue he'd like to bring up that was not discussed and he went with Wall Street. Its a pet peeve of mine with Sanders.

I think Sanders strongest moment was when he talked about health insurance. He stood his ground and honestly, I am now firmly convinced that I really, really would love to never have to deal with a damn health insurance company again.

Sanders, on the other hand, is vehemently against things like the prison industrial complex (which Clinton has profited from, which jails women of color at a much higher rate than other offenders), income inequality (which hurts poor queer people, esp. if they're kicked out of the house for coming out), lack of education access (which helps build and inform movements), and the current health insurance industry (useful for trans folks, people using PrEP, disability). Those issues hurt straight and queer men, yes, but they hurt women in similar *and* different ways, but in ways that I feel that Sanders addresses more specifically. They might not seem like queer or women issues at first, but once you delve deep enough to see how those precise communities are impacted, you can identify and zero in on how to deal with them. 

So in many ways, Sanders has listed as campaign issues things that would boost feminism so much in this country, but a type of feminism that places more emphasis on helping poor and/or minority women, which is something that Clinton's campaign is sorely missing. A feminism that ignores the variety of women out there (and their allies) for the sake of a certain type of woman isn't true feminism at all.

It's a fair question, I suppose, but read the text for your answer. It isn't the reporters coming up with the ""throw them out"" language. Trump demanded that the protesters be, in his own words, thrown out, and thrown out harshly.

&gt; ""Throw them out into the cold,"" Trump ordered security, as protesters shouted ""Bernie! Bernie!"" during his rally Thursday night in Burlington, Vt.

and

&gt; ""It's about 10 degrees below zero outside... You can keep his coat; tell him we'll send it to him in a couple of weeks,"" Trump told security.

Is that the kind of petty, vindictive man you want running the USA?

Sanders, on the other hand, did not insist on any such petty harsh treatment. Sanders *did* respond to his protesters: 

&gt; “Here’s a Trump supporter worried about Mr. Trump’s money,” Sanders said, prompting boos from the crowd that quickly turned into chants of “Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!”

I'm just pointing out a sensationalist title that implies a news outlet (MSNBC) thinks you should think a certain way; which IRONICALLY is coming from a new aggregate outlet (Reddit) which vehemently attempts to thrust Sanders on you, and typically floods you with downvotes for dissenting opinions. And of course, this sensationalist title is coming from a......... wait for it..... Bernie Sanders submission.

Some of the Sanders supporters backlash comments I'm seeing are disappointing; my point was missed completely. I'm not being anti-Sanders, I'm being anti-sensationalist and anti-hypocrisy.

It's not terribly complex. The basic argument is that if Walmart pays its employees little enough that they consistently qualify for subsidies, Walmart has de facto shifted some of its payroll costs to the taxpayer.  Since they reap the difference in profits, they are in effect being subsidized by the government.

Estimates are around [7.8 billion](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/walmart-government-subsidies-study) in additional profits for Walmart at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer.

&gt;“This report shows that our current system is anything but fair – rather it provides special treatment to America’s biggest corporations and richest families leaving individual taxpayers and small businesses to pick up the tab,” the report concluded.

&gt;The $7.8 billion includes an estimated $6.2 billion in public assistance for low-wage Walmart employees, including programs like food stamps, subsidized housing, and Medicaid. It also includes an estimated $70 million per year in “economic development subsidies” from state and legal governments eager to host Walmart in their cities.

Edit: 

If you're wondering if that $7.8 billion is the difference in profitability or not for Walmart, [here are their net incomes](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/wmt/financials) after expenditures and taxes for the years 2011-2015: 

2011 - $15.36 Billion  
2012 - $15.77 Billion  
2013 - $17 Billion  
2014 - $15.88 Billion  
2015 - $16.18 Billion  

They don't need the subsidies to be profitable, but because they can pay their employees less, they've roughly doubled their profitability in each of the last 5 years on the backs of American taxpayers. IMO, it's unpatriotic and shows a disregard for their workers.

"Breaking up the banks actually means at least three things. please feel free to add more if anyone thinks of any.

1 - you want to break up business lines. this goes back to the glass-steagall idea, but updates it to recognize how the industry has changed. this can mean that investment banking shouldn't happen in the same company as traditional retail banking, or that commercial banks should limit their derivatives and securities financing activities to those which are inherently related to their core business. 

2 - you want to reduce concentration of assets so that more banks have smaller shares of the industry. we already require that banks can't merge if they would hold more than 10% of the country's insured deposits. this would allow banks to go out of business without taking large swaths of the economy with them. 

3 - you want to break up the political (* and market) power. if banks had to divest of certain business lines, they would then be competing with insurgent companies that want those business lines. furthermore, people in different business lines would have different financial goals. now the people shaping the market are fighting each other over business - this competition means control of regulation as well as other market operations are not decided by a small set of financially and politically powerful actors. 

As to your question about the entire industry - if it turns out that more competition and less centralized power is more efficient, it is likely that the industry would end up being a smaller share of the economy. It could also be that there's a tradeoff and we end up with a larger, less efficient but possibly more stable financial sector - but it's incredibly hard to perform that kind of cost benefit analysis, because it's hard to know how bad a crisis will be.

People who support breaking up the banks generally believe that impact of crises are large enough that it's worth the trade-off even if the system becomes less day-to-day efficient, as opposed to a super efficient machine that fails catastrophically every once in a while.

edit: this is as concise as I could think to make the issue, but also leaves lots of important ideas out - for example there's only passing mention of which activities the government should or shouldn't subsidize like deposit insurance. ",570

"Many state supreme courts have concluded that compliance with those single-subject rules is not subject to judicial review. Or those courts have interpreted the rules so broadly that nothing ever fails the single-subject test. E.g. the subject of a bill is ""spending,"" so anything to do with spending is fair game.

And if courts are willing to rigorously enforce single subject rules, the results aren't pretty. According to [this paper](http://weblaw.usc.edu/assets/docs/Matsusaka_Aggressive_Enforcement.pdf), aggressively enforced single-subject rules are an invitation to partisan judicial decision-making. The paper focuses on judicial review of initiatives, but I don't see why a legislative single subject rule would be any different. Here is the abstract:

&gt;Most states require voter initiatives to embrace only a single subject, and courts have invalidated many initiatives for violating the single subject rule. Critics argue that the definition of a “subject” is infinitely malleable, so that if judges attempt to enforce the single-subject rule aggressively, their decisions will be based on their personal views rather than neutral principles. We investigate this argument by studying the decisions of state appellate court judges in five states during the period 1997–2006. We find that judges are more likely to vote to uphold an initiative against a single subject challenge if their partisan affiliations suggest they would be sympathetic to the policy proposed by the initiative. More important, we find that partisan affiliation is highly consequential in states with aggressive enforcement of the single subject rule — **the rate of voting to uphold an initiative jumps from 41 percent when a judge agrees with the policy to 83 percent when he disagrees** — but not very consequential in states with restrained enforcement. The evidence suggests that it may be possible to apply the single subject rule in a neutral way when the judiciary is restrained, but with aggressive enforcement decisions are likely to driven by the political preferences of judges.

Are you not concerned that if Hilary beats Bernie in the primary, you are going to alienate that youth vote, and Hilary won't be able to motivate people to go out and vote (not losing the election to the republicans, just not motivating her base enough to win)?

2. This election seems to have 2 narratives. One is the standard Democrat vs Republican, but the other is establishment vs non-establishment. I think what a lot of Hilary supporters are missing is that a lot of people feel VERY strongly about voting in a non-establishment candidate. That means that if Hilary comes up against Trump, you may lose votes not because of his policies, but because he is not an ""establishment"" candidate. I think this feeling is very strong in the youth, and unless you nominate your own non-establishment politician (Bernie) you put yourself at huge risk. Basically, those voters happy to vote in an establishment politician are more likely to fall in line and vote party lines (no matter who the nominee) than those who are angry at the political system and want SOMEONE different.

From all the doctors that have refused me, I ""shouldn't be in this pain, I'm too young"" well, I'm also too young to have had multiple retinal tears by my late teens. Too young to have had to see a glaucoma specialist at 20. Too young for most of what I have from the first two conditions... But the fear that doctors have is all the same.

"Look at his financial record in Burlington and in his presidential campaign. Personal finances are much more subjective to personal goals, tendencies, etc. than the finances of a city or national campaign. He was extremely effective at managing Burlington's finances and his campaign is about as lean and cost-effective as it gets for someone who isn't already a celebrity (such as Trump).

In 2011/2012 he donated 100% of the money he earned from book sale royalties to charity, ~$26,000 in total. http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/04/30/17261/12-things-know-about-bernie-sanders

If someone wasn't comfortable with their personal finances, they wouldn't donate $26,000 of their income to charity, so I think it's fairly safe to say he's reached his personal goals. This is a guy who doesn't plan on retiring, has substantial pensions payments for the rest of his and his wife's lives, and lives very frugally.

"From another redditor:


If you're under 50 you really need to read this. If you’re over 50, you lived through it, so share it with those under 50. When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume authority over a health care reform. Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn’t even get a vote in a democrat-controlled congress. This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.

Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general. Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood – both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration. Next she chose Janet Reno – husband Bill described her selection as “my worst mistake.” Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.

Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovered of Ms. Guanier’s radical views, her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.

Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations. She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department. Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.

Many younger votes will have no knowledge of “Travelgate.” Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson – and the White House Travel Office refused to comply. She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired. This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a thirty-six month investigation. Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds. A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours. Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security. When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone and, of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House. Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.

Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the “bimbo eruption” and scandal defense. Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle were: • She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit. After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones. • She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor. After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about and later admitting his affairs.

Hillary’s devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.

Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice during the Starr investigation by repeating, “I do not recall,” “I have no recollection,” and “I don’t know” a total of 56 times while under oath.

After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, china, and artwork that she had stolen.

What a swell party – ready for another four or eight year of this type low-life mess? Now we are exposed to the destruction of possibly incriminating e-mails while Hillary was Secretary of State and the “pay to play” schemes of the Clinton Foundation – we have no idea what shoe will fall next. But to her loyal fans - “what difference does it make?”

And just think, since leaving the White House, the Clinton's, through 2014, have made $221,139,576.00 and BOTH are drawing taxpayer funded U. S. Government pensions.

"This will probably get buried but...
Of course Hillary Clinton has a plan, and has published a plan. She just doesnt repeat it in everyone of her speeches or debates, nor does she use it as a common theme for her presentation.

Sanders Campaign is genius in that he focuses on, what he feels to be, the most important issues-both for his voters and for his potential presidency. He hammers away at income inequality and health care in every single event.

It is incredibly obvious if you are a critic of Sanders, which much of the democratic base and all of the GOP is, that if a candidate is repeatedly pushing one topic over and over again, a topic that is incredibly new and extensive, such as reforming the entire healthcare system into a single payer system, that there should be a rational next step of asking: How are you going to do it? Its not an unfair question at all, and it should be one Sanders, if he feels that strongly about the effects of a single payer system, should be ready and willing to answer.

As for foreign war and surveillance? This is America. No matter who is in the white house, Democratic or Republican, the Pentagon is handed a blank check. I love to support Barrack Obama, but he is no different.

Now as far as Hillary Clinton's plan goes, just visit her website. She has, albeit, an incredibly simple and straight foward, outline on foreign policy as president.
Her national security campaign info can be found here:
https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/national-security/

An excerpt from this passage reads: (Excuse me for my lack of Reddit formatting skills)

""Never allowing Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. America and our allies, especially Israel, will be safer if we vigorously enforce the nuclear agreement with Iran and implement a broader strategy to confront Iran’s bad behavior in the region.

Defeating ISIS. ISIS and the foreign terrorist fighters it recruits pose a serious threat to America and our allies. We will confront and defeat them in a way that builds greater stability across the region, without miring our troops in another misguided ground war. Hillary will empower our partners to defeat terrorism and the ideologies that drive it, including through our ongoing partnership to build Iraqi military and governing capacity, our commitment to Afghanistan’s democracy and security, and by supporting efforts to restore stability to Libya and Yemen.

Holding China accountable. As secretary of state, Hillary reasserted America’s role as a Pacific power and called out China’s aggressive actions in the region.  As president, she’ll work with friends and allies to promote strong rules of the road and institutions in Asia, and encourage China to be a responsible stakeholder—including on cyberspace, human rights, trade, territorial disputes, and climate change—and hold it accountable if it does not.

Standing up to Putin. Hillary has gone toe-to-toe with Putin before, and she'll do it again. She'll stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our European allies and help them decrease dependence on Russian oil. With our partners, Hillary will confine, contain, and deter Russian aggressions in Europe and beyond, and increase the costs to Putin for his actions. ""

No candidate in 2016 would seek to run on the ""I want to start global wars and massive global surveillance"" idea, and thus candidates seldom make it their theme for the presentations.

This threw me for a bit of a loop but, as we were outside a hardware store, I said I'd buy him a roll. We went into the store and got to talking.

He was 73 years old, same age as my Dad. He couldn't walk too well, he was kinda crunched over. Turns out he lives in his van and the reason he wanted duct tape was to fix a window at the back of the van to keep out the wind.

He had worked in retail for fifty years but never could afford to buy a home. He retired at 70 and lost his rental property not long after that. He's been living in the van ever since.

Honestly, the general goal in the sanders sub was to get to low 40s nationally by iowa, with about a 15 point gap. Winning Iowa has by far been our biggest focus, and there's been a huge phone banking push there. This is a really stunning poll. An outlier currently (well HRC's number at least, 39 seems to be consistent for bernie), so we'll have to wait and see, but it's impressive nonetheless. Even if bernie loses, it's impressive as hell what he's been able to do. Who would've thought 8 years ago a self labeled democratic socialist would be a serious contender for president?

"Gotta' wonder what the United States would look like today had it not been for the past six years of Republican obstructionism.  Remember that President Obama *wanted* Elizabeth Warren to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he wanted *her* to be the one out there prosecuting corporate crime.  Instead we got Dodd Frank, which has been getting its teeth pulled ever since it passed, and almost universal opposition to the CFPB from our Republican friends.  
  
This shouldn't be read as a challenge towards Clinton, Sanders, *or* Obama, this should be seen as a challenge to the American people to elect a **Congress** that is willing to regulate their own SuperPAC donors.  Don't think Secretary Clinton is progressive enough?  Elect a Congress that will drag her to the Left with every bill they write.  Don't think Senator Sanders has the chops to lead the country?  Elect a Congress that won't spend six years trying to throw him under the bus.  
  
The power of the President is *puny* compared to the power of Congress.  (Again, just look at how effectively they've blocked nearly every reform and protection that's been proposed in the past six years.)  Yes, challenge Secretary Clinton, challenge Senator Sanders, but also challenge your Representatives, your Congressmen, your Governor, your Mayor; hell, challenge the City Dog Catcher while you're in the voting booth.  Don't just vote for reform in *one* political office, instead vote in reformers for *all* your political offices.  Vote for a Mayor who wants to enact municipal fiber optic internet to fight against Comcast *and* the Governor who wants more oversight for the financial institutions in your state.  
  
TL;DR: The Presidency is just a small part of a much larger whole.  If we want to see real, honest to God reforms we need to elect a cooperative Congress, competent Governors, and we need active, ongoing participation in local and national politics.  No single person, no single elected office can fix these systemic problems on his or her own.  
  
Edit: And I'll just put this out there too: I know a lot of people feel that Secretary Clinton would be too gentle with the Too Big to Fail Banks (I'm not sure that I disagree either), but we have another option.  We can force action on the part of a potential President Clinton by sending her a Congress loaded with Senators and Representatives eager to regulate the Big Banks.  Remember how this Congress has ""repealed"" the Affordable Care Act sixty times, and President Obama has been forced to veto those ""repeals"" sixty times?  Make Secretary Clinton choose between standing with a Progressive Congress and the American people or standing with Goldman Sachs by vetoing new legislation; make her choose over and over again, make her sign the same veto over and over again, give her plenty of opportunities to change her vote.  I'll also note that a progressive Congress is exactly what Senator Sanders is hoping for in 2016, and every Republican Presidential candidate is hoping against.  I'll reiterate again: Electing a progressive Congress, Senate, and local government is crucially important regardless of your stance on Clinton versus Sanders.  Even if the ""wrong"" candidate wins the Primary it's still important that we *all* get to the polls and vote in November.  (Write in someone for President if you have to, but vote.)

Then there is the added benifit to the economy. If everyone has excess to good healthcare, your labour force will be bigger. Less people will put off going to the doctor untill it is too late. People that are treated properly can work better etc. Then there is the effect on spending power. When people don't have absurd medical costs, they can spend more which boosts the economy

Thats just for the planes. They also have every other kind of unit you can think of, from Combat Engineers to SEALs. They have an insane amount of military power for a single state. Yet still pay more taxes than they get for it.  

Little Massachusetts and Jersey get 75% of what Florida does, yet pay a huge surplus, while Florida is in a huge deficit. There is simply no truth to the idea that most military spending goes to Republican states. 

People need to stop saying Republican states only spend a lot of money because of the military. It's untrue and it's insulting to the troops to try and blame this on them. 

Edit: to clarify, The federal government does not give the money to the state for the federal military, but it's still counted as tax dollars spent in the state. The only problem is that it does not explain the discrepancy between red and blue states. Which is what Republicans are trying to say. That it's the military's fault they overspent. When in reality it was non-military expenditures.

If the Democrats also get the same amount of military money or more, why is their total lower? Because it's not military money causing the imbalance, as Republicans claimed.

"Yup, the same thing has happened to Trump from CNN and he points it out to them.  For example, The Des Moines Register had an Iowa poll that had Ted Cruz at like 28 to Trump 27, whilst CNN's own poll had Cruz at 20 to Trump's 33.  CNN completely ignored their own poll and only reported on the Cruz beating Trump poll.  It was funny because Trump was like, ""Your poll was more professionally done and you guys spent a lot of money on it, but you won't even quote your own poll, you choose to use someone else's poll because it doesn't look as good for me.""

They are 100% doing this on purpose to Bernie too now.  It's funny because the next 2 polls to come out of Iowa showed the CNN poll to likely have been more accurate as Trump had a 9 pt and 11 pt lead in the other ones.  CNN is very dishonest.",525

"Let's talk about WHERE he's making these statements. I attended this rally today, since it was held on my college campus.

Dordt College is a firmly rooted conservative Christian institution and we don't take our faith lightly. Nonetheless, we're an institution dedicated to opportunity and education and will not turn away any presidential candidates, including liberals and people like Donald Trump. This is the 7th candidate to visit campus this election season. Because this area is so conservative, the announcement that he was coming caused an uproar. 

While you don't expect the man to change his persona for a campus, you would expect a little respect. This rally was held in our chapel because it was the only space large enough for the expected turnout. We worship in this building weekly, and hearing Donald Trump announce that he can shoot someone and still get votes is disgusting. On top of his arrogance and hate speech, he used language (hell, bullshit, etc.) he must know is edgy. 

The most insulting part of this rally was the blatant attempt to appeal to the Christian audience. He had Dr. Jeffress introduce him with a prayer that was full of buzzwords and included the words ""make America great again."" Then, Trump comes out and instantly starts talking about how he wanted to take along pictures of himself at a Presbyterian communion to prove he is a Christian, and proceeds to brag about his supposed faith. What a joke. I don't want proof in pictures, I want to see him act like Jesus Christ. Unfortunately he cannot do that in the slightest. Donald Trump is just another liar trying to please as many people as possible. 

EDIT: The polarizing response to this comment is both interesting and not surprising. Thanks for sharing your thoughts either way. I know that Christians are generally not well respected on reddit, but generalizations are always going to be the ignorant route. We all know what happens when we make assumptions... To be clear: My Christian faith has the single largest influence on the choices I make, and I won't apologize for that. ~~I think we can all agree that it's a dangerous road to start making people feel bad for their beliefs. RE: Freedom of Religion.~~ 

EDIT 2: I shouldn't have written the text in strikethrough. Thank you for pointing out the hypocrisy and fallacy of that statement, especially coming from a Christian. My religious beliefs lead to my moral convictions, which in turn lead to my actions. Everyone has the right to criticize me on that, and that's fine! I'm glad you all challenged me on the text in strikethrough, because you are completely right. Thank you!",564

"Oh, there's more to him:  

In 1997, Michael Wayne Haley was arrested after stealing a calculator from Walmart. This was a crime that merited a maximum two-year prison term. But prosecutors incorrectly applied a habitual offender law. Neither the judge nor the defense lawyer caught the error and Haley was sentenced to 16 years.  

Eventually, the mistake came to light and Haley tried to fix it. Ted Cruz was solicitor general of Texas at the time. Instead of just letting Haley go for time served, Cruz took the case to the Supreme Court to keep Haley in prison for the full 16 years.  

The case reveals something interesting about Cruz’s character. Ted Cruz is now running strongly among evangelical voters, especially in Iowa. But in his career and public presentation Cruz is a stranger to most of what would generally be considered the Christian virtues: humility, mercy, compassion and grace. Cruz’s behavior in the Haley case is almost the dictionary definition of pharisaism: an overzealous application of the letter of the law in a way that violates the spirit of the law, as well as fairness and mercy.

"The Founding Fathers put in the ""natural-born citizen"" provision in the Constitution to preclude anyone loyal to Great Britain making a run for the Presidency. They feared divided loyalties. So they placed in a provision that said that a President has to be a ""natural-born citizen"". Not a citizen. Let's repeat that: The provision doesn't say that you have to be a *citizen,* as Cruz advocates keep repeating; it says you have to meet the higher threshold of being a *natural-born* citizen.

For most of US history, a ""natural-born citizen"" was taken to be 1) someone born on US soil, and 2) Someone both of whose parents were Americans.

Why both? Because the Founders didn't want the child to have dual citizenship to any other nation. (The whole ""divided loyalties"" thing). The Founders didn't believe in dual citizenship. In fact, they outlawed it. It was only allowed to happen in the mid-20th Century. [See the 1967 case of Bays Afroyim.]

Mr. Cruz tends to claim that he wants the Constitution interpreted as the Founders wrote it. Well?

The Founders who banned dual citizenship . . .

Did they want a dual citizen in the highest office of the land?

Did they want someone born on foreign soil in the Chief Executive's office?

And here's the kicker: Cruz, born on Canadian soil, was born a Canadian citizen--which makes him a British subject [due to Canada being part of the Commonwealth]. He's exactly the OPPOSITE sort of person the Founders wanted seeking the highest office.

""Eek! A Redcoat!""

Cruz's father, a Cuban national, obtained Canadian citizenship. Cruz's American born mom (as the evidence mounts) also became a Canadian citizen. [See the recent article of her name being on Canada's voter roster. Only citizens are allowed to vote. So why is her name on the roster?]

So Ted was born to two Canadian citizens on Canadian soil.

The Founding Fathers would have considered him unambiguously a Canadian. Hence ineligible to run for President.

""But . . . but . . . I'm a dual citizen through my mother!""

The Founders didn't believe in dual citizenship. They outlawed it. They considered you a citizen of where you were born. Period. And what's worse? The Founders stripped you of US citizenship if you ever declared an oath to another nation--as Cruz's mother did when she took Canadian citizenship. In the 1950s, a Mexican-American was stripped of his US citizenship when he voted in a Mexican election and swore an oath to Mexico. Citizenship: Gone. [See: Perez v Brownell.] Same thing happened to a Jewish-American named Bays Afroyim in 1967 (with his country of controversy being not Mexico but Israel).

So if Cruz's mom really *did* swear allegiance to Canada and obtained citizenship there, the Founders would have been unambivalent: She would have been stripped of her US citizenship on the spot.

So Cruz couldn't have made the ""But my mom's an American"" argument to the Founders.

She wasn't *sent* to Canada by the US government. She didn't live in an embassy or a military base. She didn't ACCIDENTALLY have her kid there. She CHOSE to live in Canada.

This is what makes Cruz's case utterly different from someone like John McCain, who was born on US territory on a military base in Panama. So McCain can make a valid case that exceptions should be made for military brats, or the children of ambassadors. After all, embassies and military bases are, legally, US territory. It's not the official nation, but it *is* federal territory. And they can plead a second point: They had no choice in going.

Cruz's mother had a choice. She CHOSE to be Canadian.

Up until 1967, she would have been stripped of her citizenship for pledging allegiance to another country.

If you really believe that the Constitution should be applied *as written* and *as the Founders intended,* then no: Mr. Cruz does NOT meet the criteria. Not even close.

(But take heart, Mr. Cruz. You do meet the criteria to apply for *British* citizenship, given the fact that you were born in a Commonwealth country. At Republican conventions, you have a habit of wearing a red tie; but it's not the red tie that would have worried the Founding Fathers, it's the red *coat*.)",611

"As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton solely used her private email server for all official correspondence (source: [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/02/396823014/fact-check-hillary-clinton-those-emails-and-the-law)). Such an arrangement effectively shielded the emails from FOIA requests as they were stored on private property instead of State Department systems (source: [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/politics/using-private-email-hillary-clinton-thwarted-record-requests.html)). In addition, it prevented them from entering the official record until the State Department came back over a year after she left office and asked for them once they started responding to Benghazi inquiries and realized they had very few of her emails (source: [State Department quoted in WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-departments-account-of-e-mail-request-differs-from-clintons/2015/09/22/54cd66bc-5ed9-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html)). Clinton provided about 30000 work-related emails in response to the State Department's request and deleted another 30000 she and her lawyers deemed to not be work related (source: [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/12/brianna-keilar/when-did-hillary-clinton-delete-her-work-emails/)). However, her arrangement does not appear to have been illegal (source: [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/oct/16/democratic-debate-clinton-says-private-email-use-w/)).

Others have noted that former Secretary of State Colin Powell did something similar by also using an AOL account for some official emails (source: [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/08/charles-schumer/fact-checking-chuck-schumers-defense-hillary-clint/)). It is unknown to what extent Powell used this account; according to him, he only used it for ""mostly housekeeping stuff"" and used a secure State Department machine for sensitive material (source: [The Hill](http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/252863-colin-powell-i-used-two-computers-at-state)). Others have also drawn similarities to the Bush email scandal where he and his administration also used private email servers specifically to avoid creating a record of their communications (more info: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_email_controversy)).

The situation began to escalate when the State Department began releasing Clinton's emails as ordered by a judge in a FOIA lawsuit (source: [Vice News](https://news.vice.com/article/judge-orders-state-department-to-release-clinton-emails-on-rolling-basis)). Once they were publicly available, people started noticing in May 2015 that sections of her emails had been redacted due to containing classified information; however, it was quickly clarified that this information was not classified at the time it was sent and was only retroactively classified (source: [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/22/408774111/state-department-to-release-more-clinton-emails-today)).  

It escalated further in July 2015 when the State and Intelligence Community (IC) Inspectors General (IG) announced that they had discovered classified information in four emails (of 40 they reviewed) that was *not* retroactively classified, but classified at the time of generation (source: [ODNI](http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/210-press-releases-2015/1232-statement-from-the-inspectors-general-of-the-intelligence-community-and-the-department-of-state-regarding-the-review-of-former-secretary-clinton-s-emails)). As a result, the IC IG alerted the FBI by making a security (not a criminal) referral (source: same as previous). The FBI then started their own security (again, non-criminal) investigation into her email server and whether classified information was compromised (source: [NBC](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton/fbi-investigating-security-hillary-clinton-emails-n404341). The State Department (and Clinton campaign) responded by saying they disagreed with the classification decision and disputed whether the emails should be considered classified (source: [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/jul/29/four-pressing-questions-about-hillary-clintons-sta/)). The Clinton campaign also further clarified none of the emails had any classification markings (source: same as previous).

The IC IG then gave those emails to the CIA and other intelligence agencies, who confirmed that 2 emails should be classified Top Secret (source: [AP via Yahoo](http://news.yahoo.com/ap-exclusive-top-secret-clinton-emails-drone-talk-071308584--election.html)). Some unnamed intelligence officials disagreed, saying the emails merely discussed publicly available news articles about drone strikes; other unnamed intelligence officials agreed with the original assessment saying the discussion added classified information and confirmed the information from the articles; other unnamed officials noted she had not sent any of the emails but merely received them (source: same as previous).

The CIA and NGA conducted a second classification review of the emails and in Sep 2015 again came to the same conclusion: the emails were Top Secret (source: [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/us/politics/second-review-says-classified-information-was-in-hillary-clintons-email.html)). The State Department again disagreed, saying the emails should not be considered classified (source: same as previous).

The situation entered the news again last Tuesday, Jan 19 2015, when a letter from the IC IG to Congress was leaked to Fox News, saying that he had received sworn declarations from two unnamed IC elements that now covered ""several dozen"" emails from her server that should be considered classified at a variety of levels, including Top Secret / [SAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_access_program) (source: [NBC](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hillary-clinton-emails-contained-info-above-top-secret-ig-n499886)).  Shortly thereafter, Politico had an unnamed source saying that some or all of the emails were still about news articles about drones (source: [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/hillary-clinton-email-server-top-secret-217985)); Fox News also had unnamed sources saying that the each of the several dozen emails represented a separate correspondence thread and some included information on human intelligence sources (source: [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/23/exclusive-clinton-email-exposed-intel-from-human-spying.html)). The Clinton campaign responded to the newest allegations by claiming the IC IG had fabricated the charges and had coordinated the leak to help Republicans smear Hillary with others pointing out he had donated $1000 to Bush's campaign; an RNC spokesman pointed out the IC IG was an independent watchdog nominated by Obama and confirmed by the then-Democrat controlled Senate (source: [The Hill](http://www.thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/266437-clinton-spox-inspector-general-colluding-with-republicans)).

"The argument is that Hillary is seen as almost universally unfavorable by all Republicans and majority of Independents with **no** room to grow positively.

Is that so? Maybe these quotes by the founding fathers were forged then:


--Thomas Paine
&gt; “As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of government to protect all conscientious protesters thereof, and I know of no other business government has to do therewith. ” ~~ Common Sense, 1776.


--Thomas Jefferson
&gt; “… I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‘make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
&gt; exercise thereof,’ thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.” ~~ Letter to the Danbury Baptists, January 1, 1802

&gt; 
&gt; “[E]very one must act according to the dictates of his own reason, and mine tells me that civil powers alone have been given to the President of the U.S. and no authority to direct the religious exercises of his constituents.” ~~ Letter to Rev. Samuel Miller, January 23, 1808

--John Adams
&gt; “The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian Religion.” 1797, The Treaty of Tripoli, initiated by President Washington, signed by President John Adams, and approved by the Senate of the United States

--George Washington
&gt; “We have abundant reason to rejoice, that, in this land, the light of truth and reason has triumphed over the power of bigotry and superstition, and that every person may here worship God according to the dictates of his own heart. In this enlightened age, &amp; in this land of equal liberty, it is our boast, that a man’s religious tenets will not forfeit the protection of the laws, nor deprive him of the right of attaining &amp; holding the highest offices that are known in the United States.” ~~ Letter to the members of The New Church in Baltimore, January 1793


&gt; “If I could conceive that the general government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure, I beg you will be persuaded, that **no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny**, and every species of religious persecution.”
&gt; ~~ Letter to the United Baptist Chamber of Virginia, May 1789

--Benjamin Franklin
&gt; “When a religion is good, I conceive it will support itself; and when it does not support itself so that its professors are obliged to call for the help of the civil power, ’tis a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one.”

--James Madison
&gt; “[T]he number, the industry, and the morality of the Priesthood, &amp; the devotion of the people have been manifestly increased by the total separation of the Church from the State.” ~~ -Letter to Robert Walsh, March 2, 1819

--Alexander Hamilton
&gt; “[I]n politics as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.”
&gt; **“The [president] has no particle of spiritual jurisdiction**. . . .”

This is only a *sample*. The founding of this country is 100% secular, and there is really no debate to be had otherwise.

"I know this is going to be an unpopular comment, but the context for Clinton's 2005 senate speech matters. In this speech, she was actually speaking against a proposed federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage. Hillary Clinton's position at the time was against a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and in favor of civil unions which would grant same-sex partners the same rights under the law as traditionally married couples. At the time, this was seen as a pragmatic and, yes, *progressive* stance on the issue - at least in the context of united states federal politics. (In 2013, Clinton revised her stance on the issue and is now in favor of same-sex marriage.)

BTW, I completely respect anybody who believes that Clinton's position on this issue was not ""good enough"" back in the early 2000s.

&gt;President Barack Obama announced two years ago he would curtail eavesdropping on friendly heads of state after the world learned the reach of long-secret U.S. surveillance programs.

&gt;But behind the scenes, the White House decided to keep certain allies under close watch, current and former U.S. officials said. Topping the list was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

&gt;The U.S., pursuing a nuclear arms agreement with Iran at the time, captured communications between Mr. Netanyahu and his aides that inflamed mistrust between the two countries and planted a political minefield at home when Mr. Netanyahu later took his campaign against the deal to Capitol Hill.

&gt;The National Security Agency’s targeting of Israeli leaders and officials also swept up the contents of some of their private conversations with U.S. lawmakers and American-Jewish groups. That raised fears—an “Oh-s— moment,” one senior U.S. official said—that the executive branch would be accused of spying on Congress.
&gt;White House officials believed the intercepted information could be valuable to counter Mr. Netanyahu’s campaign. They also recognized that asking for it was politically risky. So, wary of a paper trail stemming from a request, the White House let the NSA decide what to share and what to withhold, officials said. “We didn’t say, ‘Do it,’ ” a senior U.S. official said. “We didn’t say, ‘Don’t do it.’ ”


&gt;Stepped-up NSA eavesdropping revealed to the White House how Mr. Netanyahu and his advisers had leaked details of the U.S.-Iran negotiations—learned through Israeli spying operations—to undermine the talks; coordinated talking points with Jewish-American groups against the deal; and asked undecided lawmakers what it would take to win their votes, according to current and former officials familiar with the intercepts.

The rest of the article just goes in-depth on American spying on Israel and other political leaders, and gives the NSA's take on things, as well as the White House's. It was a major article that this article is using to put it's own spin.",329

"From another redditor...

When Bill Clinton was president, he allowed Hillary to assume
Authority over a health care reform.

Even after threats and intimidation, she couldn't even get a vote in a Democratic controlled congress.

This fiasco cost the American taxpayers about $13 million in cost for studies, promotion, and other efforts.

Then President Clinton gave Hillary authority over selecting a female attorney general.

Her first two selections were Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood - both were forced to withdraw their names from consideration.

Next she chose Janet Reno - husband Bill described her selection as ""my worst mistake.""

Some may not remember that Reno made the decision to gas David Koresh and the Branch Davidian religious sect in Waco, Texas resulting in dozens of deaths of women and children.

Husband Bill allowed Hillary to make recommendations for the
Head of the Civil Rights Commission. Lani Guanier was her selection. When a little probing led to the discovery of Ms. Guanier's radical views,
Her name had to be withdrawn from consideration.

Apparently a slow learner, husband Bill allowed Hillary to make some more recommendations.

She chose former law partners Web Hubbel for the Justice Department, Vince Foster for the White House staff, and William Kennedy for the Treasury Department.

Her selections went well: Hubbel went to prison, Foster (presumably) committed suicide, and Kennedy was forced to resign.

Many younger votes will have no knowledge of ""Travelgate."" Hillary wanted to award unfettered travel contracts to Clinton friend Harry Thompson - and the White House Travel Office refused to comply.

She managed to have them reported to the FBI and fired.

This ruined their reputations, cost them their jobs, and caused a
Thirty-six month investigation.

Only one employee, Billy Dale was charged with a crime, and that of the enormous crime of mixing personal and White House funds.

A jury acquitted him of any crime in less than two hours.

Still not convinced of her ineptness, Hillary was allowed to recommend a close Clinton friend, Craig Livingstone, for the position of Director of White House security.

When Livingstone was investigated for the improper access of about 900 FBI files of Clinton enemies (Filegate) and the widespread use of drugs by White House staff, suddenly Hillary and the president denied even knowing Livingstone, and of course, denied knowledge of drug use in the White House.

Following this debacle, the FBI closed its White House Liaison Office after more than thirty years of service to seven presidents.

Next, when women started coming forward with allegations of sexual harassment and rape by Bill Clinton, Hillary was put in charge of the ""bimbo eruption"" and scandal defense.

Some of her more notable decisions in the debacle was:

She urged her husband not to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit.

After the Starr investigation they settled with Ms. Jones.

She refused to release the Whitewater documents, which led to the appointment of Ken Starr as Special Prosecutor.

After $80 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent, Starr's
Investigation led to Monica Lewinsky, which led to Bill lying about
And later admitting his affairs.

Hillary's devious game plan resulted in Bill losing his license to
Practice law for 'lying under oath' to a grand jury and then his
Subsequent impeachment by the House of Representatives.

Hillary avoided indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice
During the Starr investigation by repeating, ""I do not recall,"" ""I
Have no recollection,"" and ""I don't know"" a total of 56 times while
Under oath.

After leaving the White House, Hillary was forced to return an
Estimated $200,000 in White House furniture, China, and artwork that she had stolen.

What a swell party - ready for another four or eight year of this type low-life mess?

"So again a lot of people who defend Wall Street don't understand that Wall Street itself has been brutally honest about its own position in the system. In the leaked CitiGroup memos, the equity analysts had this to say in 2005 - 3 years before the collapse:

&gt; We will posit that: 1) the world is dividing into two blocs - the plutonomies, where economic growth is powered by and largely consumed by the wealthy few, and the rest. Plutonomies have occurred before in sixteenth century Spain, in seventeenth century Holland, the Gilded Age and the Roaring Twenties in the U.S. What are the common drivers of Plutonomy? Disruptive technology-driven productivity gains, creative financial innovation, **capitalist-friendly cooperative governments,** an international dimension of immigrants and overseas conquests invigorating wealth creation, the rule of law, and patenting inventions. Often these wealth waves involve great complexity, exploited best by the rich and educated of the time.
&gt;
&gt; 2) We project that the plutonomies (the U.S., UK, and Canada) will likely see even more income inequality, disproportionately feeding off a further rise in the profit share in their economies, capitalist-friendly governments, more technology-driven productivity, and globalization.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Most “Global Imbalances” (high current account deficits and low savings rates, high consumer debt levels in the Anglo-Saxon world, etc) that continue to (unprofitably) pre-occupy the world’s intelligentsia look a lot less threatening when examined through the prism of plutonomy. The risk premium on equities that might derive from the dyspeptic “global imbalance” school is unwarranted - the earth is not going to be shaken off its axis, and sucked into the cosmos by these “imbalances”. The earth is being held up by the muscular arms of its entrepreneur-plutocrats, like it, or not.
&gt;
&gt; - http://delong.typepad.com/plutonomy-1.pdf

I am a capitalist and I have always been a capitalist, but the trouble with this line of thought is that it ignores the fundamental reason why the US is the most innovative economy in the world: a large consumer base. It sets that aside and says that plutocrats will now drive consumption, but if you pause and think about it - do you honestly think that each plutocrat will buy 1,000 cars in a decade? Eat 3,000 meals a day? Or in general out-consume 1,000 middle class folks?

Henry Ford for all his faults understood this, which is why he championed such a high wage for his workers: he wanted people to be able to afford the Model T. If this bullshit continues, then in the quest for maximising their short-term profits these guys will fuck us over in the long-term. They will ruin the greatest part of the American system. They threaten the very existence of our consumer market.

From my perspective, Bernie's policies will lead to more wealth over the long-term, because when people aren't terrified of losing their homes or going under due to medical bills - they're more willing to buy a new iPhone, one of the apps I like to fund, or something else...

Bernie on the other hand... He's a different breed altogether. If you accuse him of being a wild-eyed liberal, he'll embrace it and turn it around on you. You'll have to get into a debate on how or why this proposal or that proposal would not work or would have unintended consequences and I think that's where a lot of debate viewers' eyes will glaze over.

I don't think that the HRC should ever have to base their endorsement on ""who supported LGBT rights first"". This isn't some hipster fashion statement. There are many other factors involved in this. The simple fact that Clinton is far more well known and visible than Sanders may have been a huge part of this endorsement choice. 

There is more at stake in this choice than who will be the next President of the USA. The HRC does a shit-ton more than endorse Presidential Candidates. Perhaps they felt that an endorsement with Clinton would be more in line with their long-term goals and visibility.

tl;dr Smearing the HRC's endorsement of Clinton is petty and short-sighted. We should encourage people to change their minds on LGBT rights issues.

"This is the most Tennessee thing I can imagine. I'm originally from Putnam County, one of the aforementioned counties in the article. The Putnam County THP and Cookeville City PD were responsible for one of the very early excessive use of force incidents to receive national attention, way back in 2003. [In this video](https://youtu.be/B_9yISBRSl0) THP officers pulled over a family, and assumed they had committed a robbery after someone reported seeing money flying out of the vehicle as it got on the interstate. The money turned out to be from the driver's wallet which he had accidentally left on top of the car. Of course, the logical thing to do when you receive an unsubstantiated report like that is to pull the family out of their car at gunpoint, shoot their dog when it jumps out of the car, and slam the driver to the pavement. The incident is [further detailed here.](http://mobile.wnd.com/2003/01/16635/#JcG1yLpOkXcF9wpi.99) This is just one example of how the police agencies in this area couldn't be a more incompetent group of assholes. So of course they would be imbued with what seems like non-constitutional powers to detain and search people. That's just how things are here in Tennessee.

Edit: People are getting hung up on my final sentence: ""That's just how things are here in Tennessee."" That is not in reference to the excessive force incident, it is in reference to the STATEWIDE law that is being used to force a bloodtest if it is suspected that you are under the influence. We see similarly  constitutionally hazy state laws in Tennessee regarding asset forfeiture, and Tennessee is among the states most aggressively profiting from asset forfeitures.

As for ""undeniably hard working and intelligent"": Uh Yeah, the guy was a high school valedictorian, has a bachelors from Princeton and a Law degree from Harvard (they just don't give those out to anyone). On top of that it is generally known that the guy is the one of the best lawyers in the country. Undeniably hard working and intelligent. You must acknowledge greatness where it is due whether you like the person or not.

Really the source of my frustration is the fact that I can't get a straight answer from people who supposedly represent me. And the truth is Ted Cruz isn't the problem. He was elected by Americans. The problem is lack of education of the general public. And that ownness could lie in the hands of media outlets or our schools or even our own families. But the salient point is that there is a fundamental problem with the education of the general public. And if we don't address it then there will be more Ted Cruzes closer and closer to the White House.

"This is incorrect - in the US banks measure size with GAAP accounting, while other countries (all that I'm aware of) use IFRS which counts off balance sheet exposures. Here's a corrected list of largest banks using corrected accounting standards: http://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2014/02/12/worlds-100-biggest-banks-chinas-icbc-1-no-u-s-banks-in-top-5/

6 bank holding companies in the US control about 70% of US financial assets, a level of concentration higher than that of other countries (and that's lowballing based on GAAP and not IFRS).

Furthermore, Canada's regulatory structure is completely different from the US which has different regulators for different types of banks (OCC, FDIC, Fed and State Regulators) vs market activities (CFTC, SEC) vs specific consumer issues (CFPB) and no federal regulation of the insurance business. Canada's regulatory model is far more concentrated and forces banks to act much more conservatively, but also limits the types of organizations that can be competitive. In other words, it would be easier to break up the banks in the US than to adopt Canada's regulatory structure. 

Your leverage point is all well and good, but I should point out the obvious - a highly leveraged small bank is less a threat than a highly leveraged large bank. It's also why using IFRS instead of GAAP accounting, and setting strong leverage ratios are important goals of financial regulation. Achieving those goals would be easier if so much political power wasn't concentrated in a small number of banks - another very important reason to support a break-up.",117

"It's important to note the original question as well:

&gt;Q: Do you notice a difference between young women and women our age in their excitement about Hillary Clinton? Is there a generational divide? 

&gt;DWS: Here’s what I see: a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided.

Wasserman Schultz is *supposed* to be the impartial chair of the DNC.  When asked about a generational divide in the female support of *one* of the Democratic candidates, she chooses to patronize those non-supporters.  I have two problems with this response. 

1. This is horrible strategy for the general election.  Ostracizing your constituents and calling them complacent for not supporting *one* of the Democratic candidates is no way to court more votes. More ammunition for the other side. 

2.  This reveals just how partial she is towards Hillary Clinton.  To insult these young female voters for not supporting *one* of the candidates available clearly reveals that she is partial to that candidate.  Bernie Sanders has plenty of young female support. She is in HRC's pocket.

Edit: Let's be clear; ~~her answer is quite simply a deflection.  Voter complacency as a reason for lack of support excitement for a candidate? What the hell is she even talking about? Quite a disgusting [interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/debbie-wasserman-schultz-thinks-young-women-are-complacent.html) in my opinion.~~ 

as /u/herhehejhrekjashsd phrased much better than I, ""She essentially told them that if the young people don't support HRC they are out of touch with the people that supported abortion rights leading up to Roe vs Wade. Which is so grossly false I don't know what to say beyond that.""",184

The Clinton endorsement was done by their editorial board, as are all their endorsements. The NYT has reported on tons of negative Clinton stories, and in fact partnered with the conservative author of Clinton Cash to print news stories about the Clinton Foundation and is the news source that led the way with those stories.

Just because the NYT endorses Clinton, that doesn't mean there are not journalists with the paper that just report on news. And that doesn't create some ""hypocrisy"" that you are desperately reaching for by trying to dig up some basic news article on Mitt Romney from 2012.

I have no doubt that if Sanders was in her situation she would say something along the lines of:

Sanders should quit the race, so the Democratic party has a chance of winning the general election. He is harming the Democratic party and he should think about the greater good for the party and not about his personal ambition.""

So this argument really hold no water for anything the democrats are proposing. We're just arguing about ideals here.

2) Obama didn't ""burn all his political capital"", 2014 happened. After 2014 the congress drastically changed which is why he was no longer able to accomplish much of anything outside of executive orders.

3) And here's the real answer. Bernie has said all along that none of this will be able to pass with this congress. The movement building behind his campaign needs to keep going strong after he's elected. We need tog et more progressives into office, and drastically change the political landscape of congress. That's the only way we'll get any positive change done.

"That is an understatement. It's becoming more and more clear that Hillary is unable to effectively deal with Bernie's relatively civilized criticisms of her. She has just provided her opponents with too much ammo. She plays politics like it's still the 1990s and we're living in a brave new internet fueled world where people can find out how full of shit a politician is with a few clicks of a mouse.

Just a guess: If she beats Bernie in the primary, Trump will slaughter her. The GOP establishment is starting to warm up to Donald and accept that he is going to be their guy. Billions and billions of dollars are going to be poured into finding any and every crack in Hillary's armor and tearing those holes wide open. You thought the GOP had it in for Obama? You ain't seen nothin' yet. 

Trump is just the guy for the job too. He doesn't give a rats ass about looking like a hypocrite or shitting all over political correctness. Fuck, *he's running on it*. You'd better believe he is going to charge headfirst in to anything the GOP machine can scare up on Hillary. He's going to be doing stuff like paying off attendees at her speaking gigs to breach their NDAs and go on record with the things she said at those speeches. And each and every thing he brings up is going to go viral. His media presence is a force of nature.

It's funny. The DNC primaries have gone full circle. At first, the main rationale for compromising on progressiveness was that Hillary was the electable one. Now it's starting to look like Bernie is the only shot we have left. ",1985

Since you likely just read the headline.

Edit: my comment implies that he didn't say the quoted text. He does. What I meant was that his ad didn't specifically call out Clnton, but all establishment candidates who take money from wallstreet. However, in the interview after establishing it wasn't a direct attack on Clinton he pointed out that it was an important distinction between the two of them. The actual interview is much different than the tone of the headline, but he does technically point out that Hillary takes a lot of money from wall street.

"Not True.

The governing statute is 8 USC 1401 (see the modern version here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401). The basis of this US Code was the McCarran-Walter act of 1952. There have been some revisions to the original language, but the relevant portions were the same in 1970 when Cruz was born as they were in 1961 when Obama was born. There were amendments made in 1966  (see here: http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=80&amp;page=1322), but they do not impact the relevant analysis.

Ted Cruz was born to in Canada, his mother being a US citizen and his father being Cuban. For the sake of argument, let's say that Barack Obama was born in Kenya (not true, but let's play along with the birthers) to a mother that was a US citizen and father that was a Kenyan. Both Cruz's parents and Obama's parents were married at the time of their respective child's birth.

Thus, you are partially correct that that the ""same logic"" applies, in that the same relevant code section applies to both situations. Namely, the 8 USC 1401(g) (Which is Sec. 301(a)(7) of the original act (see here: http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=66&amp;page=235#).

This code section states that the following people shall be considered a US citizen at birth:
""a person born outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United States who,**prior to the birth of such person**, was **physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years**..."" 

Note that a 1986 amendment to the law (here: http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=100&amp;page=3657) replaced ""ten years, at least five of which"" with ""five years, at least two of which."" But this was after both Cruz and Obama were born, so this change is not relevant.

So, the real birthright citizenship test comes down to where their mothers were in the period of time before their births.

I do not know enough about Cruz's mother's life to answer this question (she does not appear to have a wikipedia page). If someone really wanted to question Cruz's citizenship, they would have to investigate his mother's life.

What about the fictitious Obama that was born in Kenya? Well, his mother was born November 29, 1942 and Obama was born August 4, 1961. Meaning: Obama's mother was 18 when she gave birth to him. If she was 18, there is no possible way she spent ""at least five"" years in the US ""after attaining the age of fourteen"" prior to Obama's birth. Consequently, Kenyan Obama would not be a citizen at birth under this law.

TLDR: The same law applies to both, but you need to know a lot about their mothers history to make a ""citizen at birth"" determination.

PS - This is also all assuming that the statutory definition of ""citizen of the US at birth"" has the same scope and meaning as the US Constitution's ""natural-born citizen."" That may not be true, in which case all of the above does not really matter.

"I'm also a veteran and my current job brings me into close contact with the bureaucratic side of our mental health care system. I've had veteran Facebook friends perpetuating that same garbage line about Obama confiscating guns from vets who seek treatment for PTSD for years and I've done my best to dissuade them (because really, if that was a thing that was happening on a large scale the veterans lobby would be screaming from the rafters - anything that would lead vets in need to avoid treatment would be seriously disfavored)

After these latest actions by the administration, I'm not sure I can provide that reassurance any more. The president has directed SSA to make rules to restrict the gun rights of certain SS beneficiaries by including them in NICS. This is not necessarily tantamount to gun confiscation, but it leaves open the question of whether persons who SSA identifies as being ineligible to buy guns will thereby become ""prohibited persons"" for firearm possession under federal law based solely on a review of their medical records and diagnoses and for no other reason than they have applied to receive SS benefits. I will be watching to see how the rules are drafted, but it should bother anyone who claims to care about medical privacy rights, destigmatizing mental illness, and creating incentives to seek treatment that the government might restrict people's rights or expose them to serious criminal penalties in this fashion.

"Although I see where you're coming from, I disagree. It makes sense to me that the DNC would dislike Bernie. Simply speaking, he isn't one of them. Although Bernie caucused with the Democrats (generally speaking), he was until very recently an independent. 

Imagine it from the DNC's perspective - you've spent the last 8 years thinking about and planning of the 2016 race. You've looked among your members and picked the best ones. There's a lot of uncertainties but you're feeling pretty good with the way things are turning out.

Then bam - out of no where comes this Independent, firebrand progressive who says he's running for your parties nomination. He's never been a member of your party! He hasn't paid his dues! He hasn't shown fealty to the parties executive management! What has he ever done for you?! Who the hell does this guy think he is?!

Are you just going to let this guy walk into your primaries like he owns the place, ruining your years of careful calculations and planning? Hell no! As the party's leadership, you've got your own horse in this race that you want to win. You're going to stack the deck as much in your man/woman's favor; you're going to try and get away with as much as possible without making it blatantly obvious what you're doing.

I don't think it's a big, evil DNC conspiracy against Bernie - it's just politics.",147
"I'll go with a serious response, and from someone who is a Democrat and more or less agnostic on the candidates (by that I mean either candidate would be a better president than any of the Republican candidates):

My view is first and foremost that no charges have been made. Until they are, this is just click-bait reporting.

Second view is that you have multiple agencies disagreeing about what is or is not classified.

Third, and most importantly, is that since the beginning I have viewed this as an IT policy issue. Hillary did not setup her own IT server, she hired someone. To do so someone at State had to give access to a 3rd party to setup a system. To do that, they needed approval. Whether it was Hillary or a low level employee, their IT policy at the time allowed this (even though there are obvious reasons not to).

To put it another way, I used to work for a health insurance company that pulled in well north of $100M a year in revenue. Based on the policy data we had access to, we had VERY tight security standards, which included e-mail.

You could not access e-mail on a personal phone, it had to be owned by the company, 100%. If you tried to set it up on a non-authorized phone, it would not work. IT and the Chief Compliance Officer were in charge of this based on government guidelines.

Now, here's the important part: No one, not even the owner of the company, could circumvent this. If they did, they would be terminated.

Where I'm going with this is the same thing - someone at State in IT signed off on this. Someone in IT at State was aware of this during her tenure. They hold the keys, and could have easily refused to allow it. They did not. So now to turn around and blame the non-technical person and the 3rd party who were allowed to make this happen is, to me at least, disingenuous.

It was a stupid policy, but there are plenty of other stories about government e-mail being handled in very questionable matters. In all cases though, that's an IT policy concern.

Look at the reactions to gun legislation. No Obama isnt going to take them. And the majority of the shit doesnt even come from Obama. Gun interests groups fear monger all the fucking time. Why? Because dumbasses freak out and buy up the surplus ammo. Its all about earnings for the fiscal quarter.

"There's a difference between being a corrupt crony and an ambivalent moderate though; most politicians simply don't want to deal with financial reform because it is an incredibly arcane thicket.  Do you really think most of them or even most of the people here on reddit could craft another Dodd-Frank Act?

That should be an interesting case study of what comes close to working by the way.

* The politicians who were ""captive"" were the ones who understood what to fix and what to do surgically without dire financial consequences for the average American.  Chris Dodd who helped craft the Dodd-Frank Act went on to head the MPAA, for example.

* The *Volcker Rule* which successfully does bar a great deal of risky speculation was proposed by a former Fed chairman and pushed through by lobbying by community banks.

* The Act was not undone by massive lobbying or corruption but by the dogmatism of the Republican legislators most of whom had no direct link to bank lobbying but simply saw it as a platform by which to oppose an incumbent President.

* Clinton is a liar and not a reformer or populist but she's not a crony either.  Some have called her and her husband's style Third Way, being a moderate, or simply opportunistically shy but she's not running at the age of 68 because she thinks there will be great future dividends for being a shill.

This us vs. them reddit keyboard thumping is nice and all as was OWS' rhetoric about the 1% but there is no conspiracy or hivemind, just an incredibly complex web of people who have overlapping interests.  The Koch brothers, George Soros, Warren Buffet, Oprah, and Bill Gates have widely different interests and goals as does the financial sector; it's easy to blame certain firms but most of them have gone under - the 2008 recession required the cooperation of a dozen different types of firms to facilitate the growth of toxic assets beyond the usual busts we've seen since 1929.

He was a longlimbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn’t earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major’s father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap,” he counseled one and all, and everyone said, “Amen.”

&gt; Major Major’s father was an outspoken champion of economy in government, provided it did not interfere with the sacred duty of government to pay farmers as much as they could get for all the alfalfa they produced that no one else wanted or for not producing any alfalfa at all. He was a proud and independent man who was opposed to unemployment insurance and never hesitated to whine, whimper, wheedle and extort for as much as he could get from whomever he could.

Rather than one or three large entities responsible for handling all of the country's private and enterprise finances (a situation in which a bank going under means catastrophe for the entire country, leading to TBTF) you have a larger number of smaller banks resulting in a system that can tolerate localized failure.

Note that I'm not sure what the exact implications of a local banks failure actually are. I'd guess it would mean some other bank would pay to acquire their credits/debts, yielding a slightly larger bank.

&gt;That theory first emerged in the spring of 2008, as Clinton supporters circulated an anonymous email questioning Obama’s citizenship.

&gt;“Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy. She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth,” asserted one chain email that surfaced on the urban legend site Snopes.com in April 2008.",756

"&gt;Even worse for Clinton, the problem is that she has never articulated an uplifting and exciting reason for voters to back her, and her negative attack against Sanders will drown out any positive message she may have, if she has one.

This encapsulates Hillary's campaign. If Hillary didn't have the name recognition she has, she would have no chance. That is her only capital at the moment.",146
"&gt; ""It’s true that Clinton sat on the Wal-Mart board for six years while her husband was governor of Arkansas, where the chain has its corporate headquarters. She was paid about $18,000 a year for doing it. At the time, she worked at the Rose Law Firm, which had represented Wal-Mart in various matters.""

Might be a better source, but that one was easy to find.

&gt;  Billionaires Alice Walton, George Soros and Marc Benioff are helping to finance a super-political action committee encouraging former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run for president, according to a report filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission.

&gt; Each gave $25,000 to Ready for Hillary PAC, organized a year ago to provide Clinton outside support if she chooses to seek the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.

"I think one of the problems is that, on the federal level, we have seen absolutely no compromise, and no pushback in terms of gun control. We had the assault weapons ban, and that expired, but other that, we have seen a consistent encroachment of gun rights since about the 1930s.

It doesn't make sense to talk about compromise when what you're really saying is, ""I'll get some of what I want now, and the rest later."" If people were serious about opening up channels of dialogue and getting people to think, they'd offer something in exchange for something else. Say, national concealed carry in exchange for national licensing and background checks. Or re-opening the machinegun registry and ending its taxes in exchange for registering all guns or something.

Instead we have measures that will not change the crime rates in this country in any meaningful way, and the polarization gets worse every day. All I can say that I am glad for is that the states seem to be on the right track when it comes to concealed carry, and individual people seem to be more open minded about the issue.

EDIT:
&gt;Even hinting at an idea that strays from this rigid ideology will get you labeled anti-2nd Amendment and anti-American, effectively ending any actual reasoned discussion or debate.

You know, it's just as bad, but in the opposite direction, in left wing enclaves. I shocked quite a lot of people growing up by openly supporting gun rights and gay marriage at the same time. As far as I'm concerned, it's moral cowardice to pick and choose which freedoms you want to protect. I might have more of a stake in gun rights than the next guy, and he might have more of a stake in gay marriage than me, but it's like the old saying... ""First they came for the Socialists...""",201

"It is absolutely insane and straight up ignorant for anyone to say there has not been a media blackout for the Sanders campaign. Facts are facts and here is one statistical example/proof.


From Oct 2, 2015


&gt;Andrew Tyndall monitored broadcast news from ABC, NBC, and CBS and found that of the 504 minutes devoted thus far to the presidential race, 145 minutes had been dedicated to talking about “The Donald”, that’s around 30 percent and there were 165 minutes allotted to Hillary Clinton, with about half of that total talking about her email problems.

&gt;But what about Bernie? How much time is he really getting. We’ve all been complaining loudly that the networks have all but shunned him. Is it as bad as we think it is? Well he’s gotten a paltry 8 minutes on network news. That’s less than 2 percent and this for the guy that is leading in Iowa and New Hampshire and although I heavily question the methodology of the “national” polls, is doing well there too. The networks have devoted about that much time to Chis Christie, who most agree has no shot. They’ve also handed Jeb Bush, despite his low polling numbers, somewhere around 43 minutes of airtime, which is 5 times what Bernie has gotten.",182
"People make this argument, but it's not like losing the White House and having the national party in complete shambles is *good* for down ticket elections.  Gerrymandering is starting to get sniped by the courts.  A dem in the White House is going to keep control of the Supreme Court as well. 

Not to mention that the republican voter base is literally dying.  These tent pole issues (anti-gay marriage/anti-abortion/etc.) don't work one generation down, but a lot of the younger republican politicians are building their careers on those issues to sway current conservative voters.  The establishment still holds the power of money, but if it can't decide which way its going, that money is useless or factioned resulting in something rather similar to what you see in the primaries right now.

Yes, it's not a total loss for the GOP for the moment, but things are getting worse for their position, not better.",102

What about the same earth scientists that predict global warming? (We complain that Republicans don't listen to the science, or want to ignore it..) Earth scientists can also model the Geomechanics and Fracture mechanics in the subsurface! If your target is 5000 ft, and the deepest water table extends only to 1500 ft in that area, with no faults (or other communicative pathways) available, you can PROVE that there is very little risk at the site.

For those who don't know, the military, and nuclear sites also use similar techniques for wastewater injection. In the US there are over 150k wastewater injection sites active today which are permanent installations. But temporary hydraulic fracturing operations get a bad rap due to association with the oil industry.

"The support I'm seeing in the comments here at /r/politics is really a testament to how effective a move this is.

1. Trump knows he has the primary, at least Iowa, wrapped up after destroying Cruz in the previous debate. (Trump has a habit of destroying whoever is number two in the polls.)
2. So the only thing he can do in THIS debate is lose. Might as well not even go. Sometimes, the strongest play is not to sit at the table.
3. He's polling #1 in Iowa, and all of this attention only makes him stronger. He's going to win Iowa.
4. IMO, he wins N.H. and S.C. too and wraps it up earlier than people think. Just an opinion though. Prediction:  Republicans will rally around him like crazy once they realize that they have no other choice and that they've finally found a winner. Republicans aren't splitting their votes this year.
5. He's already turning to the general election and earning the love of Democrats because he's the enemy of their enemy, Fox News.

The fact that you see people in the comments rationalizing (maybe rightly) ""Trump is more liberal than he seems"" and calling him a political genius shows just how effectively timed this move is. A few months ago, Trump was a racist clown...now comments in /r/politics are talking about how he went to an Ivy League school and how he's just putting on a character to win the primaries. 

I mean, I kind of agree, but that's *amazing.* That's a complete turnaround in his image from people he wants to vote for him in the general election. That's really hard to do. The only one who gets as much love on Reddit now is Rand Paul, and he's not going to win anything. Apparently behind the scenes, Roger Ailes is desperate to get him back on, but now Trump will only talk to **MURDOCH.** lol. He owns Fox now, and he'll use them to win Democrat votes.

Instead he chooses to make them lose a bunch of money, while propping up his noble cause of helping raise money for veterans. He comes out as the good guy. A crazy amount of effective manipulation. 

2. Trump is at the top and has everything to lose, he already has solidified his base and the debate would be high-risk and marginal reward. He knows which battles to pick. 

3. Trump not showing up for the debate completely undercuts any other candidate from getting their final last push to a large audience. Their message will be heard by millions fewer than previous debates, something most cannot afford to have happen. Trump is winning and wants that debate to be as boring as possible, which he will get.

Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.

"She's not wrong. Say what you want about DWS, but the truth is that voter turnout is generally horrendous, especially with democrats and millennials in mid-elections. 

Bernie Sanders alluded to this problem in the first debate, when he essentially asked how he would 'compromise with a republican congress and get his platform/initiatives passed'. He didn't give a bullshit response, he flatly stated that getting him in the White House ins't enough if there is entrenched political opposition that blocks/obstructs/opposes everything put forth--and the only solution is for people to go to the polls and change the makeup of congress. Until people realize this, nothing will change. 

The GOP is gradually shifting strategy and placing more focus on local and state elections, and its working. Bernie may be the next President, but his hands will be indefinitely tied thanks to a rabidly partisan and uncompromising congress. In the meantime your state legislature &amp; governor will turn further right, and work to systematically undue whatever policy/platform that you believe in. 

edit: All the responses blaming DWS for a low turnout or dem complacency are bullshit. I've been voting since 2004 and the whomever was the DNC Chair during these elections had ZERO impact on whether or not *I* personally decided to show up to the poll and vote. My vote was always cast based on overall policy platform, not on whoever the DNC Chair was. There are a lot of bad things that can be said about DWS, but blaming her for low turnout and continual loss of dem seats is not one of them. This problem is entirely the fault of the voter, who through sheer laziness chooses not to vote or participate in the process. DWS hasn't been concealing voter registration information, dates of elections, polling locations/times nationwide, etc. People are simply lazy and don't give a shit purely by their own accord. ",195

""Major Major’s father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age. He was a longlimbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn’t earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major’s father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap,” he counseled one and all, and everyone said, “Amen.”

Major Major’s father was an outspoken champion of economy in government, provided it did not interfere with the sacred duty of government to pay farmers as much as they could get for all the alfalfa they produced that no one else wanted or for not producing any alfalfa at all. He was a proud and independent man who was opposed to unemployment insurance and never hesitated to whine, whimper, wheedle and extort for as much as he could get from whomever he could.""

Sanders voted against DOMA because he thought it infringed on states rights, he refused to take a stance on hay marriage when Vermont passed civil unions in 2000 and when neighboring Massachusetts passed gay marriage in 2004, he opposed gay marriage in Vermont in 2006 because he thought it was too divisive, and he first supported gay marriage in 2009--right after 90% of elected Democrats in Vermont had voted to override the governor's veto to enact gay marriage.**([source](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/us/politics/as-gay-rights-ally-bernie-sanders-wasnt-always-in-vanguard.html?_r=0)).  

They're both recent converts to gay marriage--as are most Democrats.  And, like most Democrats, they refused to support gay marriage until it became politically safe for them to do so.  

Likewise, Clinton and Sanders both supported civil unions in 2000 prior to their gay marriage evolutions. Sanders famously defended gay troops in the House in 1995--three years after Bill and Hillary Clinton campaigned on gays being able to openly serve despite that position being opposed by a majority of the country.  

As to why they endorsed Clinton over Sanders. . . generally being on the right side of issues is great, but being a friend to and an advocate for a community means more than just voting the right way. It means outreach and prioritization and building relationships. Sanders is now learning this lesson with black and Hispanic voters, as well as with the LGBT community.  

** Please don't tell me that Sanders was justified in opposing gay marriage in Vermont because the ""bruising"" battle over civil unions.  First, since when does Sanders believe we shouldn't fight for something because it would be too divisive? Thinking big and standing up to entrenched interests is his what his entire campaign is based on. It's an especially hilarious talking point given that Sanders is pushing a big fight on single payer while the country is still bitterly divided over Obamacare.  Second, it's complete bullshit that Vermont was too divided on civil unions in 2006 to start a fight for gay marriage. Neighboring Massachusetts had already started gay marriage, and the [2004 exit polls](http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/VT/P/00/epolls.0.html) showed that 77% of Vermont voters supported civil unions and/or gay marriage. Whatever bitter divide existed back when Vermont passed civil unions back in 2000 had completely disappeared when Sanders refused to support gay marriage in Vermont in 2006.",129

The idea of ""burning it down"" makes me wonder if anyone who says it was old enough to remember bush. That was a complete disaster and didn't come close to burning anything down. A shitty ridiculous president isn't going to turn the country or world to such chaos that everything will fall and we'll build again from the rubble, it'll just fuck the economy, setting back a bunch of working people, perhaps undo so some social progress, setting back some religious or racial minorities, and maybe lead to ill advised military engagements, wasting a ton of money and lives. It won't be the hard reset people think, anyone old enough to remember bush should know this.

As for sending some message to the DNC, they don't and won't give a shit. The people behind the curtain will be fine in their ivory towers so to speak. They'll say aw shucks and try the same shit again next time. Sticking it to them is supporting Bernie now and trying to help him beat Hillary. Look at the RNC, loss after loss and they tried, and would have, run Jeb Bush, if Trump hadn't shown up and blown it for them (and I don't mean that as a endorsement of trump in any way) - same old shit as far as they're concerned. The people at the top of these things won't learn lessons because they have zero skin in the game. If Hillary wins she'll be endorsed by Obama and by Bernie who will plead with their supporters to prevent a republican president for good reason. Trust them then like you trust them now. Trump won't burn shit down or lead to some DNC rebirth. He'll just be another shitty president that sets us back. ",408

"&gt; Yeah maybe but some Norwegian is enjoying their life twice as much as we are, worries about shit less, doesn't work as hard, is way healthier, etc. They dismissed me easily, scoffing. Thats holding you guys down, imho. Because even if you're the ""best"" you can always do better.

I like your point, but I'd like to counterargument. It may be a nice thing to debate.

First of all, can I replace Norway with any other nordic country? Norway is pretty much a little-populated country which has been blessed with huge amounts of oil. They managed it very well (this is rare when you talk about state-ran oil, trust me! It almost always [ends up in tears](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/business/international/effects-of-petrobras-scandal-leave-brazilians-lamenting-a-lost-dream.html)). It helped them a lot to fund their current status as a highly-developed nation. Being so oil-reliant also means that some of the economic data is not so good to show real standard of living (Qatar is a poor nation, yet it has the highest GDP per capita of the world).

Let's take Sweden as our example.

- Enjoying life twice as much as we are: [Americans work 1,790 hours an year, while Swedes work 1,621 hours an year](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LEVEL). It sure is more, but only 10% more.

- Worries about shit less: You're talking about unemployment safety net, Swedes sure have a better time than American when it comes to this.

- Doesn't work as hard: I've already talked about hours of work per year, but there's another factor: labor productivity. Americans may work a lot, but their work is really productive. $64 of GDP/hr worked, actually. Sweden's rate is 85% of that, at $55 (data from the OECD link from earlier). So, yes, Americans work extremely hard, but that's mostly why the USA have the biggest economic might in the world.

- Are way healthier: I completely agree that the US healthcare system is fucked. I really don't know what's the optimal thing to do with it (I'm not completely informed about this debate, but I'm sure we should be looking more to Germany than to the Nordic countries. It bears far more resemblance to the US demographic situation).

However, there's another factor we don't count on: what's the role of the US's positive externalities on the success of the Nordics? I argue that it's huge. They can rely on US military for defense (and enjoy extremely safe sea trade pretty much because of the worldwide presence of the US Navy). They have access to the innovations enabled by the US's public and private sectors - how healthy would Sweden be without the American pharmaceutical industry? A lot less, of course. There's actually lots of people arguing that medicines are only cheap in Europe, as well as most developing nations *because* Americans pay more.

That's my whole point: you can't argue that those countries are heavens on Earth. They're in some aspects worse than the US and in a lot of aspects free ride on the positive sides of the American might. A part of their success is *due* to the United States (as well as many other countries, obviously).

That may be why I like Switzerland so much. It can have a far stronger private sector, a nice (but not overly bloated) social safety net, keep civil liberties way up and don't need to do this in a way that makes the government define the country and the people. What's the first thing you think about Norway? It's government. With Switzerland, it's its many industries (banking, clockwork, chocolate...). That may be why Nordic countries struggle with high suicide rates, but that's an extremely speculative statement I'm almost embarrassed of making. Frankly, I'd choose living in Switzerland over living in Germany over living in Sweden/Norway. But that's just me.",141

I have always fallen in line and voted for the Democratic nominee in the past, but things I have learned the past year have convinced me that to continue to do so would be contributing, albeit somewhat benignly, to the corruption of our political system.

I find it somewhat sad when Hillary defenders say things like ""there is no proof that the reason she changed on the bankruptcy law had anything to do with getting huge speaking fees and campaign contributions from Wall Street.""

Then it turned into DWS saying that it would be impossible to schedule any more debates because it was hard enough scheduling the original debates on those abysmal dates.

Now all of the sudden Hillary starts doing worse in the polls and Sander's starts to trend upwards. Out of the blue with no notice the Iowa Forum was scheduled, when it was said time and time again that it was impossible to do.

Then an unsanctioned debate from MSNBC came up and both Hillary and O'Malley said they were game as long as the DNC got rid of the exclusion rule and everyone agreed to it. Sander's said no, but would happy to do it if they got rid of the exclusion rule (I guess he was afraid they'd try to use it against him if he participated).

The point is you have to look at everything in it's context. All of the sudden after months of calling for more debates and being told no, it's impossible, Hillary starts doing worse and the seemingly impossible debates start popping out of nowhere.

* A 3 cents per kilowatt saving over my unit price from BGE
* a mandatory 20-year agreement with them that I cannot get out from
* they'll take all the federal tax credits for the solar panels
* mandatory broadband internet access that I must provide at my cost so their panels can communicate with their monitoring stations
* a minimum of $500 labor fee if I ever have to move the panels to repair my roof
* a ""not a lien"" hold on my house wherein they are involved as a 3rd party if I ever want to sell my house

I do all of that just to get a fucking 3 cents per kilowatt over BGE? Think about that. BGE is able to operate a generating station miles from me, run &amp; maintain power lines to get the power to my house, do not have to use any of my resources (internet, roof)....BGE is able to do all of that and SolarCity can only save me 3 cents. So either somebody is getting rich or SolarCity is horribly inefficient. 

When the SolarCity repcame, I was really excited to switch to solar. I had visions of running my house on solar and getting a solar powered car. But the more I heard about the **business model** these guys have come up with, the more disappointed I got. Especially with the 20-year lock in agreement. Solar companies are able to make inroads in the utility market because existing power companies don't do that kind of shit. We went through that crap with cell phones already. Which makes me wonder, if you have solar with one of these companies, what made you switch?",130

#Marginal Tax Rate Changes

###GRAPH: http://i.imgur.com/pYnUXcQ.png

* The graph takes a look at four different data sets. To make things easier I made the 230k-411k bracket actually start at 250k. The first is the current marginal tax rate. The next is the increase based off of Sanders’ proposals and the assumption that the Medicare tax on households is a change from the current 1.45% to 2.2%. The next is based off of the assumption that the Medicare tax on households is a new tax, so it increases taxes by 2.2%. The final one is based off of fears that employers will offset the tax put on them onto employees since it is documented that it happens, and it is also based off of the 2.2% increase. This is considered the worst case scenario.

Current marginal tax rates for individuals:

* 0 - $9,225 = 10%
* $9,226 - 37,450 = 15%
* $37,451 - 90,750 = 25%
* $90,751 - 189,300 = 28%
* $189,301 - 411,500 = 33%
* $411,501 - 413,200 = 35%
* $413,201+ = 39.6%

And for families:

* 0 - $18,450 = 10%
* $18,451 - 79,900 = 15%
* $79,901 - 151,200 = 25%
* $151,201 - 230,450 = 28%
* $230,451 - 411,500 = 33%
* $411,501 - 464,850 = 35%
* $464,851+ = 39.6%

**Here are the increases:**

*NOTE: While Sanders proposes a 6.2% tax on employers, it is well documented that this tax can be put onto employees. I will not add them into the total, but please keep this in mind to get a better picture.*

* Under $28,800 = +0%
* $28,801 - 249,999 = +0.75%
* $250,000 - 500,000 = hard to calculate because of current marginal tax rates, but it'll be ~+4.75%
* $500,000 - 2,000,000 = +4.15% 
* $2,000,000 - 10,000,000 = +9.15%
* $10,000,000+ = +13.15%

*Note: these take into account the new income tax + the rise from 1.45% to 2.2% for Medicare tax. However, Bernie's plan could be increasing the tax by +2.2% but I would hope it would be worded differently.*

Clearly there are some issues since there shouldn't be a higher tax hike and those making between 250k and 500k and those making 500k to 2mil.

#Capital Gains Tax Rate Changes

###GRAPH: http://i.imgur.com/xqnxNFB.png

* The graph takes a look at what the new capital gains tax will look like with Sanders’ proposal. I made the same assumption with the 230k-411k bracket as I did in the last one.

Current (long term) tax rate for individuals:

* 0 - $9,225 = 0%
* $9,226 - 37,450 = 0%
* $37,451 - 90,750 = 15%
* $90,751 - 189,300 = 15%
* $189,301 - 411,500 = 15%
* $411,501 - 413,200 = 15%
* $413,201+ = 20%

Current for families: 

* 0 - $18,450 = 0%
* $18,451 - 79,900 = 0%
* $79,901 - 151,200 = 15%
* $151,201 - 230,450 = 15%
* $230,451 - 411,500 = 15%
* $411,501 - 464,850 = 15%
* $464,851+ = 20%

**Increases for individuals:**

*Note: I will be applying after Bernie's new tax rates*

* 0 - $9,225 = +0%
* $9,226 - 37,450 = +0%
* $37,451 - 90,750 = +0%
* $90,751 - 189,300 = +0%
* $189,301 - 411,500 = +0% (+22.75% for those above 250k)
* $411,501 - 413,200 = +24.75%
* $413,201 - 499,000 = +20.35%
* $500,000 - 2,000,000 = +19.95%
* $2,000,000 - 10,000,000 = +24.95%
* $10,000,000+ = +28.95%


**Increases for families:**

* 0 - $18,450 = +0%
* $18,451 - 79,900 = +0%
* $79,901 - 151,200 = +0%
* $151,201 - 230,450 = +0%
* $230,451 - 411,500 = +0% (+22.75% for those above 250k)

&gt; “From the beginning of this campaign Sen. Sanders has called for more debates. Secretary Clinton has not. Now she is asking to change the rules to schedule a debate next week that is not sanctioned by the DNC. Why is that? The answer is obvious. The dynamics of the race have changed and Sen. Sanders has significant momentum. Sen. Sanders is happy to have more debates but we are not going to schedule them on an ad hoc basis at the whim of the Clinton campaign. If Secretary Clinton wants more debates that’s great. We propose three additional debates. One in March, April and May and none on a Friday, Saturday or holiday weekend. And all of the three Democratic candidates must be invited. If the Clinton campaign will commit to this schedule, we would ask the DNC to arrange a debate in New Hampshire on Feb. 4.”",862

Then you look at the democrats and it’s a view of hope and increased growth, tolerance, better control of capitalism and risky betting run amok.  This isn’t to say that democrats have all the answers, but I tend to find myself believing that our country isn’t falling apart at the level proposed by the republican candidates.

Senator Warren, instead of playing politics why don't you use your considerable clout and connections to academia and apply pressure to your former employers and others in higher education.  Harvard is a money making powerhouse with revenue and donations that rival Fortune 1000 companies.  Harvard's endowment is bigger than the GDP of most countries.  They could show leadership on this issue by reducing or even eliminating tuition and not see a reduction in their endowment.

Tell that to the GOP in Indiana. We've got Republicans pushing bills to (1) stop repeated alcohol related crimes from disqualifying someone from a concealed carry permit, (2) remove the requirement for a concealed carry permit all together so everyone can carry a gun, and (3) permit weapons at public universities and state office buildings. 

I'm not anti-gun. I have a concealed carry permit, have been on the board of a non-profit that owned an outdoor shooting range, and have a Federal C&amp;R license.  These proposals are insane.

"If I report being raped in the 70's or 80's as a child (as many are coming forward now to do). The incidence rate (which yes is partly inferred) for the year the attack happened goes up, however the number of cases reported in 2016 might go up. So the report rate does not always reflect always the cases  that calendar year (it depends how the records are filed).

Also, if I had gone to the police 30 years ago and said that a man groped me in the subway the police would have asked me if I knew the man. ""No."" ""Then there is nothing we can do. Try to travel with an escort in the future."" Now such things are taken more seriously so reports are filed.

Finally some forms of sexual assault were not illegal until the late 80's, specifically when a man rapes the woman he is married to (or in some places, marries the woman he raped). While others were never prosecuted, specifically date-rape (you had to prove you were forced, which is easier than proving you were drugged without knowing what drugs might have been used) often dismissed as 'drunk slut' remorse.

For all these reasons. Even places that have had lowered gun control restriction over the past few decades, but, have come to be more supportive of sexual assault victims and recognized more types of sexual assault would have a report rate that is higher. These two things are totally uncorrelated. In order to claim correlation you *have* to use the *occurrence* rate! Occurrence rate is trying to take what we now define as sexual assault and project it backward...based on what records we have. Not based on the narrower definition that used to exist, but today's definition. It is also *definitely* inclusive of reports long after the fact.

&gt;Up to $14 billion of the total market is economically pointless profit for cable companies, according to an analysis by the Consumer Federation of America and Public Knowledge, a nonprofit Internet freedom group.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Markey and Blumenthal all signed on to the letter.**

&gt;After Markey and Blumenthal did their own pricing survey in July, they organized another letter to the FCC in November, specifically targeting set-top boxes. Sanders, Warren and Franken all signed on, as did Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Corey Booker (D-N.J.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

It's impossible to have freedom of religion without also having freedom from religion.

Scalia's engaging in special pleading when he claims it's meant ""you can be free to have any religion, but you must choose a religion.""

If one must be chosen, then it's not freedom of religion - because when you're deciding which one to follow and you've eliminated every other religion but one from contention, if you're then forced to pick that one because there's no alternate, you're then being forced into a religion which directly contravenes the Constitution.

"For me it isn't so much the fact that Clinton had a private email server and that she had highly classified national security information stored on there. 


My problem is that she thinks it isn't a big deal and that she is above the law. She wishes it would just all go away. ""Why shouldn't I be able to just do my own thing? I'm an important person!"" It speaks to a certain level of dishonesty that many Republican presidential candidates rail against in their speeches. If any State Department kept Top Secret Special Access information on their own computer, they would be crucified. General Petraeus was smacked around for releasing classified information to whatshername. 


I also understand her own internal rationality for having a private email server: there are legions of Republican political assassins who've made careers out of taking down Bill and Hillary Clinton. Anything they can get their hands on can and will be subpoena'd and twisted, rightly or not, into evidence to try and take her down. By having her own server she can have communications with her inner circle that can be deleted at any time. ""Oh, you've got a court order for my emails? Well, the servers were wiped last week. Sorry, no trace."" If she has communications over normal federal email servers, all that traffic is saved and can't be dumped on a moment's notice. 


I feel like she is a female Richard Nixon, and she has some right to be a little paranoid. There are lot of people that wanted to see her buried and gone long before she had ever even been in political office. But in her own mind that has justified so much ethically questionably stuff…

All the past debates, if you rated them not on what they said, but rather how comfortably they talked and how knowlegable they seemed, I'd say Hillary won all those debates.

She also didn't come out way ahead on some topics that she had seemed to win before like foreign affairs. 

The portion I do think she did well in was the start when it came to guns. However, she had the benefit of NBC also hitting Sanders hard during this portion of the debate.

Here are some quotes from GOP congressman about working with Bernie, and several articles about his past campaigns and record in elected office at local and national level

---
John McCain (R AZ)

&gt;""Negotiating with Bernie was not a usual experience, because he is very passionate and he and I are both very strong-willed people and we spend a lot of time banging our fists on the table and having the occasional four-letter word,"" McCain said. ""But at the end of the day, Bernie was result-oriented.""

Jeff Miller (R FL)

&gt;""He is very open and honest as he goes through the process,"" Miller said. ""You know where Bernie is coming from.""

Marco Rubio (R FL) defending Bernie at one of his own town halls last fall, when asked the difference between Sanders Socialism and the Cuban Communists Rubio's family fled:

&gt;“In fairness, they fled communism. There is social democracy, right, like you see in Europe, where government provides for every aspect of your life, but there’s consequence to that. They fled communism, which is beyond socialism, obviously where government controls society, but also government controls politics, life, the banning of religion, people were being executed.”

&gt;“What I appreciate about Bernie is he’s not trying to shirk from it. It’s what he believes in. He’s honest about it… I don’t personally have a problem with [Sanders] because he’s being honest about what he believes in. I’d love to have that debate.”

Jim Inhofe (R OK)

&gt;“Bernie Sanders is unique,” Inhofe says, “in that most of the Democrats I know in the Senate vote liberal and press-release conservative. Not Bernie. He’s a proud, in-the-heart, sincere liberal. I’ve never heard him once say something that didn’t come from his heart. That’s not true with all the people running for president, Democrats and Republican. I hold him in high regard.”

Roger Wicker (R MS)

&gt;I learned early on not to be auto­mat­ic­ally dis­missive of a Bernie Sanders ini­ti­at­ive or amend­ment.

Richard Burr (R NC)

&gt;I think he’s very out­spoken in terms of where he is ideo­lo­gic­ally. But when he gets down to the need to get le­gis­la­tion in­to law, then I find him to be one who’s will­ing to sit down and com­prom­ise and ne­go­ti­ate to get to a final product.

"**This is far more comprehensive and detailed than ANYTHING Clinton has released.**

#Relevant tax info

**HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?**

This plan has been estimated to cost $1.38 trillion per year.

**THIS PLAN WOULD BE FULLY PAID FOR BY:**

- A 6.2 percent income-based health care premium paid by employers.

Revenue raised: $630 billion per year.

- A 2.2 percent income-based premium paid by households.

Revenue raised: $210 billion per year.

**This year, a family of four taking the standard deduction can have income up
to $28,800 and not pay this tax under this plan.**

**A family of four making $50,000 a year taking the standard deduction would
only pay $466 this year.**

- Progressive income tax rates.

Revenue raised: $110 billion a year.

Under this plan the **marginal income tax rate** would be:

- 37 percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000.

- 43 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million.

- 48 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million. (In 2013, only
113,000 households, the top 0.08 percent of taxpayers, had income
between $2 million and $10 million.)

- 52 percent on income above $10 million. (In 2013, only 13,000
households, just 0.01 percent of taxpayers, had income exceeding $10
million.)

- Taxing capital gains and dividends the same as income from work.

Revenue raised: $92 billion per year.

Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest American in the country, has said that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. The reason is that he receives most of his income from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed
at a much lower rate than income from work. This plan will **end the special tax break for capital gains and dividends on household income above $250,000.**

- Limit tax deductions for rich.

Revenue raised: $15 billion per year

Under Bernie’s plan, **households making over $250,000 would no longer be
able to save more than 28 cents in taxes from every dollar in tax deductions.**
This limit would replace more complicated and less effective limits on tax
breaks for the rich including the AMT, the personal exemption phase-out and
the limit on itemized deductions.

- The Responsible Estate Tax.

Revenue raised: $21 billion per year.

This provision would **tax the estates of the wealthiest 0.3 percent (three-
tenths of 1 percent) of Americans who inherit over $3.5 million at progressive
rates and close loopholes in the estate tax.**

- Savings from health tax expenditures.

Revenue raised: $310 billion per year.",109

**Obergefell v. Hodges** *(legalizing gay marriage)*: 5-4. Dissenting: Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, Alito (conservatives). Decision authored by Kennedy.

**Citizens United** *(unlimiting some campaign spending by corporations)*: 5-4. Dissenting: Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor (liberals). 

**McCutcheon v. FEC** *(campaign finance, striking down contribution limits from individuals to candidates and parties)*: 5-4. Dissenting: Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Kagan (liberals). 

**Glossip v. Gross** *(states may use a drug linked to botching executions for death sentences)*: 5-4. Dissenting: Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, Sotomayor (liberals). 

**Multiple environmental regulation cases** *(removing EPA's mercury/other pollutant limits pending a cost/benefit analysis)*: 5-4. Dissenting: liberals. 

**Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission** *(voters can make an independent redistricting commission to fight legislative partisan gerrymandering)*: 5-4. Dissenting: conservatives minus Kennedy.

**Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar** *(states may prohibit judicial candidates from asking supporters for money)*: 5-4. Dissenting: Scalia, Alito, Thomas, Kennedy (Roberts joined the liberals). 

**Alabama Redistricting Cases** *(Legislature relied too much on race, creating high concentrations of black voters in some districts)*: 5-4. Dissenting: conservatives minus Kennedy.

**Burwell v. Hobby Lobby** *(corporations can't be required to pay for contraception coverage)*: 5-4. Dissenting: liberals. 

**Harris v. Quinn** *(some government workers cannot be required to pay union dues)*: 5-4. Dissenting: liberals. 

**Hall v. Florida** *(rejecting Florida's IQ cutoff as too rigid to decide which mentally disabled people must be spared the death penalty)*: 5-4. Dissenting: conservatives minus Kennedy.

**Town of Greece v. Galloway** *(allowing town boards to start their meetings with prayers specific to a religion)*: 5-4. Dissenting: liberals. 

***

In sum: 

Conservatives voted for Citizen's United, striking down individual contribution limits, allowing states to use an inhumane execution drug, stopping environmental protections, destroying unions, stopping contraceptive insurance coverage, and allowing a city to start its town meeting with specifically Christian prayers. Liberals voted against all of these decisions. 

Liberals voted to legalize gay marriage, restrict partisan gerrymandering, prohibiting judges from pressuring people for basically legal bribes, stopping gerrymandering attempts to minimize black representation, and preventing mentally disabled people from being executed. Conservatives voted against all of these.

That’s not true. On infrastructure, the site says, **“Hillary will fully pay for these investments through business tax reform.**” On education—a $350 billion proposal—it says **‘[the plan] will be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes and expenditures for the most fortunate.”** On paid leave, it says, **“She’ll ensure that the plan is fully paid for by a combination of tax reforms impacting the most fortunate.”** 

**Clinton also wants to provide more tax credits for child care and to create universal pre-K, but her website doesn’t offer any details for how she’d pay for those proposals at all.**

Then, that loan is repaid using campaign contributions. So if Cruz loaned $1,000,000 at 10% interest, he could personally make $70,000 in one year off of that loan, which would essentially be campaign donors putting money into his pockets.

Edit: I don't know if Cruz charged his campaign interest or not--this was more of a comment on the campaign finance system (that he legally could) than Cruz's actions themselves.

"As someone who's suffered with migraines since I was 3 years old, who's seen multiple doctors and neurologists' for them, and who's tried multiple medications for them, I agree that opiates don't do anything for migraines. I took Midrin for a decade, and it worked beautifully! But the FDA pulled it because it had never undergone clinical trials. So my doctor tried me on Imitrex. That only made my migraine's worse. We tried Maxalt, and it had no effect whatsoever. So they gave me Loratabs. They would work for a while, but the rebound headaches are a nightmare! I finally told my doctor that I didn't want them anymore. To try something else.

"Yep.  Wanna know who Trump reminds me of?  Huey Long.

Here's a speech of his from 1934: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hphgHi6FD8k

So many comparisons are possible with Trump.  He's partially ridiculous, with silly catch-phrases/arm movements and an often angry demeanor.  He talks aggressively, and speaks to the ""heart.""  He's a populist, raging against the political machine.

Huey Long is routinely called ""America's Hitler"", and his presidential aspirations were only stopped by assassination in 1935.

Edit: 'America's Hitler'-- its not because of racial issues, its because Huey Long (who was governor of Louisiana) represented the ""strong man"" persona that Trump echoes.  He ran Louisiana with an iron fist, jailing his political opponents, operated a proto-secret police, and his approval ratings were *through the roof.*  He built roads and highways, boosted the economy, and even forced through funding increases for black schools.

Its the classic benevolent dictator dream.  ""This is how liberty dies-- with roaring applause,"" and the like.",107

You can't advocate for a cause and resent the people who changed their minds for the opinion they held before. It really defeats the purpose of what you're trying to achieve. On this particular issue, Clinton's 'evolution' is not that different from many other politicians on both side of the aisle, who grew up at a time where that issue was just not on the political radar. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) comes to mind; she basically changed her opinion on gay mariage because, to paraphrase, she said her own children felt her stance on it was antiquated and looked at her oddly when she even raised the question of 'traditional' mariage. As for the HRC endorsement, they're just hedging their bets and, let's be honest, it probably hosts some people well-connected to the Democratic establishment, most likely their gay offspring. They have everything to gain and nothing to lose by backing Clinton; should Sanders win the nomination, their interests are not in danger precisely because Sanders has always been about civil rights. Clinton, on the other hand, may feel like she owes them a bit for that endorsement and push forward their interests over other priorities in her program. It's politics, folks...",163

We're not talking about Benghazi or Islamophobia, which are basically non-issues in the Democratic camp - why was there such a hard focus on that?

I admit Hillary got one of the toughest questions of the night - that first kid who asked about her failure among youth voters and her perception of dishonesty.  Chris Cuomo's mojo must have been all spent dry-humping Sanders about tax increases and big government because by the time it was Hillary's turn, he stood there glassy-eyed and with drool rolling down the side of his mouth while he let her ramble on about having battle scars or whatever the fuck she was talking about.

"Okay, I'm going to throw my two cents in because I'm so fed up with all the propaganda coming out of my country about our Gun Control Laws.

**Claim:** Australia has had no massacres since the Port Arthur Massacre

**Reality:** Not including massacres that [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia) recorded as having less than 4 deaths, we've had 8 massacres since Port Arthur (10 if you include incidents of less than 4 deaths). If you check the wikipedia article I linked, you'll see that not only have we still had massacres, but since Port Arthur almost half of our massacres have been arson attacks instead of firearm, which on average actually led to many more deaths per event (between 10-15) than gun massacres did (between 5-7).

There have also been knife/blunt instrument massacres since Port Arthur, as well as several firearm massacres.

When you say:

&gt;It's pretty clear that the gun laws helped greatly reduce gun massacres.

It's not relevant. The whole point of gun control is that it's supposed to reduce homicides, not ""homicides by guns"" otherwise what is the point?

If you have a look at the [Australian Homicide Statistics](http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html), in the graph titled: ""Homicide incidents in Australia, 1989-90 to 2006-07 (number)""

You can see that the gun buy-back program, introduced in 1996, did not affect the number of homicides that we were already predicted to have before the gun laws were even conceived. In other words, there's no evidence to suggest that the introduction of Australian Gun Control contributed to a decrease in overall homicides.

Also, if you look at the [Homicide weapon statistics](http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide/weapon.html) you can see that not only were knives always the more predominant weapon of choice for homicide even before gun control, but the use of knives   (percentage wise) to commit homicide has increased at the same time the use of guns has decreased (percentage wise).

**Claim:** Gun control led to a decrease in gun related suicides.

**Reality:** It did... but it's *total* suicides that matter, otherwise there's no point. In **[Trends in Hanging and Firearm Suicide Rates in Australia: Substitution of Method?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1521/suli.33.2.151.22775/abstract)**, the researchers found that:

&gt; When the firearm suicide rate for Australian males declined the hanging rate increased simultaneously, with no statistical difference in the rate of change of the two methods.

There has been an overall decline in total suicides but because there were suicide prevention programs introduced at the same time Gun Control laws were enacted, it can't be known if there was a causal link to Gun Control. You have to understand that the politicians who were promoting the success of the gun control measures in curbing suicide rates were the same people who introduced the laws.

They didn't actually say anything untrue, there was indeed a huge decrease in gun-related suicides, but if it hasn't made a huge difference to overall suicide then the program doesn't do what it's supposed to do, and that's prevent suicide. Saying one method of suicide has decreased while not accounting for substitution of method is propaganda.

"&gt;But truth doesn’t matter here – at all. Instead, the goal is to inherently delegitimize all critics of Hillary Clinton by accusing them of, or at least associating them with, sexism, thus distracting attention away from Clinton’s policy views, funding, and political history and on to the online behavior of anonymous, random, isolated people on the internet claiming to be Sanders supporters. It’s an effective weapon when wielded by Clinton operatives. But, given its blatant falsity, it has zero place in anything purporting to be “journalism.”

Nailed it.

&gt;Then there’s the most widely-cited example, used by that Mashable article as well as one from BBC entitled “Bernie Sanders supporters get a bad reputation online.” This example originated with the New Yorker TV critic (and Clinton supporter) Emily Nussbaum, who claimed that she was called a “psycho” by the “Feel the Bern crew” after she praised Clinton. Nussbaum’s claim was then repeatedly cited by pro-Clinton media figures when repeating the “Bernie Bro” theme. The problem with this example? The person who called her a “psycho” is a right-wing Tea Party supporter writing under a fake Twitter account of a GOP Congressman – not remotely a Sanders supporter.

"I've been a Bernie supporter since he announced that he was running for president. That said, up until recently I have acknowledged that it was a long shot and I was okay with putting my support behind Hillary if she won the Democratic nomination.

However, after the fourth Democratic debate where she got up on the podium and just lied and lied and LIED, saying she was the only supporter of a set of major issues (that Bernie has been behind for years), going after Bernie for shit he didn't do, taking close to a million dollars last year in speaking fees at Wall Street firms, I've changed my mind.

Up until this campaign cycle, I thought Democrats were far and ahead the better party. I saw the Republican corruption, the embracement of the Koch brothers, outright awful behavior, terrible policies, deprivation of basic human rights to women, disenfranchising minorities, proud Islamophobia -- in short, all of the reasons I still don't trust Republicans.

However, this election cycle changed my mind toward the Democratic Party. It has shown the DNC's true colors. With Hillary's 2008 campaign manager Debbie as the chair of the Democratic Party, unwavering establishment support for Hillary, and trying to subdue outsider Bernie at every turn, I'm done.

Now this is the first election cycle I really paid attention to. 2012 was the first presidential election I voted in. With a bunch of bad Republican nominees and eventually just Mitt Romney on the right and Obama on the left, it was an easy decision based on policy. But now this primary has been about so much more than platform. I have seen it as outsider vs. establishment politics, and I'm disgusting at how undemocratic the Democratic Party is. Shouldn't we have as many debates as possible? Shouldn't we be reaching out to voters? Shouldn't we talk about pragmatism versus idealism, or what idealism really means? We should be talking about where we want the party to go, and instead it feels like we are playing into what the Republicans and right wing pundits think of us, that we are a bunch of good ole boys that line up behind our establishment.

We progressives are stronger than this. If Hillary wins the nomination, I'm voting third party. Say what you will about splintering the vote, about the electoral college winner-take-all system, that I'm throwing away my vote. I used to say the same thing. But I refuse to vote for the lesser of two evils when we have a candidate I truly believe in who is being squashed by the establishment. It'd be one thing if Bernie was wholly unpopular. I could say I'm just not on the party's ideological platform. But instead, I see the powers that be, pushing Hillary forward and suppressing free thought. 

So if Hillary will be the one representing our party in November, well Green Party here I come.",118

Don't get me wrong, I firmly believe Reagan is one of the worst things to ever happen to this country, maybe *the* worst, politically, given how long and insidious his racism, classism, and worst of all bullshit trickle down economics have lingered, but in terms of behavior he wasn't anything like these people, and would have abhorred their antics even after his brain went a little squidgy from the dementia.",299

It was a fucking masterful play.  

That said, with this information today, I say fuck Dean.   

Edit- This: ""What happened is that they removed all of the other sound from the microphones, so only Dean's microphone was recording."" is a poorly-worded sentence.

The Republican Party- in the past 10 years has been hijacked by voters and politicians alike who are loud, bombastic, and I guess the best word to describe them is ""fake patriots.""

I'd vote Rand Paul over Bernie and Hillary any day. Now I'm stuck in a position where I like some of Bernie's policies, but hate his economic policies. I hate Hillary. Where I hate all of the current Republican leaders as well.

Maybe I should just not vote...Even though I know that is frowned upon.",106

There is really no other candidate who can hold a candle to him in this category. 

I'm no long afraid of universal health care. I have met numbers of educated people from around the globe from Canada to Ireland, and they all love their health care system. So if you Dems are smart enough to give him the nomination, he will have my vote.

"The only problem I have with the free tuition thing is the universities.  Every single time there is some sort of increase in financial aid for education, the universities just jack up tuition to suck it up.  I'm all for working towards making college free, but there needs to be some regulation on tuition fees in order to stop them from continuing to abuse the system.  I think this is one of those things where we need to take a step back and figure out *why* tuition is so high in the first place and address that before throwing more money at it only to have tuition continue to skyrocket.",138

If all the Cuckservatives spend 3 hours throwing a tantrum about Trump everyone and their grandma is going to be like ""Welp, Trump was right"" and just make his points rise.

"That's why I downvoted this post. The GOP and even Hillary supporters are trying to portray Bernie as a radical. Bernie of all people! Bernie Sanders exemplifies practicality, which is why he's more down-to-earth and relatable than other candidates. Ask Clinton about gay rights and she'll create a task force to determine how changing the law would affect her in the polls, then *afterward* come up with a pithy explanation to justify her choice. Ask Bernie about gay rights and he'd say - as he's always said - why deny millions of people their rights? Why weaken our military by minimizing their contributions or preventing orphans from finding loving parents? Why make it harder for people to get married and join their partner's health insurance? Why make this country more difficult to live in for so many people? He understands that Americans, like all people around the world, just want to live their lives with some basic assurances. That we can get married. Go to college. And ideally work a full-time job without living in poverty at the same time. Bernie is the epitome of practicality and especially when everyone appears to be ultra-conservatives or superliberals, we need his caliber of clarity and consistency to keep us united. I sincerely hope he wins.",112
"I see two possibilities, neither of which are exclusive and both of which will almost certainly happen.

1) Trump will still use these e-mails. They will dog Clinton throughout the entire campaign, and will certainly be his go-to rejoinder every time she cites her own experience or Trump's lack thereof. This will force the media to look into it, even if they don't want to anymore.

2) Republicans (who control congress and will regardless of who wins in November) will launch almost immediate investigations into whether or not Hillary Clinton broke the law, and if she received special treatment from the previous (current) administration for doing so. And I guarantee you that will easily turn something up, because the fact that she is receiving special treatment is undeniable.

She won't be charged, but only because of her connections. And the Republicans will make that the centerpiece of the campaign against her, and against her administration if she wins. I don't see how anyone can deny that.

Edit: Republicans can't credibly make a 'people vs. the powerful' campaign. They can make a 'This person is an elitist who doesn't think she has to follow the rules!' campaign stick, though, and that will have the exact same effect in the current environment.",102

One of the really big things Sanders reminds us is that he cannot do it alone.  Post-presidential election, this support doesn't end.  We have to focus on congress, on midterms.  Without midterms, ANY Dem president will be dead in the water.

Fortunately, for once, people are excited.  There are various reasons for that, but the point is that this is an unusual and one-of-a-kind opportunity to actually achieve some kind of change, instead of just lip service and a return to the status quo.

"And an Amendment to the United States Constitution would have set back gay rights for a generation or more. 

For those that slept through high school civics, recall that the Supreme Court can't overturn a Constitutional Amendment like it can overturn regular laws.

As far as I can tell, Bernie *did not* give an impassioned speech about how this bill was terrifically awful either, AND he did believe similar things to Clinton at the time, believing as late as 2008 that while he was comfortable with civil unions, he was not comfortable with gay marriage. 

These are two folks with long and complex histories. Bernie has a good track record, but was not a full throated advocate for our modern idea of equality either--his position on LGBT issues *has* evolved, which is FINE. Hillary's record is mixed too but I don't see a smoking gun in her record. Her husband's DADT policy *was* an improvement over the status quo--it ended the witch hunts for gays in the military though did not end the ban. I wish they had allowed gays in the military, but it's clear to me that our country was absolutely not there yet. 

When you look at their **policy proposals as candidates today** (cite: 
[*Sanders*](https://berniesanders.com/issues/fighting-for-lgbt-equality/), 
[*Clinton*](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/lgbt-equality/) )
, you'll see that Hillary's is exceptionally comprehensive. It's a fucking Christmas list for 2016 post-marriage-equality gay rights, including banning conversion therapy, addressing LGBT youth homelessness, upgrading discharge status for discharged vets, ending the ban on trans military personel, and comprehensively addressing HIV/AIDS coverage *and* expanded prevention measures.

Meanwhile, the Sanders's campaign does not mention HIV/AIDS *at all*, LGBT youth homelessness, LGBT veterans, the trans military ban, or conversion therapy.

I know Sanders supports Medicare for all which would improve access to HIV drugs for HIV positive people, but insurance alone isn't a *prevention* strategy. I know he's great on vetaran's issues, but I haven't heard him advocate for upgrading the discharge status for gay servicemen and women. Issues of LGBT youth homelessness *are quite distinct from youth homelessness resulting from other causes, and needs to be addressed as such,* and I wish he would. I would love to see him support banning conversion therapy, which has resulted in numerous LGBT suicides and fucked up the mental health of countless others. 

I'm **not** saying Sanders is anti-gay. He is certainly an advocate and an ally and has been for a long time. I **am** saying that Clinton's LGBT Policy Proposals are far more detailed and address issues of intersectionality in ways that Sanders campaign doesn't. I would absolutely applaud him if he were to address some of these issues specifically, but these are some serious issues I would like addressed before he gets an endorsement from any LGBT org.

Clinton on the other hand, *still*  after 20 years stakes out a moderate and already compromised position assuming now the other side will meet her there...problem is, in negotiations both sides always have to give ground.

"Iran's a really weird place. College educated Iranians are trending towards moderate behaviors more in line with western values, and they're frequently attempting to protest and organize against the Iranian hard-liners. But the working class Iranians still support the Ayatollah and hard right theocratic principles of Iran. So you have this mesh of major ideological polarization which lead to a country with some of the harshest capital punishment laws in the world. Rouhani is not solely representative of Iran's politics. It doesn't change the fact that hard-line religious conservatives still control Parliament, the judiciary and Iran's military under the Guardian Council.

The Ayatollah in Iran literally has the power to just ban certain candidates from Parliamentary elections. In 2012, 1/3 of candidates were simply disqualified as were certain political parties. Former Presidential candidate Mousavi still remains under house arrest just for being deemed a threat to the Iranian establishment. The Guardian Council also has final say on all new laws. And they still have one of the highest execution rates in the world, mostly for drug related crimes. 

These things should be kept in mind when speaking of Iran.

AND they didn't want to get involved with Bundy. Lol.

What Occurred -

&gt; The circumstances of both fires are worth examining. **The first occurred in 2001.** (the Father &amp; Son) According to prosecutors, several members of the Hammond family set this fire “less than three hours after Steven Hammond illegally shot several deer on BLM land,” a claim they corroborate by citing testimony from D.H., Dwight’s grandson and Steven’s nephew. The fire, moreover, “consumed 139 acres of public land and destroyed all evidence of the game violations.”

&gt; Additionally, the government claims that three men were camped nearby when the Hammonds’ started these fires, and that Steven and Dwight knew about these campers when they decided to start the fires anyway.

&gt; **Steven lit the second fire in 2006** (the Son) — he says that he did so as a preemptive burn in order to prevent an unrelated wild fire from spreading to the Hammond Ranch. At the time, however, the federal Bureau of Land Management had **imposed a “burn ban”** to protect firefighters who were busying trying to stop the wild fire. **A second fire, such as the one set by Steven, could have potentially spread and endangered the firefighters.**

The Verdict -

&gt; **So Dwight (the Father) was convicted of setting an illegal fire that burned federal land and Steven (the son) was convicted of setting two such fires.** One of these fires was allegedly set to cover up evidence of a different crime; it could have endangered the lives of several nearby campers; and it did indeed endanger one of the younger members of the Hammond clan. The other fire was set despite a federal order intended to protect the lives of firefighters.

Why the return to prison??? -

&gt; **They were found guilty by a jury of illegally burning federal government property.** They chose not to appeal that conviction. **The law requires a minimum 5 year sentence for that crime.** They convinced the federal trial judge that it was unconstitutional to impose that minimum in this case. **The government appealed (which it would virtually always do when a minimum sentence is found unconstitutional). The court of appeals said the minimum sentence was constitutional and ordered it imposed.**

Using this a quick reference to the 'PRO' Bundy group; getting a lot of 'pro gun' rights IM's atm.

Notation - The land in question (the land that Bundy's group has annexed), used to belong to a Native American community.

Notation 2 - The BLM was discounting access/prices to that land at 93 % percent; literally pennies on the dollar.

Notation 3 - Anyone or everyone, please use this information to destroy the false narrative about the Hammonds or Bundy being 'victims' of the system.

&gt;Okay, for context, it's only fair to include the full quote, which the original article does not.
""Responsibility belongs to mortgage lenders and brokers, who irresponsibly lowered underwriting standards, pushed risky mortgages, and hid the details in the fine print.
Responsibility belongs to the Administration and to regulators, who failed to provide adequate oversight, and who failed to respond to the chorus of reports that millions of families were being taken advantage of.
Responsibility belongs to the rating agencies, who woefully underestimated the risks involved in mortgage securities.
And certainly borrowers share responsibility as well. Homebuyers who paid extra fees to avoid documenting their income should have known they were getting in over their heads. Speculators who were busy buying two, three, four houses to sell for a quick buck don't deserve our sympathy.
But finally, responsibility also belongs to Wall Street, which not only enabled but often encouraged reckless mortgage lending. Mortgage lenders didn't have balance sheets big enough to write millions of loans on their own. So Wall Street originated and packaged the loans that common sense warned might very well have ended in collapse and foreclosure. Some people might say Wall Street only helped to distribute risk. I believe Wall Street shifted risk away from people who knew what was going on onto the people who did not.""
Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis, but Wall Street certainly had a hand in making it worse.
This isn't a valid criticism. And spreading this would be just as disingenuous as Hillary spreading her recent smears about Bernie's healthcare plan. Move along.",260

"If your relative won the lottery and gave you $600,000 it would likely forever change your relationship with that relative and if you're anything like me you would feel a bit indebted to that person in the sense that you could not let them down should they ask you for a favor. Goldman Sachs and many of the bankers who have contributed to Clinton have been fined hundreds of millions and in some cases billions of dollars by the federal government for breaking the law. What did these bankers do? They knowingly contributed to economic fraud that caused innocent people to lose their savings. They purposely impoverished people for their own financial gain, they are crony capitalists and they must be reigned in.

Clinton is a disgusting liar. At the last debate she said Sanders voted to repeal wall street regulation but forgot to point out that those same regulations are the ones written by politicians, lawyers, and lobbyists paid by the financial institutions themselves, those regulations are what are causing the economic problems we have been seeing.

Keep in mind that this is just the tip of the iceberg. Clinton has been paid millions in speaking fees and millions in ""campaign contributions"" and this isn't the only money Clinton has taken from elites in the financial sector. Sanders is right to criticize Obama because under his regime and under the future Clinton regime we will continue to see concentration of wealth at the top 1% and the destruction of the middle class. 

While some bankers and wall street executives may not like democrats, it does not change the fact that others do. Clinton doesn't even *need* the money she gets from financial executives. She could run her own campaign without even taking a dime in donations. 


edit: $600,000 is what she made from just Goldman Sachs over the course of a single year. She's taken money from many other financial institutions and other organizations too, and no, I would not expect her to fairly regulate the sectors of the economy that her financiers belong to. Whether it's the banking sector or the manufacturing sector or the tech sector. She's not working for the American people she's working for the people who contributed to her multi-millionaire status just like all the other politicians that accept bribes. **If she had been paid $600,000 to speak at KKK rallies would you be okay with it?** Her other contributors are irrelevant. 

She claims the big banks are running ads against her and she's telling the truth, where do you think the financial executives plan to get more money? From other banks of course (they've already taken the middle classes savings). So the financial execs Clinton works for will continue to contribute money and the ones she is trying to put out of business in favor of her contributors will continue to run ads against her and we're just going to continue to concentrate wealth at the top 1% under a Clinton administration.

It's not just the ranchers, it's nearly every Republican state. The Democratic states have to pay a HUGE amount of additional taxes to cover the deficit created by 20 something Republican states.

If you take a look at the federal expenditures of each state, the Republican states nearly all spend more than they pay in federal taxes. While the average Denocratic state contributes a surplus to the federal government over their cost. If you add the states up by party, Republicans have a multi trillion dollar deficit, while Democratic states pay a trillion dollar surplus over what they cost the federal government.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_taxation_and_spending_by_state

If it wasn't for Republicans, we would have a huge surplus. The Republicans literally rely on the very people they accuse of relying on them. It's completely backwards. 

**Edit:** Where are Republicans getting the idea that there are 27 Democratic states? How can states with majority Republican Senators, Representatives, and state legislatures be considered Democratic? 

Pennsylvania has 13 Republicans to 3 Democrats, and Virginia Republicans outnumber Democrats 3 to 1. Wisconsin has nearly twice as many Republicans. Why would we count their deficits as Democratic? 

Nebraska and Wyoming have ZERO Democrats serving at the federal level. Why the heck are their deficits counted against Democrats?

"Please remember when the Media blackout is mentioned it is referring to TV media where the older Demographic get's the majority of their news. Not online media where most of us get the poll results and subsequent articles on them. 

And for those calling this a conspiracy:

From Oct 2, 2015

&gt; Andrew Tyndall monitored broadcast news from ABC, NBC, and CBS and found that of the 504 minutes devoted thus far to the presidential race, **145 minutes had been dedicated to talking about “The Donald”**, that’s around 30 percent and there were **165 minutes allotted to Hillary Clinton**, with about half of that total talking about her email problems.
&gt; But what about Bernie? How much time is he really getting. We’ve all been complaining loudly that the networks have all but shunned him. **Is it as bad as we think it is? Well he’s gotten a paltry 8 minutes on network news. That’s less than 2 percent and this for the guy that is leading in Iowa and New Hampshire** and although I heavily question the methodology of the “national” polls, is doing well there too. The networks have devoted about that much time to Chis Christie, who most agree has no shot. **They’ve also handed Jeb Bush, despite his low polling numbers, somewhere around 43 minutes of airtime, which is 5 times what Bernie has gotten.**

Edit: I am not implying that there is currently a TV media blackout on Bernie, rather I just wanted to post this for full disclosure as it is not implausible to think this could not happen again. This study shows the clear bias the TV media have against Bernie and it would be naive to not remind people that this isn't a conspiracy but rather something that has actually happened. Draw your own conclusions from this as you will.

Edit 2: Some people have been calling me a conspiritard so here's a more recent study done by the [Tyndall report] (http://tyndallreport.com/comment/20/5773/)

CAMPAIGN 2016 COVERAGE: ANNUAL TOTALS FOR 2015 1. During 2015, Campaign 2016 logged more than 17 hours of coverage on the broadcast networks' weekday nightly newscasts (ABC, CBS and NBC combined).

2. The annual total of 1031 minutes is higher than any other penultimate year of the last seven Presidential campaigns, except for 2007 (1991 = 146; 1995 = 294; 1999 = 339; 2003 = 167; 2007 = 1072; 2011 = 790).

5. Donald Trump is by far the most newsworthy storyline of Campaign 2016, alone accounting for almost a third of all coverage (327 mins or 32%), more than the entire Democratic contest combined. The other GOP candidates, in order of prominence, were Jeb Bush (57 mins), Ben Carson (57), Marco Rubio (22).

6. **Hillary Rodham Clinton has been the second most newsworthy candidate (121 mins)**, with an additional 88 mins devoted to the controversy over her e-mails as Secretary of State and 29 mins to the investigations into the Benghazi Consulate attack. **Note: Not sure if those additional minutes are seperate from the total time she had or not.** **The second most newsworthy Democrat was a non-candidate: 73 mins on Joe Biden's decision not to run.**

7. **Noticeably under-covered have been the current second-placed candidate in each party's national opinion polls: Ted Cruz has attracted only 21 mins, Bernie Sanders only 20 mins.**",250

"Alright quick reply:

The law was challenged in the SCOTUS because it was mandating that people be penalized if they don't purchase the plan. Ironically, it was challenged because it wasn't socialist enough and people still had to pay to buy their plans. If the plan was single payer, as Sanders wants it, it would have no problem with being challenged, for the same reason that government taxing you to pave the road is not challenged in the SCOTUS.

As to how it could make it through congress, Sanders made it abundantly clear that this election is not just about solving all of our problems by electing him president. He believes that we need a more thoroughgoing change of the political system, that includes the next Congressional elections. Electing him president is just the first step.

"&gt; there was no Inspector General of the State Dept. during her tenure.

Half true.  There was an *acting* Inspector General, but he was ineligible for permanent assignment due to a potential conflict of interest.

According to [this WSJ article, it was Pres. Obama's responsibility to nominate a permanent Inspector General](http://www.wsj.com/articles/state-department-lacked-top-watchdog-during-hillary-clinton-tenure-1427239813).  He and/or Hillary seemed to prefer to keep the acting inspector general, Harold Geisel.  Mr. Geisel was barred by law from becoming permanent inspector general because he was a longtime foreign-service officer with ties to the State Department that may have prevented his independent oversight.

&gt;The vacancy in the top watchdog spot left the State Department with no confirmed inspector general for more than five years, the longest gap since the position was created in 1957, according to department records. While other agencies have had no permanent inspectors general at various points in recent years, some of those vacancies were due to a lack of confirmation by the Senate on nominees put forward by Mr. Obama.

&gt;Is isn’t clear whether Mrs. Clinton had any role in the lack of a nomination.

Note:  WSJ isn't an unbiased source of information, and I couldn't find another corroborating source aside from an article in the Washington Times, which itself is an extremely conservative site.

""One of the things that people get wrong is that he is the idealist or the dreamer.

I don’t think he’s the dreamer. We’ve been sold status quo dreams all of these years and some of us can’t recognize the real from the dream anymore. Bernie Sanders is real, and he’s discussing the things that we need. """,871

The Bundy's lost a federal case and a state case that was basically based on from what I can gather ""Umm we lived here a long time so erm we have like rights to this land."" they lost both cases. It's people in the middle of nowhere thinking they own the land around them because no one else is around, they don't. If it was a city it would be like living next to the post office and saying it's mine because I lived here a long time. They are criminals.

Trump is a bombastic idiot but they pretty much believe they can make deals with him when he's actually in office. After all, if he wasn't making deals once he got in, he'd lose all his credibility.

_______________________________________________________

Sanders hasn't been effective courting black voters. I have seen him making strides by talking about the war on drugs and police brutality. But the key is he needs to really sell why he can fix this and why Hillary Clinton cannot. Many black voters, including my own relatives are already convinced Hillary will be good enough, so he can't sway them without either being a 100x better or by making them question their faith in Hillary.

Many will ask why many black voters are satisfied with Hillary Clinton. There are a number of reasons for this. For one she has done a good job of being visible and accessible to black leadership, especially in the South. She has met with black lives matter leaders and the parents of victims of police brutality. Regardless of if you believe this is genuine or not, many people see this and that is good enough for them. She has a huge name recognition advantage which matters. Black voters have a history of not being the most informed voters and also voting for those they think will win not those that best align with them. Its essentially about defensive voting to make sure whoever wins knows you were on their side. Then at least within the youth population there is a lot of crossover between the same people who would be hyped for black president as a female one. While I'm not condoning voting on this, or even saying that a majority of anyone does this, there are people who are doing it. 

When it comes to Sanders himself, until recently he has been avoiding treading into the identity politics game. In many ways it speaks to his authenticity about the passion he has for specific economic issues in this country. However the democrats base very much feeds into identity politics and Hillary is willing to play that game. Her video on gay marriage (ignoring her flip flop), her abuela comments, etc all prove she's willing to play that angle and its a very effective strategy. 

Sanders has great policies and its great that he's talking about police brutality, the war on drugs, youth unemployment and other issues that predominately effect black Americans. However, many of his supporters are acting as barriers to entry to Sanders group. Many within the Sanders base are essentially the liberal version of the all lives matter crowd. You'll hear things like ""race doesn't matter its all about poverty"" some die hard sanders supporters. The truth is both matters, and the only thing any minority hears from that is an invalidation of their experiences. **If you want to debate the previous statement go for it I'll respond**. Or in other cases you'll see people saying just because Sanders marched with MLK, or has the support of Killer Mike (who know one white or black cares about) he should get their vote. That kind of stuff just becomes condescending and again pushes away potential supporters. Sanders needs to do what he does best, address a community with a well thought out and very **honest** discussion. The support will come after that as long as the rest of his base doesn't get in the way.

"Be careful about reading these numbers.  They only measured ""likely caucus participants"", but they did *not* adjust the numbers to account for caucus delegate proportionality.

The difference between a primary election and a caucus, and the part that may end up being a bit problematic for Bernie, is that delegates are allocated in a caucus *by precinct*, not by popular vote statewide; a very critical factor which this poll **does not** account for.

Sanders' has an enormous lead over Clinton in Black Hawk County, home of the University of Northern Iowa; Johnson County, home to the University of Iowa; and Story County, home to Iowa State University.  His numbers are 52 percent to 30 percent in those counties.  Those three counties account for 27 percent of his supporters statewide; but they only hold 21 percent of likely caucus participants, and they're only in a handful of precincts who can only, at most, choose a small number of delegates (I don't have the exact number handy, but I believe it's around 18 percent of the state's delegates).

This very possibly will end up having a sort of electoral-college-like effect on how his support will translate into delegates.  It's looking pretty likely that he'll end up winning the popular vote in the state but still ending up losing in delegates because Clinton's support isn't as concentrated in (and thus limited by) the urban/college precincts.

If you're out there phone banking or knocking on doors for Bernie; try to do it out in more rural areas.  Widening where his support is will be much more critical to his victory than deepening it in the areas he's already going to win.",292
"I've seen this type of response a lot--a bunch of people voting Hillary because she's ""more electable"" and they ""need to have a democrat in office"" kind of response. I wonder how many more people will see they can now cast their vote to Sanders to obtain the same result?",241

"It was definitely a misstep but it's not like you can really say you didn't see something like this coming.  Hillary Clinton is politicking.  Using her daughter was a strategy.  Hillary Clinton doesn't see the the Presidency as a way to serve the people.  She doesn't see it as a way to make the country better.  She see it as an ACHIEVEMENT.  It's like a football team trying to win the Super Bowl.  They make adjustments.  They change strategy.  If something they are doing isn't working then they do something else depending on who they are up against.  There's a plan to win.  Things are calculated.  The POTUS is a championship trophy to Hillary Clinton.

Bernie Sanders has been saying the same things for decades.  It's not an achievement for him to become President.  It's a way for him to make the country a better place.  It's why his platform and messages have always been the same.  He actually believes in them.  Even if you don't think they're any good, he's at least honest enough to do something he believes in instead of doing or saying whatever it is he thinks will win him the trophy.",190

"The whole system has skewed right. The current Democratic party is basically the Republican party of two decades ago, and the Republican party is now right wing extremists and religious fundamentalists. 

We don't need an overhaul of the GOP, we need a new left wing party in this country. If a strong left can emerge, it will turn the Democrat party into the new Republicans. The GOP will evaporate into the Democratic party, and into splinter groups of hard right minority parties.  

It would basically reset the scales and restore balance and centrism to the system.",186
