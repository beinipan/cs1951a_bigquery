I'm own newer rifles as well. I own one AR-15 and I'm pieceing together a another as well. If I had I choice though I'd pick one of old guns over the AR any day. I still support people owning what ever kind of guns they want for the fact I live in a very liberal place and have talked to people [ceasefire] who said they won't be happy until there are no guns at all in the hands of the civilian population. I support gun ownership now because by the time people are demanding I turn in my Springfield musket made in 1863 it will be too late.,1
"You don't really understand what I am saying. I am not making any judgements about communism, good or bad. I am also not saying that historical examples are useless, because there are obvious examples of how communism has been unsuccessful. What I am saying is that just because you know that it has been unsuccessful doesn't mean that you understand why. As a political scientist, I think that it's pretty arrogant and useless to dismiss a concept as historically important as communism without understanding why. In each of the examples you've given there are many other factors at play (historical, societal, geo-political, how communism was specifically implemented, etc.) that are unique to each case. How can you claim that you don't need to know anything beyond the fact that they a) were/are communist states and b) they were unsuccessful to know WHY things played out the way they did?

This day is called the feast of Crispian:

He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,

Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,

And rouse him at the name of Crispian.

 

He that shall see this day and live old age,

Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,

And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispin's:'

Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.

And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'

 

Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,

But he'll remember with advantages

What feats he did that day.

Then shall our names,

Familiar in their mouths as household words,

Harry the king,

Bedford and Exeter,

Warwick and Talbot,

Salisbury and Gloucester,

Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.

 

This story shall the good man teach his son;

And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,

From this day to the ending of the world,

But we in it shall be remember'd;

 

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;

For he to-day that sheds his blood with me

Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,

This day shall gentle his condition:

And gentlemen in England now a-bed

Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,

And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks

That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

Did you know that Chief Justice Roberts appoints the judges of the secret FISA court which rubber stamps government surveillance?

I'll admit that not everything I predicted may have come to pass, but I can pretty much guarantee we wouldn't have invaded Iraq. Quite likely Afghanistan would've been handled like Obama has handled Libya or Syria or ISIS-controlled regions. I.e. no troops on the ground and full blown wars.

The Mexican government wasn't really angelic in the whole thing, but the motive of enforcing a humanitarian anti-slavery law lands them pretty objectively ""on the right side"" of history. 

As an aside, the actual siege of the Alamo and its historiography is a super interesting topic itself. American historians through the 19th and early 20th centuries never even read the Mexican battle reports, and relied mostly on the later exaggerated accounts of the handful of survivors. ",18

Now, what they did was, they took those numbers only from the surveys they got sent back. And only people who believe in aliens or  funny guys sent them back so the figures where all wrong.

This big developer puts out a lot of games. Like Super Awesome Sword Guy. And that's the main reason you wanted to test for this company.

However, they also put out Jimmy Jimsom's Hyper Realistic Cricket Simulator.

And that's the gamr you get to work on.

So.you are given a broken early.version of a game that, best case scenario in its final form is a pile of boring. And you need to play through the whole game. With every guy. Using every bat or whatever they use in cricket. And you find about 16 hours in that bat #6 makes the ball drift slightly more to the left.

So you have to play through the game again, exactly.the same, to see if it happens again.

And one more time to make sure that's the way it happens.

And you report it. And it gets patched.

So back to square one. Do it all again.

Oh hey, your buddy found a bug too.

Time to run through all the bugs youve.gotten so far to see if they happen again.

And then the game is meant to launch in a few months. So now youre working 12 hour days.

And then after about 600 hourd of testing, turns out the game got cancelled.

" Smile. Believe it or not, smiling or not smiling makes up most of what people think of as ""attractive"". Think back on movies you've seen, which leading men really stood out as the handsome, attractive ones.  Our brains are programmed to be attracted to smiles from the time we are infants, and it can do miracles toward putting that 'special something' into your otherwise unremarkable face. If people don't even remember what you look like, often, they will be able to recall your genuine grin or laugh. Be open to thinking of yourself as attractive. Most of the time, people who feel that they are ugly shut themselves off from the rest of the world for fear that it will hurt them. In their opinion, the world's expected disapproval seems deserved. It is not. Most of the time, others only respond to a person as 'ugly' because that person responds to themselves as 'ugly.' Stand looking into the mirror, and react to what you see as if it were another person. Treat yourself with the common decency you'd show to a stranger. You'd never walk up to a stranger and say, ""Wow, look at how ugly you are!"" So don't do it to yourself. Be polite to yourself, and offer to help that person in the mirror in any way that you can, to look better and to feel better about how they do look, and then actually do it! Common courtesy to yourself can go a long way toward breaking the image of 'ugly' in your mind. Keep it up. No matter how silly you feel at first, remember the steps: smile, be open to thinking of yourself as attractive, treat yourself as courteously and helpfully as you would a to stranger, and groom yourself well. Progress can come gradually, and it's only a fast-food mentality that says we have to have everything overnight. ",4

And guys who stand in groups at street corners just to harass someone will back off if you walk like you're ready to punch or nut-smash the first guy who says something to you. What kind of clothes you wear has zero effect on these guys, even tattoos.

Storytime?,2

"well to put it in a frame of progress you can see the progress all around you. Buildings for instance have crazy architecture from computers and hydraulic machines (2 techs that have a few hundred years between them).  progress in homes is harder to see but you can see it. copper wire was introduced when fires were started because of the aluminum wiring. Fire codes generally dictate these changes, as new tech requires a high first stage production costs and then become lower over time and who wants to pay a super high amount for a house that might not necessarily be the best course.  

Art is even less valued now as it's seen largely as a poor mans dream.  

I know people tend to think that there are barriers that when we cross we transform into another version of the human race but the truth is that these transitions come slow (largely not noticeable) with the odd one that's faster in pace (changes things in 20 years or less).  A good example of the slow pace change is computers.  Believe it or not binary was discovered well before the transistor (like 300 years before),  but only the computer made it a very useful discovery (just think Gottfried Wilhelm never understood what it could be used for).  While most of us see the path to the smart phone as a very quick transition at it's root uses a tech that was developed over 300 years ago.  For a better look at the progression understand that computers only got smaller as more accurate cutting techniques became available (yes like cutting a piece of paper). 

The economy actually does change very quickly; credit cards, derivatives, and tax sheltered retirement plans are some of the most recent additions.  As changes in the economy largely come from a very select few.  

So don't think so little of the human race, try to see it from the prospective that it can get over great obstacles but they will always take time.",1

Basic social skills - be interested in the other person, notice if you're boring them, don't do weird things on the first date (I know, I know, you're special and lovable. But people overlook your weird idiosyncrasies once they're already invested in you, they don't need them up front)

Be a good person, unrelated to dating - be kind, have goals you pursue, be someone people can rely on. Don't be a manchild. Not for anyone else, but for yourself- no one likes a manchild, including the manchild. 

Love yourself - including making the changes necessary to be lovable to yourself. Love life - including making the changes necessary to love your life. Loving yourself and life is magnetic, it draws people to you.

Of course some of this data is not first hand from measuring instruments as they were not around at the last ice age but they are extracted from other stuff. Assume for a moment therefore they are reliable. The argument goes that IF the world has , pre our massive industrial energy use, shown such wide variations then how can we know if any fluctuations measured over recent small timescales are due to anthropomorphic interference as opposed to natural (non human) variations.

"[Code Names](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames).  It's the most fun, easiest game I've played in a long time.  

A 5x5 grid of words is generated in the form of random cards.  The words can be anything from ""robin"" to ""lap"" to ""Tokyo"".  In a standard game (2 vs 2), two people are the ""spies"" and two are the ""spymasters"".  The spymasters must get their teammates to guess the correct words in the grid, and only the spymasters know which words are theirs.  There are words in the grid that belong to each team, neutral ""civilians"", and a single instant-lose ""assassin"".  

The way the spymasters give hints to their teammates is by saying a one-word clue and a number.  The clue can be any single word or proper noun (such as ""Scooby Doo"" or ""Game of Thrones""), and the number is how many words on the grid will fall under that clue.  So, if someone needs to get their partner to guess ""mouse"", ""princess"", and ""force"", they could give the hint ""Disney, three"" (an actual example for a game I've played).  The spymasters cannot give any other hints or react in any way.  If the spies guess a wrong word, their turn ends and it passes to the other team.  The team who guesses all of their words first wins.

There's plenty of strategy involved in such a simple game.  The spies can always make one more guess than the number their spymaster gives them.  So they can keep clues from previous turns in mind if they missed one, and have guesses left over.  The spymaster also has to look over the grid to ensure that their clues won't cause their teammate to guess incorrectly.  They have to be careful to avoid giving points to the other team, or having their teammate guess the assassin.  ",1

"Just about everything my friends and I did as a kid, would get all of us taken away from our parents and our parents arrested, if it was todays world. It really blows my mind, the amount of sheltering and coddling that goes on these days. 

We spent all of our time, either in the woods looking for places to skinny dip/build a fort/search for frogs, riding our bikes around the neighborhoods, or hanging out enmasse outside of the local movie theatre. All of us were under the age of 15. All of us were outside from the break of dawn until after dinner time in the summer. Some of us were as young as 3 and being supervised by an older sibling.

None of us died. None of us were kidnapped or seriously injured. In fact, if anything, it helped us grow and function socially as adults. In todays world? We'd all be yoked up by CPS, forced into foster care and our parents would be arrested and shunned by society for being negligent. I MEAN REALLY??

So thank you, modern, uptight and bored soccer moms for your diligence. By diligence I mean sticking your nose where it does not belong. My kids will never understand the joy of finding a hidden stream, chock full of craw-dads while they adventure through the woods behind the house on their own. 

Seriously. People need to chill out on the whole call CPS thing. Unless you are directly in the situation? You most likely have no idea whats actually going on when it comes to the child of a stranger. Just because a kid is outside does not mean he is being neglected. It means he wanted some fresh air. Check yourself. 

When I was growing up, if a neighbor found a wandering child? They would walk the child home, or try to find the parents before calling ANYONE. Shit happens and kids are sneaky. Being a parent is hard enough without every Debbie Do-Gooder reporting on her fellow parents. This is NOT Orwells 1984 and kids NEED the freedom to run sometimes. Be part of the community or mind your own fucking business; unless you have viable proof of an actual abuse. More often than not, there is no abuse. Just a nosy neighbor that has a problem with the way other people rear their own offspring.

The forest temple already has unsettling music and just the way it all went down. Shadow suddenly grows, I'm hearing wind, then something grabs me from above and links scream did it to me. I remember shutting off the console and needing to collect myself. I spent the next 5 years terrified that they were gonna get me in real life and i was always looking up at the ceiling.

"Oh, man. The cat thing.

We had a neighbor bring a cat into our apartment unannounced. Pretty decent sized cat, maybe 10 or 12 lbs. His first decision was to attack MY cat.

My cat was not 10 or 12 lbs.

He was a Maine Coon mix, just over 25 lbs, and basically the devil incarnate. Years later, when he was an old guy and dying of intestinal lymphoma, it took four vet techs and the vet to hold the crazy bastard down and get a blood sample. Two of them needed medical attention afterwards.

So this pure white, froofy little fur ball jumps into him, and he doesn't go down. He leans away, stares for a few seconds as furball swipes at him...then slowly opens his mouth and hisses.

What followed has to be on the shortlist for top 5 most one sided cat fights.

Eventually we pried my guy off the other cat long enough for him to get away and run behind a piano. We put Stretch in my bedroom and tried to coax furball out from his hiding place. It took an hour.

The moral of the story is to not bring your cat around other cats without asking first, because the other cat might be a fucking murderer.",112

I'm going to assume that for the majority of people living near that poverty line, food/utilities/house/car make up a vast majority of the budget. However, these things in and of themselves may rely on chinese production factors. Assuming that 1/3rd of the poverty line's consumption experiences a 5.5 times increase in production cost, you get:

11/3 = 3.667

3.667 *5.5 =20.16

(11-3.667) +  20.16 = 27.493

that's all down by a factor of 1000, and maybe a bit generous with 1/3 of production and 5.5x increase. It's probably closer to 22,000 to 24,000",1

"I don't know if this counts as ""bizarre,"" but the one I remember best happened when I was in high school. This was back before caller ID was a common thing, so wrong numbers were more fun—you *never* knew who was calling until you picked up, it could be anyone!—and since I was an asshole kid, I liked to fuck with wrong numbers (and telemarketers) whenever possible. One night around 10 PM, I got a call from someone whose voice I didn't recognize. Without even a hello, he said, ""Hey, we just picked up the beer and we'll be right over."" Without skipping a beat, I said, ""Cool, just come in the back, the door's unlocked."" The guy responded, ""See you soon,"" and hung up.

---

Another bizarre oddity of the phone system: For a while, about 50% of the times I called a friend of mine, I'd get randomly connected to someone else. Some voice I didn't recognize would pick up and I'd just say, ""Uh, Jamie?"" and they'd say no and hang up. I was dialing the number I had saved in my phone, and whenever it would happen, I'd call the same number again and eventually get through to him. Never figured out why I was irregularly but frequently getting connected to a random person instead.",2

These are the single greatest representation of the next generation in my mind. They are a get rich quick scheme that sell you on the idea of not working hard for massive returns all working on your own schedule and not obeying a boss or having any kind of manager. Like the amount of idealistic laziness it takes to fall into that shit is 100% the next generation. I feel so bad about this but one of my best friends does this for a living he is a recruiter for one of them and his job is to flash a black amex around while wearing expensive stuff and recruit 18 year olds to do this. He makes insane money during the summer because he goes to sober grads and community college campuses and hooks kids who are looking for what they want to do in life. He just preys on these kids and he is so good at hooking them its really kind of frightening. He gets a tidy sum for every person he gets to sign a contract with them and a bonus based on if they actually sell stuff.,1

"It's well recognized that the political industry is shady, but here's how shady:  most candidates spend very little of their actual time campaigning. Most of it is actually spent on the phone, calling through massive lists of past and likely donors and begging them for money. Much like telemarketers, a candidates viability is directly proportional to how much money he can raise for himself and the Party.

There's a call center in the capitol building where representatives go to make calls when not doing actual work.  Campaign costs are so high that it's usually years before incumbents have built large enough warchests to get away from that. 

Most politicians hate this but are forced to beg and grovel by necessity. The aide who wrote that ""tell all"" book about how much Joe Biden was an asshole did a lot of Biden's finance work. Biden threw him out of the car because the aide wanted him to call donors on the ride to another event. 

TLDR: our elected officials are groveling telemarketers ",1

"&gt; I disagreed that government can universally be compared to mafias or abusive spouses.

Ah, okay. I meant in that regard. Sorry if it came off as something different. I meant to say that they are the same in that morality doesn't change from one to another.

&gt; I do so every year, for multiple countries. The banking regulations in the US are negligible in comparison to those of other countries. Try reading China's banking regulations. Fun stuff.

I'm sure that's true, but we were talking about the existence of regulations, of which there are many in the US banking system.

&gt; Of course not. I have no reason to force George to do anything. However, suppose I don't have enough money to help Oliver out. What does that mean for Oliver? What does that mean for his family? You speak of morality - is it morally right to let Oliver and his family suffer because of their bad luck?

It's unfortunate, but we cannot say that it is universally immoral to not help someone since one cannot help all who need help at all times. Whether it be Oliver or a disabled fisherman, the question is who should decide who gives? Obviously the answer is that only George should decide how much George gives. Oliver's hard times don't entitle him to George's property or labor, and the same goes for the disabled fisherman. To suggest otherwise is to institutionalize theft and slavery.

&gt; Would you threaten people with violence to save this poor, innocent person?

No, of course not!

&gt; However, if you didn't pay taxes, I would expect you to not use the amenities that taxes buy you.

You're putting the cart before the horse here. Taxes don't buy services on their own. The state monopolizes roads first, then taxes, then pays companies for roads. If I'm not consenting to the monopolization by force and the taxation by force, I have no obligation to pay or to stay off of the roads. If a feudal lord or a slave master takes all of the land by force, the serfs/slaves don't owe labor/money to the lord/master in order to eat because they are not in that position by matter of choice or contract but rather by direct circumstance of being enslaved. The onus is not on me to not use roads or not work. While I don't have a positive right to either, I should be free to contract with road building companies and employers as I see fit. Monopoly isn't justification for monopoly.

&gt; Let's suppose that I, along with the rest of the neighbourhood, thinks that what you're doing is fantastic, and we all chip in to support you. Indeed, we're so enamoured by the prospect of a lawn mowing service that we name you official lawn mower of our neighbourhood. Then a new person moves in next door, and they hate this service. They rail and protest against paying the fee, but you say it's all or nothing - either that new person pays along with the rest of us, or you don't mow any of our lawns. We're all dismayed, because we really, really like your lawn mowing service. What happens now? Should the new person move? Or should everyone else in the neighbourhood suffer?

Easy. You don't have a right to force this person to pay for lawn mowing service, period. It's his property so he has that choice. The only way in which you could claim that you have the right to force him to pay for the service is if a condition of buying the property was to agree to a certain term of the lawn mowing service - in which case you would actually have to have some form of ownership over the property in the first place. **This is entirely predicated upon legitimacy of ownership, which cannot come from brute force or mere democratic vote.**

&gt; The problem with politics is that 'should' questions become highly subjective. Why 'should' the rest of us have to lose something we really like just because one person doesn't like it?

Because that person owns himself, that's why. The concepts of theft and slavery don't preclude collective versions. They are just as immoral when done by a collective as when done by an individual.",1

"The GMO is not directly harming an ecosystem.  Every season we till a crop, say corn (which is highly nutrient-intensive; it draws a lot more nutrients from soil than other crops), that crop removes nutrients from the soil that need to be replenished, which the soil naturally does by itself.  This does not happen in a matter of days or weeks or even a winter.  Historically, we have developed methods of crop rotation, resting soil, grazing, and compost fertilizers to help revive soil between plantings, which has worked, but has economic drawbacks towards labor costs and profitability.  During the 20th and 21st centuries, we have 'freed' ourselves from the need to do this, because we can now produce synthetic fertilizers (which tend to feed the plant directly, rather than replenish the soil itself) and GMOs, which can both increase the effectiveness of these fertilizers and thrive in less-than-ideal soil conditions.  This has removed the incentive to care for soil health in favor of higher profitability and lower labor costs.  Dead soil can take decades to replenish itself to be able to sustain most plant life.  So after intensive agricultural practices like we use today, a plot of land that could once sustain a diversity of plants, and therefore animals, will not be able to do so any more without the aid of GMOs and fertilizers.  In this sense the GMOs are not directly destroying the ecosystem, but we are using them in a way that allows our agricultural system to damage ecosystems that it once tried to sustain.",9

"we are similar in some ways. i was tested at 8 and my score was in the 97th percentile (about 128). this ""high functioning retard"" feeling and depression, yes. maybe that comes from how our schooling is largely propaganda. we feel that our potential has been stunted. even in gifted ed, we are molded to be useful to the slave system in place. 

i got d's in algebra. then the college they shoo-ed me into trig, where i got a c. i have always had a bone-deep feeling that math is taught backward. in this way, the powers that be can get teams of ""mathemeticians, engineers, and physicists"" (coordinate junkies) working on things they themselves can't really describe in a big-picture way. this is handy for hiding evil works such as wmd building. if the scientists working on a thing don't even fully know what they're doing, but are specialized enough to complete their fraction of the project.. no one person or even team can cough up any cohesive information to expose the elite as the war-commissioners they are.

either way, here is an example of math taught more reasonably, in case you haven't seen it yet. it's truly fun to think about.

"Male circumcision is only necessary in very few cases, most circumcisions are done for RELIGIOUS purposes, and the amount of propaganda thrown around to make it ""ok"" to do it has misled people to think there is actually any sort of benefit to it.

The fact is, there is no REAL benefit to cutting off a piece of your penis. There are very tiny ones, like your penis being cleaner, but showering regularly will do the same thing anyways, so theres no need.

Circumcision, 99% of the time, is unnecessary (and usually forced) mutilation.

Oh, and yes, you do feel pleasure in the foreskin, it's actually quite sensitive, you lose alot of feeling in your penis after circumcision. Im sorry to hear that you were subjected to this terrible ritual of mutilation as a child, against your will.

People can go get circumcisions if they want, theres no real health benefit to it but if they want to, by all means go ahead, what is the issue is lying to people trying to convince them that they will be much healthier without a foreskin, or performing circumcision on a child who has no say in the matter.",3

EU4 is all about the nation. You control and usually try to exand the nation. There are still rulers, but they aren't characters in the same way as CKII, but are more representations of how good your government is at administration, diplomacy, and military under their rule. Generally it's advised to start as a larger nation (ottomans, Spain, England, or Portugal) so that you can either lose some land when you piss off all your neighbors, or simply conquer all your neighbors.

Then its another two years of ""real life experience"" before we can start seeing the two or three psychiatrists that need to approve us for surgery. 

&gt; I've heard many young people tell me they are pansexual, when i ask them if they would have sex with a cat, or a chicken, they get mad, they say of course not. They're not pansexual, they just like the fancy term.

Pansexual just means they are attracted to any gender trans or not, not whatever stupid shit you think it is.

[3.5% of adults in the United States identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual and an estimated 0.3% of adults are transgender.](http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Gates-How-Many-People-LGBT-Apr-2011.pdf) Any real citable increase in that percentage is due to ever increasing acceptance of LGBT people, making them brave enough to come out and be who they are.

"Yes- I can't respect someone who buys a pug from a breeder. They're the ""thing"" just now and it's ridiculous, you shouldn't buy a dog to go along with a trend. They end up with all kinds of health issues, mostly breathing issues, because they're bred to have big flat heads. You can't say that you love animals and then pay for an animal that's basically in discomfort its' entire life. 

edit: I seem to have struck a chord with a lot of pug owners. Just to make it clear, if you buy a pug puppy from a breeder, this is what you're paying for so that you can have your ""cute"" flat head:

* Serious breathing difficulties

* High blood pressure

* Fainting or collapsing due to a lack of oxygen

* Facial skin fold infections

* Serious eye problems

* Excessive flatulence due to excessive gulping and swallowing of air to try to overcome their breathing difficulties

* Difficulty walking

* Highly disrupted sleep

If you've adopted your pug from a shelter, that's fine. But most people I've met with them or have seen on youtube have got them as puppies, so they've paid a breeder to make a dog with these health defects on purpose. There are some responsible breeders who will breed pugs to be able to breathe and walk fine, but they're few and far between.",-3

"This is a copy of a comment I left on a thread a few months ago about kidnapping:


When I was 12, my parents separated. Things had always been nasty between them so I was glad that my mom had kicked my dad out. A few days later, my dad showed up at my middle school to pick my sister and me up (this was before schools were crazy strict about who kids left with). He said that he had talked to our mom and she told him it was okay to pick us up and spend the evening with us. So we get into his pickup, and I immediately notice that his shotgun is hanging on the rack of the back window (I used to go hunting with him, so I knew it was off season and that it was weird for the gun to be there). He calls our mom a little ways into the drive and says ""I've got the girls. I'll bring them home when I can come too. If not, tough shit."" He hung up. 


She called and called and he eventually turned his phone off. My mom said she called the police but because they were still legally married with no custody arrangement, there was nothing they could do. 


My dad ended up taking us to his mom's house. I remember him crying and asking if I would choose him in the divorce. I said no, I wanted to stay with my mom, and he starts throwing his head against the wall! The wall is dented and bloody, and he's got a couple knots swelling on his forehead. He said ""see, this is what you make me do. You don't wanna make this any harder on me, do you sweetheart?"" Just thinking about that now makes me sick to my stomach. 


So we're there for a couple days, my mom came and knocked on the door. My dad called the cops on her for trespassing so she had to leave. Another day or two go by, and he finally says he'll take me to Lowe's (where my mom worked at the time) to see her and say hi. We walk in, start going down the lumber aisle, and I see my mom towards the back. She's sees me and drops to her knees, crying, and throws her arms out for me. I start running and make it to her for about half a second before he ripped me away again. He had a hold of my left hand, barely, fingernails digging in, and was dragging me back out of the store. I still have little scars on the back of my hand from him. I could see my mom chasing after us screaming ""someone please help! He's got my baby! That's my little girl!"" So he throws me back in the truck and speeds out of there and heads to the back/country roads. I was bawling and he just kept asking why I did it, why did I have to mess it up. 


We finally get back to his mom's house and there were a couple of cop cars there waiting. He finally gave up, and we got to go back to our mom. 


He never got in any kind of trouble for the whole thing, besides a nationwide ban from Lowe's. Just to continue the story a little further, my mom had filed for divorce during this time. Divorce takes 60 days from filing to be complete/official. Two days before it was final and over, my dad called my mom while she was at work, saying ""please call this off. We can fix this and get through it. I love you, please,"" crying the whole time. She kept saying no, it's over. So he finally stops crying and says ""so this is how you want things?"" She said yes. ""Okay then, bitch."" 


About an hour and a half later, my mom gets another phonecall at work. This time, it's the fire department. Our house (we lived out in the country) was on fire, and no one had even seen it until the Schwan man drove by and called it in. Well by that time, it was a total loss. The fire marshall ruled it as arson, even saying it was a ""lover's fire"" or something because the fire had been started on or underneath their bed. I lost everything I ever had, minus a stuffed animal and the clothes on my back. He never got caught for that either.

"CS major here, a field where something like 30% of graduates are women. What makes the field inherently unwelcome? Every college I've ever heard of has groups and scholarships specifically for women in STEM... what incentives do you think are missing?

As a woman posted yesterday:

&gt;When I was in college, 100% of my classes were 30 women to 10 men. It wasn't just my local community college, when I went to a major university I saw the same thing. When I went to school as a child, I remember teachers and the school system specifically pushing and encouraging women to do higher education. The same support was not there for male students. I think it's great that we push for equality (since in the past, there was an imbalance in genders in college), but I feel like we have gone too far the other direction, and made things less equal.

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4266i0/toronto_man_found_not_guilty_in_twitter/cz85pgm

I mean maybe it's not fun to talk about, but what if women aren't choosing CS and other engineering/math oriented fields because the subjects aren't appealing? Like how 90% of childhood education and social welfare majors are women, we don't say ""well this is a problem because men don't have the opportunities."" What if it's the same situation here?",0

I don't know how your brother died, but say he killed himself because of depression. I've been through severe depression, I've been on the edge, and I've wrote about it online and texted people about it. Why would you want to hide that? Wouldn't reading every possible part of the lead up to the suicide, however difficult, help people learn to recognize signs and symptoms in others and themselves?

Furthermore, with the aforementioned suggestions of embarrassing stuff, maybe one would want to know what someone was getting into before whatever they died of?  

You might say ""it's none of your business"", I think though, that you can gain a lot of good, helpful information on death and how to prevent it in certain situations by doing this.

"When I was growing up, my father spent about 10 months out of the year living in Shanghai, China. The first time I went to visit him (I was 14), we flew over there together from New York. I was sitting in coach, he was sitting in business class (naturally). About half way through the flight, he came back and visited me. ""You're going to experience two different worlds here,"" he said to me, ""both of them are amazing and very different from what you're used to, but one of them you can't tell your mother about.""

In short, I saw the whole city and experienced a culture that was very different from what I was used to in New York. The ""world"" I wasn't able to tell my mother about was the fact that my father (who purchased goods from Chinese salesmen) was often taken out as a client and entertained. One night, they took us to a ""karaoke bar"" (which in Shanghai is often just a brothel). We got drunk and flirted with women, but nothing happened. I definitely got the sense that it could have if I wanted it to (my dad certainly wouldn't have stopped me), but at 14 I wasn't quite ready for that sort of thing and felt pretty torn by the moral repercussions of the situation.

My father died 2 years after that. Needless to say, he had a pretty unconventional parenting style. The jury is still out on whether or not I benefitted from it... ",2

One way of looking at odds (maybe not the best), would be to multiple the chance by the payout to get how much youd win on average.

So with chance x payout, lets use smaller numbers in this case because I don't want to use my phones calculator. Say your chance to win is 1%, and your payout is $100.

So for a normal ticket, 0.01 x $100 = $1.    
For the double ticket, 0.01 x $100 x 1.167 = $1.167.  
For two tickets, 0.01 x 2 x $100 = $2.    

So, while this is a lot of generalizing, two tickets will do you a hell of a lot more good than a double ticket.",2

"Ha. I *knew* this would pop up, and I have something that I have came up with that nobody else have said before(none that I know of).  
First, if they were successfully sent back, but Joy wouldn't be there. If they're back and Riley still can't feel good, who knows how it will affect the entire ""world"" inside her head. And that's assuming the memories actually *can* be plugged back.  

I don't think the deleted scenes would be canon anymore, and only Sadness can really do the ""tainting"". Here's the most accurate explanation I could come up with.  

After a memory had been sent back to the long term, it *can't* be returned to the HQ. Just like how the other memories in the labyrinth can only be ""replayed"", you can't really pluck it off and put it on a shelf in HQ, even if the day is far from being over and there's plenty of space on the shelves. This is further supported by Joy's behavior. She tried to get rid of the sad core memory by sending it down the long term. If it could be just summoned back, it would be only a while before it's sorted into the Long term shelves and could be just recalled by the emotions. I'm assuming the emotions can manually summon memories from the long term up in HQ. And look at how Joy was so frantic when the other happy core memories was sucked up the chute. If they could be just sent up and plugged back in HQ, she could've just waited and then recall them after a while. So we can come to the conclusion that if a memory in HQ is sent down the long term, it couldn't be plugged back in, especially the core memories. The emotions were acting like they're going to be gone forever, the core memories. Which they will be if nobody is going to deliver them personally.

"There's a place in my hometown known as the Proving Grounds, where the US Army used to test weaponry until about the end of WWII (my town is on the shore in New England and used to house radar stations and such). It's been abandoned for a long time, some of it turned into housing/etc., and is mostly just empty fields now, but a lot of the original structures are still there. There's always been rumors of creepy things happening down at the Proving Grounds, despite being in a fairly affluent town, so people tended not to go down there without a specific reason to. By creepy, I mean Satanic rituals, homeless dens, and brutal attacks on and by said homeless. To be clear, I'd never observed any homeless people in my hometown, and still haven't, but reports do occasionally make the papers of people being attacked both here and the nearby state forest.

As a teenager, I obviously didn't believe in these rumors, and one night decided to take a shortcut with my friends through the Proving Grounds. We were walking for a mile or so before one of my friends told us to be quiet, he thought he heard something. So, we get silent, and can hear the faint noise of music coming from somewhere nearby. Classical violin music. Naturally, we are curious where it's coming from, and begin looking around a bit, before finding a big drain pipe (probably 5' in diameter, tall enough for a person to go into) where the music is certainly coming from. Now that we were closer, it was clear that this wasn't being played from a speaker, but that there was somebody in the pipe playing the violin, and playing it pretty damn well I must say. 

That was more than enough for me and my buddies, we noped the fuck out after finding the drain pipe and the source of the music. I have no idea who/what we would have found at the other end, but we weren't checking that out at 2am. Never gone back to the Proving Grounds since; like I said, it's not a place you go unless you have a reason to be there.",6

"A few weeks before our final A-Level exams in Sixth Form, one of the students was trying to do some I.T. coursework when the I.T. technician kept taking control of his PC to do some updates.  He got really pissed off after the 4th or 5th time, proceeded to open Word and type ""I'm going to rape you!"".  Later that day he got called to the head's office where he was presented with a screen shot she had taken.

Another instance also happened in the I.T. suite.  Just outside the window was where the year 7 kids lined up to go into the canteen at lunch time.  Somebody was on a computer trying to do some work while a group of kids were banging on the window.  He walked over to the window and opened it to scare them, only to knock out a kid's front teeth who was standing too close to the window.

The third instance that springs to mind happened in the canteen at lunch.  A student threw a scrunched up piece of tin foil across the hall, it hit a kid in the eye, scratched his cornea and fucked up his vision for a few months.

Oh yeah, this all happened to the same guy within about two weeks.  He was told he was only allowed to come to school for exams from that point on, which was quite a sweet deal as far as I'm concerned.  A few weeks later he was awarded the most friendly student award at our leaving ceremony which had been decided a few weeks before the original rape incident, an award which he couldn't accept in person due to being banned from the school.",2

"Survival is all about the niche. Humans arose from apes, which probably already had family structures to some degree. 

Long childhood (and gestation) allows for more brain development, among other benefits. Thus allowing a species to develop some degree of empathy and kinship.

Immediate self reliance is great, but other attributes can be superior at filling a niche in the ecosystem. Obviously once human intelligence got off the ground, it rather uniquely enabled us to conquer the planet. But, much more limited mental capacity has plenty of benefits to leverage: a group can defend better than individuals against predators, can teach others, eventually gain some semblance of culture.

"Yeah the guy who installs your furnace is definitely an expert of environmental health and safety, air quality control, microbiological growth, National Sanitation Foundation codes, and not some vo tech graduate who can barely keep his size 40 elastic waist band jeans from sliding off of his hairy ass. 

Filters are different. I work with a team of technicians who swab and send for cell culture testings almost 1000 samples from filters and duct work every other week. It make the difference between 0-10 microbes entering a food product stream (stuff you put in your body, just like your furnace air), and 500,000+ unknown pathogens and fungi per 4"" x4"" of square air of duct.  I have tried hogs hair, pleated panels, MIRV 6- MIRV 13 rated filters, and they are all very very different per the hundreds of thousands of dollars in verification testing i have been part of in the last 4 years alone. 

You can't see the nasty shit that is airborne, that is what your furnace technician is basing all of his wealth of ""expertise"" on. I have also seen maintenance and sanitation technicians get fired from 50-60k/yr jobs for refusing to change filters on the set frequency or for knowingly installing the wrong filter because ""they are all the same"".  They are not, or we would not (see above) be spending 300K+ dollars per year to test and change them on a bi weekly basis.

This ""scam"" claim is the worst fucking advice i have seen on Reddit in quite awhile. 

Buy a damn MIRV 11 or MIRV 13 rated pleated panel filter. Check it and change it out when it gets dirty.  The more cloth area it has the longer it will last and the more likely it will be sized right for your system (yes it will also be more expensive).  They are like 50 bucks and it may save you or your family from developing asthma or catching pneumonia some day.

"17yrs. old, working as a lot attendant at a large Chevy dealership. Went to the beach on Sunday came in Monday totally red-lobstered, just sun burnt to the point of barely being able to walk. It was excruciating the pain I was in. So I showed up for work despite my stupidly self inflicted pain and asked if I could just please go home. No, absolutely not. What I could do my Boss said was rearrange that line of 50 cars over there right away. It was 120 degrees minimum in those cars but I did it literally screaming in pain the entire time. Then the owner showed up and whenever he graced us with his presence it was policy that his big ol' black Caddy would be fully detailed. He saw me and the pain I was in, laughed, and told me to have his car ready for him in 2hrs.. So I took that big ol' black Caddy outside to wash it, filled up a big bucket with soap, engine de-greaser, and some chemical crap that was laying around and lathered the hell out of his car with it. Then I hid the car, in the blazing sun, behind some trailers way in the back of the lot and laid down in the shade to wait. Sure enough when the 2hrs. had passed I started hearing increasingly urgent calls for me over the PA system to report immediately to the Managers office. I didn't. I walked over to take a look at my handiwork, big ol' Caddy was an absolute mess, sun baked suds residue everywhere and the paint was bubbling from the engine de-greaser and chemical crap I used. I was quite satisfied with myself. So I went and got in my car to leave. Now when you leave you have to drive right past the rear entrance to the service garage and of course standing right there is my Manager and one very pissed off Owner. I just smiled, gave them a very sun burnt middle finger, and drove home. Few days later I go in to pick up my last check, which I didn't get, and find out they found the car and were in the process of completely re-painting it and that I should expect a bill (didn't get one) and that I was extremely fortunate they were not going to press charges against me. I told them they were extremely fortunate that was all I did to it because my initial thought was to park it in the Corvette line and set it on fire and see how many of their precious Corvettes I could take out with it so next time they might want to think twice about their complete lack of empathy and who they choose to laugh at in the future.

"There was actually an American Indian (I think) tribe that believed that.
As the story goes, their god was creating the world and so he fashioned three men out of bread dough. He built an oven out of clay, a fire within, and then put the three men in the oven.

He was very excited to create man though, and so he pulled the first one out too early. Being under-cooked, it was still pale and white like the dough. Disgusted, he tossed it away and waited for the others to be ready.

After waiting a little while longer, he pulled the second out. He waited just the right amount of time for this one, and it came out a beautiful golden brown.

Unfortunately he spent so much time admiring the beauty of the second bread-man, and the third stayed in the oven too long and became blackened and burned.

I could still make $500 a week for my family for only 16hrs a week of work. So we moved out again and I went back full time.

Basically, I worked really hard, made sacrifices and chose a very affordable option. The community college was very important in all this. Those first two years of school are the same everywhere, except the top tier like Harvard or MIT. So just go wherever is cheapest. I lucked out a bit in that this particular CC has an excellent Computer Science program, so I found work before going on to a 4 year. ",1

If this song is embarrassing to both have sung to you, and to sing aloud, why do we continue to do it?

"Creepiest true story that I remember from when I was VERY young:

We had a nice old neighbour (male, probably in his seventies or early eighties) that lived across the street from us and had a big beautiful black lab. His name was Lee (fake name) and her name was Booger and she was the nicest dog ever. Well, we used to see Lee out on his porch all the time or in his yard and we would always say hi and sometimes my dad would go and have some beers with him later in the evening. Really nice guy. Anyway, came this hot summer, I mean HOT. 110 degrees for at least a month, in Michigan, that's RIDICULOUS. We didn't see Lee out on his porch or the yard for a couple of days, but we figured he was probably staying inside with the AC being as he was an older fella. We went to visit my aunt for three days after that because she was awesome AND had a pool LOL. When we came back, my dad went to visit Lee and I just remember everyone being really upset. Not just ""an old man died"" upset. My dad was puking in the grass when he came back. Even an hour later. He wouldn't talk about it, even to my mom. I know he gave a statement to the police and I remember seeing them taking Lee's dog away. I was crying because Booger was a nice dog and I wanted to keep her if Lee had died. I didn't understand what had happened at the time. It wasn't until I was older that my dad finally opened up to me about it. He was drunk when he did, he needed to get it off of his chest. He had never even told my mother (they were divorced by the time he told me). He said that he went in the house and the smell was horrible. Thick, almost oily, like you could feel it coating your mouth. He said that the first thing he noticed was the lights all being off and the flies. There were flies all over. Lee wasn't anywhere to be seen right off, so my dad looked around the house. He said that he got halfway into the hall and he heard a weird noise in the back bedroom. A repetitive noise. He said that he first thought that it was a clicking noise, but as he got closer it started to sound more *wet*. It didn't even occur to him that the dog would still be in the house. The *hungry* dog. He opened the door to the back bedroom and he said the stink hit him in the face like a ton of bricks. He almost passed out from the strength of the stench. He threw up right there in the doorway, before he even looked. Lee was in his bed, or what was left of him. His head and shoulders were intact, but he was decaying rapidly in the heat. From the chest down, dad said he was missing most of his flesh. His gut was entirely gone. The dog still had her muzzle in him and was working on a hole in his legs. He said that the dog didn't even stop or notice him. He slammed the door and booked it home. ",105

"Well said.

So, at the risk of being a *technicality ass*, my comment was in regards to whether the concept of religion is a con or not.  

Religion is a social structure created by humanity for humanity to bring order to chaos.  One hand attempts to explain the explainable via metaphor while the other imposes a system of ethics and morality on its members.  Morality and ethics were the foundation of law and order before a legal system was even created.  

And, in regard to the following:

&gt;religion encourages ignorance towards acceptance of a universe without a creator being&gt;     

A number of religions actually disagree with you.  For example, Judaism has almost always been pro-science.  It requires that current scientific knowledge and understanding be factored into Jewish law and dogma.  Judaism evolves and changes maintain relevance to the time.  It is already widely accepted that the creation myth is a metaphor for the big bang. (incidentally, the metaphor fits so well that one wonders if someone figured it out long ago and just didn't have the words and ideas necessary to adequately explain it.)

The Catholic Church also agrees with this concept.

In terms of having a negative effect on humanity, how can you even determine that?  Religion, or some form of it, has existed since before memory.  It is the particular branch that humanity took to developed and civilize itself.  I'm sure an alternative branch could have existed, but we didnt take it.  And had we, it would not have led us to existing as we do now.

How can you say religion has had a negative effect on mankind when and alternative case study so far doesn't exist?

Cheers.

As an aside, I believe life came about due to the pure luck of a particular puddle of primordial soup being struct by a particular lightning bolt.  The odds of the correct proteins existing in the puddle and that spark of electricity happening at just the right moment are astronomical.  Of course, when you scale that out to the entirety of time and space, it seems almost a certainty that it will happen.  To people believing in a creator, the luck that it happened here and now on this planet is God.  If they want to personify it, who cares?

"Wrath: Queen Boudicca. 

From TVTropes:
When Queen Boudicca's husband died, Rome decided to abandon all pretense of playing nice and annexed her kingdom. When she objected, they had her flogged and raped her daughters in front of her. Boudicca then rallied a massive army of rebel Celts and led a bloody crusade against the Romans occupying Britain. Before she was stopped, she sacked three of Britain's largest Roman cities, killing at least 70,000 civilians in the process. It required three entire Roman legions to finally bring her down.
That is, the first legion that tried it found itself outnumbered fifty to one at least, so no surprise at the result there (all the infantry were wiped out, some of the cavalry and the senior officers escaped). Boudicca's last stand, the Battle of Watling Street, saw her faced by two legions, mustering about 5% of her own numbers. It was a complete Curb-Stomp Battle, but not the way Boudicca was hoping.

"I have an interesting perspective on this I think.

25/M, been dating my fiance for nearly 8 years (been engaged 6 months). She grew up southern baptist and initially told me she wanted to wait until marriage, which I was fine with. Fast forward like 8 months, and one afternoon alone at her house, she told me she had changed her mind. 

And so began a period of about a year and a half where we would have sex anytime we got to see each other (long distance relationship, we saw each other every month or two) and let me tell you the sex was incredible. I should mention that she was my first and still my only, but I feel strongly that we would still be extremely compatible sexually even if I had more experience. 

Sometime in college (even longer distance), we broke up for about 5 months. When we finally got back together, she made it clear that she - again - wanted to wait until marriage, which I was - again - totally fine with. It's been 4 or 5 years since then, and we haven't had sex since. I've had to satisfy myself the ole fashioned way, and it doesn't harm our relationship at all. I really don't tell many people about it though because they generally don't believe me or make me the butt of some blue balls joke. 

If she wanted to have sex tonight, I would be happy to go along with it. But it's important to her that we wait, and she's important to me, and so we wait.

"I didn't stop watching sports altogether, but I did stop watching football.

I am English, so the football I am talking about is what Americans would call soccer, but I am not American so don't expect me to.

I used to watch a lot of Football. Every Saturday and Sunday I would generally watch 1 game and highlights of all the others (usually 10 matches in the top league and 12 in the second league) and I grew increasingly irate/angry/upset every time I saw a player go down without being touched, or touched very lightly, clutching his ankle like it was about to fall off. And then as soon as the ref made any sort of decision, be it a free kick or card for the ""offender"" or even to say play goes on, suddenly the pain is magically all gone and he can play on as if nothing had happened. 

This infuriated me to the point where I sacked it all in. I haven't watched football in probably 5 years now (other than a highlight clip of when some German guy got 5 goals in about 11 minutes or something batshit crazy like that) and I am, I guess, much happier? I never stayed angry for long, and I never dwelled on it, so it never impacted my life outside the few minutes where I raged and swore at the TV.

"""OHHHHH HAILEY SAID FUCKING SHIT!""

We have an old home movie of my two sisters when they were about 5 and 6. They were hanging out with my dad in a tree house and my oldest sister wanted to put a ""curse"" in the camera by lifting her pointer finger in the air. (she didn't know at that point that the middle finger was the ""curse"" finger)

My dad asked her if she knew what that meant and was trying to coax her into saying it (all for fun). She kept saying she didn't want to say it because she was worried she'd get spanked. 

Sister - ""You promise you wont spank me?""
Dad - ""Of course I promise don't you trust me?""
Sister - ""Okay daddy but it's a baaadd woooord""
Dad - ""what does it start with""
Sister - ""It starts with an ""f"" like ""fu- fu- fu-""
Dad - ""Okay I get it you don't have to tell me, its the 'f' word""
Sister - ""Yea its a bad word""

I knew I would find out soon enough.

"I never combined pain with the reaction to pain. I specifically separated my posts into two parts. Please reread them again because I don't know how to address your points without repeating myself. My first half of the post was about the actual experience of pain (qualia). My second was about recurring thoughts. I explicitly separated them.

You seem to be completely ignoring genetics. Women, for instance, are more sensitive to pain in general. Gingers are less. Do you believe this won't affect things? People who respond differently to things often do so because of different genetics. There is masochism (this entire area is extremely poorly covered - I don't recommend going here).

I don't think we should be using monks from remote regions who number in single digits as evidence of anything. I would imagine the military would employ this if it worked all that well. I mentioned earlier things that can modify the brain: surgery, experience, drugs. Being a monk is such an unusual situation that those people will have nothing in common with the rest of the world and they could have very well changed their brains. That doesn't mean it's the sort of experience anyone else wants to have: it is essentially just another form of trauma. It's like putting yourself into an empty room for years or other unusual situations. That may actually change your brain but it's not applicable to regular people and it often doesn't come for free.

You are completely ignoring my examples: chronic pain, depression, PTSD. Do you really think your approaches properly address these? Would these issues, then, not be trivial to fix by any middling health professionals? Yet PTSD persists and doesn't go away easily at all.

You don't get to promote methods by only noticing successes. You also need to note the failures. And if there are far more failures than successes, it may not be that great of a method. People talk and talk about how you can control everything, and yet nobody controls anything, people get obese, people get depressed, people commit suicide. Most people can't easily not suffer, so I'm not interested in methods that work for one guy on a hill: I want methods that work for most people. In my experience, most of these don't work, and the arguments for trying to prove that they work get more and more fantastical as the discussion progresses.

It's all nice to talk about how people just ""choose"" to suffer, how they should just do all these things and everything is fine, until you start applying it giant populations. Then suddenly you're forced to learn that regular people have their problems and a lot of these philosophies and approaches have a whole set of prerequisites that these people fail in large numbers.",1

"Ok. So you are saying it is not necessary that God's morality like up with ours. But if God's morality is subjective, then why do we care about God's morality? The survival of the human species is important to the human species. If it isn't important to God, then why should we not just tell God to take a hike? 

Imagine a father who thinks it is right to have strangers come over and fuck his child. The child feels this is wrong, and tries not to allow the sex to happen. The father is not harmed in any way by this, and he doesn't feel it is wrong. Now, initially the child lacks the power to stop the sex from happening, because he/she is weak and the adults are strong. In that moment when the child is powerless to stand up for his/her own morality, does that make his/her morality less valuable than the father's? 

Now think about God. Just because It is powerful enough to inflict It's will on us, doesn't make it right. And just because we are powerless doesn't mean our morality (or well being for that matter) is worth less. ",4

"It's likely true that everything that happens is uncontrollable. That there is no free will. That we are all subject to our circumstances. There is a cause and effect for every single atom in the universe, and there is no way for a human being to have conscious control over these causes. 

However, the absence of free will does not mean that there is fate,  destiny or predetermination. The quirky randomness of quantum physics adds a level of unpredictability and luck to everything in the universe. The macro can't effect the micro as far as we can tell, but the micro absolutely effects the macro. If the universe were to expand and retract repeatedly, you would never have the same outcome of life because of the randomness of quantum physics. Enough would be changed over time that nothing would be the same. ",2

I just know from growing up around it that a lot of people in my rural area seem to believe aboriginals face these problems because that's just how 'natives are' and are unwilling to explore the history behind how aboriginal society changed throughout Canadas history, nor are they willing to explore how our immediate economic and social opportunities inform our development and the development of communities at large.

"TL, DR: 2nd largest white ethnicity group, historical reasons, higher body of culture, insecurity/blandness of Yankee/WASP culture.

Irish-Americans constitute the 4th largest ethnic group in the USA. There are millions of us. Me, my great-grandmother was a Hays who came over during WW1. 

Add to that the fact that it was the 1st assimilated minority culture. As late as the 1960s, Irish-Americans still faced discrimination. Thus Irish Americans kept distinctive for a longer period, much like Italians and Jews. 

 Thirdly, the families: from the original red-necks fleeing Cromwell, to the Potato Famine, to the Irish Revolution and the Troubles, the Irish Americans did not come by casual choice, but out of fleeing genocide, slavery, famine, and war. Thus they remember a homeland that they were forced out of.

 Fourth, the culture: from Yeats to the present, Ireland invests and subsidizes culture and tourism heavily. Gaelic music is at the root of folk, and fused with African and Spanish rhythms also became at the basis of rock and roll music. Ireland is a beautiful country, with beautiful music, beautiful literature, beautiful women. There's a lot to envy/romanticize/nostalgicize.

 Fifth, it's overcompensation for the perceived blandness of Yankee culture, which has been anodynized by the corporate monoculture. To be true, the corporate monoculture has a large and heavy basis in Yankee culture. So lacking any feeling of tribal affiliation, many Americans gravitate to ethnic heritage. It's either that or embrace Dixie culture, but not everybody's a good ol boy/belle.

 There are Californian, Cascadian, Southwestern identities. We're working on it. But we just don't have the sheer amount of culture, enough idioms distinct for the monoculture yet.

"I have a six year old. There is no way my child could put together the steps from the keys to a death. None. You were not at fault. All I can say is that parents are not infallible; your grandparent lost their child - and they sound like they just didn't have the skills to cope with how it happened. Your father sounds the same. They probably deal with a huge amount of conflicting feelings around it. I would think that your father harbours a huge amount of guilt for putting you in a position where you had the ability to harm someone. ",2

"I am happy that transgender stories are getting coverage finally. When I was growing up, trying to understand the feelings I felt, it would have been amazing to have portrayals of trans folk in the media.  One thing many trans people struggle with in internal transphobia let alone external; struggling to accept yourself for who you are. To not think of yourself as a freak is hard to do.  And lack of understanding from people helps lead to the this sad fact that at least 40% of transgender individuals attempt suicide. Trans people have the highest murder rate by far in the LGBT community and trans people of color are the most murdered.  So it is not a safe world to be transgender. I attempted suicide 8 times over a 2 month period shortly after beginning my transition. I lost friends because of it, some of my family don't talk to me and some who do still use male pronouns and my old name. And I had a relatively easy transition.

States are still trying to (and some are succeeding) pass laws forcing trans people to use the bathroom of their birth gender. I had to use the men's bathroom at work for over a year after living as female and getting it changed both on my driver's license and birth certificate. So there is a long way to go in the way transgender people are treated by others and the law.",4

Hahaha I'm sorry but I laughed out loud when I read that,-2
"In college, I defended a friend of mine who was totally being manipulated by an ex-girlfriend of his.  He broke up with her because of the constant whining and guilt trips, so after they broke up, she kept poking around him with even *more* constant whining and guilt trips, trying to get him to come back to her.  And no one ever really *said* anything to her, because she'd start crying and playing the victim act again.  

One night we were walking back to campus from a party, and I wasn't full on plastered, but drunk enough that I didn't care.  My friend was with us, and when we left, the ex-girlfriend trotted along behind us and started up with her usual victimhood.  ""Riiiich!!! Were you just going to LEAVE me at that party and go home without me??""  Nevermind the fact that they were broken up and he hadn't brought her to the party - it was that kind of manipulation.

Anyway, I was drunk enough that I lost my temper, turned around and chased her down the street screaming at her that it was ""WAY past time for you to leave him alone, he doesn't want you anymore, he's going out with a different girl now who doesn't make him feel bad about everything, get the fuck away from him, you spoiled fucking brat, if I catch you, I'm gonna punch your face in!"", etc.   It was a small town, and it was late enough that there were really no cars around, so I must have chased her up and down about three streets before I ran back to my friends and went back to campus.  

And it worked!  She never bothered him again - she steered clear of him, and he never had to listen to anymore of her guilt trips and bullshit.

EDIT:  Sorry, I never did mention - I'm a female. I just read through this again and realized how horrible it sounds if you'd thought I was a guy, threatening to beat the shit out of some girl.  So to clarify, it would have been a cat fight.",12

Now imagine if someone said they were going to put their faith in Cthuhlu to get them through their illness. You'd feel almost obligated, as a friend, to say ""dude, Cthuhlu is fictional literature. Go to a fucking doctor!"" (Keep in mind that, to us, your religious beliefs are just as fictional/out there. This is not a loose comparison, it is a direct equivalence.)

Now, what makes some atheists assholes is when they refuse to keep their mouths shut over the little things. The example above is pretty severe, but for something as simple as ""my dad is in a better place,"" it is obnoxious to say anything unsupportive. Most of us aren't assholes. Unfortunately, you have zero clue most of us are even atheists, so you only notice the ones that are confrontational.

You'd never be able to kill anything, and you don't point a gun at something you don't intend to kill.""

Which says a lot about them both, but it's something that I keep in mind. Guns are inherently destructive, and there's no reason to even touch one if you aren't intending to destroy something. All of those other rules are important as well, arguably more important, but they come after that one in my head.",1

I'm always merciful when I review a fanfiction, if it is so unimaginably shit that they are notably bad amongst bad stories that I have to tell them how bad they are so I can explain it to myself how someone could make and publish such a complete mess. The shit in the rough, as it were. Even if they had no plot, bad dialogue, generic characters, no understanding of pacing, and worse grammar than me, I always tell them what they did right. There is always something. ""I liked the mermaid hunters mentioned in chapter 4, I feel like you could get an interesting story out of it, and I laughed at the joke at the end of chapter 8!

I decided to add the guy who bought it and see why he would buy something so over priced. I add him and it turns out it was a glitch, he was gonna buy a .10 card and somehow got mine instead.

"I live in Pennsylvania, which is just as forested as the name suggests. Here, it's the mild months that can be the worst because the wet seasons come during the spring and fall. All that wet decaying leaf matter allows molds and fungus to multiply very rapidly and is when the onset of most of my serious exacerbations happen. I actually find the freeze usually marks a period of relief as the decay is frozen over and the airborn irritants reduce. 

But yes, if it's genuinely cold and I walk outside in that for very long at all it will make my lungs feel very heavy. If it weren't for the scorpions I'd go live in the desert. But frankly I'd rather smother to death than suffer even one of those things in my house. 

If you haven't yet, make sure you're talking to your doctor about controllers. I'm always surprised how many asthmatics are just living off their albuterol! There are mild but effective inhaled cortico steroids that often work wonders for people, as well as long acting beta 2 agonists for those who are especially hard to control, like me. Also go find out if you have acid reflux. In recent years we've had something of a minor medical revolution in our understanding that reflux doesn't just exacerbate asthma, it can actually cause it! For those people, even minor acid which isn't even painful can be at the center of their asthma attacks. I know because I'm one of them. Controlling my stomach is paramount to keeping my lungs in serviceable condition. Luckily, like asthma, there's a lot of options out there now to help with that and they're a very safe class of medication. So even if you're not feeling much pain, it wouldn't hurt to bring the idea up with your doc just to have a look.

It's a layered approach, you have to find out as much about your irritants as you can so you can manage them all. It's a game of nickles and dimes. Hopefully you've got a good GP and has gone through all of this already but if not, these are the places I'd start.

"That everything I have fought for will slowly slip through my fingers and I'll lose my sense of purpose. 

To explain: I have been working on getting into the military for 3 years, I'm 20. While in high school in my sophomore and junior years I had depression. My girlfriend at the time hand told my family and they got me into a psychologist as well as some medication. Because it was written down I experimented with cutting once I was denied for ""severe depression and self mutilation"". I was told I could try again in 6 months with an evaluation from a psychologist saying I was depression free and a high functioning 'adult' but they gave me the run around for a year before they flat out told me they wouldn't send it in because it would only be a waste of time.

I didn't give up, and I have my connections. I know a lot of people who were willing to help me get in. Many of them wrote letters and one long time family friend took me to a BBQ hosted by a congressman. I met him told him my predicament and he told me who to contact. I got a hold of them and they took all my information and told me they would do their best.

It's been a while and I haven't heard much. I worry that everything I've been preparing myself for is going to be for nothing. It's been 15 years sense I decided to join the military and it's all I know. I don't know how to go back to being 'normal' it's a part of me. I will keep fighting but I am scared to death I am fighting a losing battle. If I fail I feel like I'll just fall back into the dark pit I was in back when I was still in high school. I don't want to go back. It was too hard fighting my way out just to fall back in.",1

"I was admitted to a psychological hospital in my mid 20s after being sexually assaulted.  I was nervous to be there but after a few days I started feeling more comfortable in the environment.  It wasn't a state hospital and was actually pretty nice.  I did see some crazy stuff while I was there though.  My favorite people were always the recovering addicts, they had funny stories and seemed to be a very humble bunch.  They separated everyone during the day into 2 groups.  One that had substance abuse problems along with a diagnosis and those who didn't.  My room was across from where the first group had sessions so if I missed anything of mine I often overhead what was going on in there and it seemed like the atmosphere was less uptight.  I was hospitalized for about 2 weeks and it really helped.  I was treated for PTSD and was able to learn about what it was and how to manage it.  I definitely saw things that I had never in my life seen before.  I was also surprised at how normal some people were.  I met some great people.  

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  

Edit: Forgot to mention how I am now which is pretty good.  I'm definitely a different person after what happened to me.  My life is fairly normal now, I still take something for depression but don't use anxiety medications anymore.  ",5

So my mom looked, and was amazed to see that it was this gigantic boil, big enough to leave a hole in my arm when it was drained to where you could see slightly into my arm and skin. So she took me to the doctor the next day where he instructed us to keep it bandaged, let it drain naturally and heal, keep my arm in a sling to avoid movement, and return in a few days to see how it was healing. Well, I went to gym the next day, with a doctor's note excusing my participation, along with the sling on my arm. Well, the substitute decided not to listen, and made me do push ups anyways for the rest of the hour long class, regardless of the sling. Luckily, about 10 minutes later the other gym teacher saw me (he had been informed about the condition earlier in the day), told me to stop, and let me sit at the bench every day till I was out of the sling. That teacher was pretty awesome. But I hated that substitute ever since.",2

"Will Smith. 

All the shit going on now about him from his former co star Aunt Viv is a bunch of bullshit. 

Me and a few buddies used to love Fresh Prince. So we found out where it was shot, and used to stand in line at Sunset and Gower in Hollywood in hopes to get in and be a part of the studio audience. We went every single week. At some point, Will's manager Benny Medina noticed us there all the time and told Will we were huge fans. We got a tour of the set, got to go through the clothes, sit on the set, the dressing rooms, everything. We got passes to show up any time we wanted that they were shooting to no longer have to wait in line. 

So as time goes by, Will ends up personally inviting us to his video shoot for Boom Shake the Room. Only me and one of my friends could do. We show up and Will and Jazzy Jeff were rehearsing. Everyone was extremely gracious to us and let us into their dressing room. All of their personal stuff was around. When it was time to go out to be a part of the audience for the video, Will came up to us and thanked us for being huge fans and it meant a lot to him, and he just wanted to do his part for people that were like him. As black kids in LA, this meant the world to us. He was a stand up dude, no doubt about it. No bullshit, no drama, no trying to get us to do anything. Just legitimately looking out for fellow young black kids to really have the time of their life seeing the show taped. 

A few short years later I would work at Columbia Records, where Will coincidentally was signed, and got to work on Men in Black soundtrack in promotion and saw him a few more times. I recounted the story to him and he remembered was just legit happy to see me doing well at Columbia. No fakeness from that guy. His kids may be a lil different, the Scientology shit may be strange, but all my interactions with the guy were very cool. 

ps on the show from 2nd season on you if you listen to some exaggerated laughs, that was us. When we went home and watched the show, we realized we would hear ourselves laughing. So we would go back and try and outdo ourselves laughing super loud and well after the fact. We did it so much that we actually ruined a scene. The director came out and told us they couldnt hear dialogue because of us and to quit it or else we would be kicked out lol. Needlessly to say we never did that again.

The thing is, it's not the hat itself that's to blame.

A fedora being worn by a dapper, well-dressed man - a fellow clad in a tailored suit and sporting a pocket handkerchief, maybe - is an effective accessory. It only becomes an unpleasant one when the guy wearing it weighs about fifty pounds more than he should, attempts to hide his perpetual acne beneath thin, wire-like curls of unkempt facial hair, and honestly believes that his ability to quote Japanese cartoons makes him qualified to discuss international relations. Folks of *that* variety seem to have the mistaken assumption that the hat makes the man, rather than the reverse.

After all, you don't see guitars suffering from such extreme social stigma, despite the fact that there are roughly a thousand faux-deep dimwits for every actual musician.

Finally, as you insinuated, the hat that folks picture when they hear the word ""fedora?"" That's a trilby.",963

"The thing is the kids make/want those things once they're old enough to choose between toys largely because they've been socialized that way their entire life. From the time they're born, for example, your friends and family will gift a baby girl baby dolls and barbies. A baby boy is assigned to the color blue. This is all before they're even old enough to understand the concepts behind all of this. 

Just like someone who grows up Christian will probably stay a Christian, (because that's what they've been socialized into) the same thing happens with gender.

One way you can see this is by looking at other cultures. Wearing makeup as a guy in the US is totally frowned upon, and guys here, for the most part, wouldn't even consider it. But in South Korea, the stigma is different. Men on South Korean TV advertise it and are seen as handsome, and so guys there are socialized to see it as pretty normal and often use it themselves. European guys are also more fashionable, where in the US, people throw around words like ""gay"" and ""metrosexual"" at guys who do that, socializing them away from it from before they even understand what socialization is. 

That said, there is probably some aspect of nature to this too. I would guess where this came from older times, when guys were the sole provider because they were bigger and stronger, and women the homemakers, and were selected in part for corresponding traits. We don't have the same need to base roles on strength alone in today's society, but ideas from that time have carried over, and are probably why children are treated that way from birth. And then they grow into adults who think the way they were socialized, and end up socializing the next generation of kids to act similarly. Even if you give them every toy possible, you can't stop all of society from socializing them inadvertently. ",1

"There's a lot of uncertainty about what happened to Wallenberg after his apprehension, but the short of it is:

Wallenberg was summoned by Marshall Rodion Malinovsky, a Soviet officer, to respond to allegations that he was involved in espionage. He said as he was leaving 'I'm going to see Malinovsky. I'm not sure if I am a guest or a prisoner.' (Paraphrasing.) In the early 00's, it came out that Vilmos Bohm, another Swedish diplomat and Soviet informant, had given the Soviets Wallenberg's name as someone possibly involved in espionage. For what it's worth, Wallenberg was eventually outed as someone connected to American intelligence during his time in Budapest. But I'm not clear on if it had anything to do with the Soviets. 

Everything after his arrest is mostly speculation. Some sources say he was shot not long after, others say he died of a heart attack while in prison in 1947, others acknowledge the validity of the heart attack timeline, but contend that he was poisoned or by other means assassinated and the heart attack is just the cover up. (Like, 'Oh, the prisoner was found dead in his cell. Judging by the intense, violent bludgeoning, I conclude, heart attack.' That kind of thing.) Still others say he was alive up until the 80's and died of old age.

There's not really a happy scenario to imagine-- 40 years in a Soviet prison, on charges of being a spy, couldn't have been all that preferable to death. ",25

"I'm getting in here way to late to be seen, but I'll share anyway.

I'd known her for years, we'd always gotten along, but after 8th grade she began to get really stressed all the time. Always excessively worried about her future. Now, it's fine to plan ahead, but she was killing herself over it. Everything needed to be perfect. She had to get straight A's to get into the best college. Which one? She wasn't sure. She just wanted to get to a high-end college.

On top of that she was always planning something. The worst one was a trip to, like, Greece or something. She had to raise money for the trip, so she started a GoFundMe, did some T-shirt thing, etc. She even tried to do a ""haunted forest path"" or something for Halloween. She asked a bunch of friends to help on the night she did it, but I was the only one besides her to show. Shockingly enough, no money was made.

At that point we'd lost contact for the most part. Every time she called me it sounded like she was getting over a sobbing session. She ended up getting exiled from her mom and step-dad's place (I heard it was over an argument about how she was never grateful for anything, which was rather true), and was living with her grandparents a good while away from me. That was about 4 months ago.

TL;DR - She second-hand stressed me out of my mind, and we lost contact. I don't mind that she's gone.",1

"Not actually a job, but still a commitment. In 4th grade, everyone in our grade was offered a place in the elementary school concert band. It was an opportunity to learn how to play instruments since the band teacher in our school would manage purchasing the instruments and teach us how to play.

I was really excited, my older brother, who had already been in the band for 1 year, was playing his saxophone at a level my 4th grade musical ability could appreciate. So I decided to learn to play the trumpet because I wanted to be all cool playing all the trumpet-things I saw on television. But from day 1, I was having difficulty learning how to blow into the mouth piece of the instrument. The music teacher gave us sheets for us to record how much we practice, but whenever he came around to look at mine, he told me they were all lies because I still couldn't play well. He said that if I was really practicing for all the amounts of time that I wrote down, then I should be at least as good as everyone else. So I locked myself up in my parents room (because it's the only room with a lock in our house) and I continued to practice until my cheeks were sore. Little did I know while I was practicing, that I wasn't even playing the instrument right; there's a particular sound you have to make when blowing into the mouthpiece which I never really got a good grip on until later. At school, my band teacher continued to lecture me on the importance of practicing as well as yell how the band doesn't need me. That even if all the trumpet instrumentalists quit, he wouldn't care. So by the end of the year, I was in fact the last trumpet player in our band, not because he was mean to everyone else, I think they were all busy or couldn't fully commit. So I told my parents that I'd like to quit, even through my dad's lecture on the importance of following up on commitments, I convinced them to sign the sheet permitting me to quit. And the next day, I handed it in and the band teacher was all ""Are you sure you're quitting? The band could really need you! You're the last trumpet player here!"" I just gave him the sheet, dropped of the trumpet, and left.

In retrospect, I guess this wasn't all that glorious, but just spiteful.

tl;dr - Joined the band to learn how to play a trumpet, teacher told me he didn't need bad trumpet players, so I quit.",1

"From a quick google search, atheist is defined as ""a person who disbelieves or lacks belief in the existence of God or gods."" 

The lacks belief version is coming increasingly common, and I think that's the one tripping you up. You're sticking to the older less inclusive one. Imo it seems more rational and logical to go with the literal and structural understanding of the word. In that case (a)gnostic addresses knowledge and a(theist) addresses belief. It's a pretty powerful and simple classification system.

The analogy everyone uses is if I put a jar of marbles in front of you and said ""Do you believe that there are an odd number of marbles in this jar"" your answer of ""no"" would not mean that you believe that there are an even amount of marbles in the jar. You just lack sufficient knowledge to say either way. If there were a ""odd number of marbles"" belief system called oddmarbledist, you'd be A-oddmarbledist, which says nothing other than you don't have a positive belief that there are an odd number of marbles. Atheist of the inclusive variety says nothing other than you don't have a positive belief that there is a god or gods.

However, my husband has a mother who is basically using him for cash. I've had to put my foot down- unless it's an absolute emergency, we are giving nothing to her. I don't care if she's in a third world country situation, we will be in a situation just as bad if we send money. She literally has no other relationship with him other than money. In years, they haven't talked, she gets her grandchild fix from facebook, and she's seen me once through Skype. Then she uses relatives to try and guilt my husband.

I've never even met face to face, but I've lost all respect for his family. He comes from a culture in which parents expect to be supported, but I've seen how that works in functional families and it also involves lots of love from the parent end, the guilt is kept to a minimum, and in a weird way it all works out. Our situation? No.

Thing is, I feel if I say anything it will be seen as an attack on mommy, so I'm hoping that my husband wakes up on his own. Living on a tight budget can easily clarify things for some people.

But seriously, screw my MIL. She wants to mooch money, but doesn't seem to give a shit about her son. Coming from a shitty family myself, it's sad to see that my husband will eventually go through some of the emotions I did.

"I work as a lifeguard during the summer on a local beach that receives quite a bit of traffic each year (like up to like 5000 on a really nice day and that's only in the legal parking spaces)and there were three guards that worked there that were not the sharpest tools in the shed. Two of them were twins and they had been working for a year but the other one was a rookie.  So anyway one of the twins and the rookie, we'll call the twin Bill and the rookie Bob, were both on post together which was a great deal of oversight on the chief guards' part.  So they were both on post when a kid probably 10 years old in the water starts screaming at the top of his lungs that he needs help, this is so loud that the senior guards that are in the first Aid station behind the post Bob and Bill are on hear the kid, the guards to either side of the post fully expect a rescue to happen so they all call in to announce that they are shifting down the beach to cover the area while Bob and Bill go in.  The only problem is that both Bob and Bill are not going in.  So the guards on the posts next to them have to go in and immediately everyone knows that Bob and Bill fucked up as this is called over the radio.  The two guards should have been fired and I'm very suprised they werent.  My boss later justified putting them both on the same post together saying that if they were both as good as half a guard then putting both of them on post together would make it a whole guard... Such was not the case. There are several other good stories about both Bob and Bill but this is the worst one I know about them and they totally should have been fired.",2

If we go by whether or not the brain has a specific receptor, then some senses are out and others are in.  That would leave out some obvious senses like time and give us three different pain senses.  Personally I don't think there is a perfect way to define it, so the debate will never have a legitimate conclusion.

It reminds me of the Ship of Theseus paradox.  To me it is less of a philosophical debate and more of a semantic one.  It really comes down to how we define a boat, and that we don't have a word for incrementally changing boats.  If we did, then there would be no paradox.",2

"This is probably the worst advice in the thread.

Psychopaths don't live pleasant lives; they don't think long-term, they don't improve their skills, they don't form lasting relationships, and they frequently don't seek out the help that they need.

I know a lot of people think of psychopaths as being charming, intelligent, manipulative, and amoral, but a lot of the time, they're more like Dennis from IASIP. They're deluded into thinking that they're intelligent and charming, when they're actually just arrogant. They think that they're manipulative, but they often just steal or essentially beg for what they need at that moment.

On top of that, there's a high rate of comorbidity with Cluster B personality disorders. While psychopaths may be cool and collected during social situations where they are trying to get something out of somebody, they're also highly dramatic, angry, and depressed. They don't meticulously plan murders or thefts, they lash out at people impulsively. They might also be inclined towards impulsive suicidal behaviour.

The main thing to remember is that psychopaths frequently have less self-awareness than the average person. Their narcissistic attitudes aren't conducive for self-reflection, and because they rarely see anything wrong with their immoral actions, they rarely alter their behaviour when confronted. This is a great way to get quickly booted out of every social group you enter and potentially end up with your legs broken in the alley behind a bar where you tried to steal the wrong person's beer.

Basically, being a psychopath will almost 100% make your life far worse than it already is.",7

2nd, running and workout also do some help, but not working now because it's -10 degrees outside and winds blowing. so i try to keep myself busy to prevent from getting depressed.

3rd, talking and hanging out with positive people is a great way to make me feel much better. i never talked about my depression to those people. just talking other stuffs, they think i'm normal. chatting really helps, but i don't expect others to know me or i can find a cure or receive any compassion from others. me just trying to be normal and making friends. because no one want a trouble friend really.

and all other ways can help me get through my depression, temporally. yes, only temporally. medicine had time, and i can't always run, friends had their own time and i have to hide my secrets. 

so i never really beat my depression. it's hard, really really hard. most of the time i am lonely and i try to find something to do like watching movies etc. 

i think about suicide a lot. but there are many other beautiful things i have in my life. so it's pretty much like yin and yang, light and dark. I don't know how long i can last, me being like this for over 16yrs. but i am still alive and had some happiness.

"I was once arrested for weed.  We weren't smoking, but we were sitting down at a common town spot overlooking the water, just about ready to get blazed.  I was working crazy hours at the time, and on this particular winter afternoon I was out of work while the sun was still out.  On the ride to the shore, I actually told my buddy, ""these are the fattest, most perfect joints I've ever rolled.  If we don't get ripped, we need to stop smoking for awhile.""

We get to the spot, waiting for our other two friends to pull up and join us in the car.  Before we know it, there's a silver jeep liberty pinned us into the corner, and two plain clothes officers at each window.  We weren't smoking, but they saw a baggie in the center console, assumed it was weed, and intimidated our then feeble minds into admitting and handing it over.  They searched our bags, searched the car, and finally found the two joins I had stashed in a pack of smokes under my seat.  I'll never forget how upset I was.  Not because we were being detained, but because I just wanted to get high and relax, and they were taking this moment from me.

I'm not sure what came over me, but while I had my hands on the car, I start arguing with the cop.  **""What the fuck man, I'm not bothering anybody, I just fucking got out of work.  All I wanted was to smoke weed and watch the fucking sunset.""**  The cop says nothing back to me, but just gives me this look like I'm the dumbest fuck while also the most endearing 'criminal' he's ever seen.  He then proceeds to tell me, ""kid, just shut the fuck up.""  We're released, and I watch every 'know your rights video' for two months that exists on the internet. 

A few months later, after laywers and multiple court visits, I forgot a final visit to follow up on the ACOD or some shit.  To this day I'm unsure of why I had to return to the court.  I'm living in city at the time, so my mother calls me one early morning, ""Charlls, there are three officers here to pick you up, what the fuck.""  So she gives me the cellphone of one of the officers, who tells me to come out of the city, and meet him at my parents house the next morning.  He tells me he'll fast track me to the court, I'll be in and out, no big deal.

So the next morning, I get in his car and we start driving up the street.  He lets me sit in the front, which I think is cool, and everything's going to be gravy.  Well two minutes into the drive, he pulls over, and tells me to get out.  ""I have to put you in cuffs, I just didn't want to do it in front of your family.  Also, get in the back.""

Now I'm arrested, in a holding cell at the local county jail.  There's fucking degenerates everywhere.  THREE HOURS in a cold jail cell before they load us, chained together, into a cold windowless dark school bus.  We proceed to sit behind the courthouse waiting to be allowed in, where we're then stripped searched and loaded into the courthouse jail. 

Now this whole time, I'm remembering that my good friend's father is a court officer.  I'm praying that he won't see me in this condition.  I was so fucking embarrassed.  I'm in a holding cell with 20 other dudes.  Two brothers next two me are in there for robbing a pharmacy at gunpoint, and resisting arrest.  Another for possession of 3 POUNDS of oxycontin.  The point is, I'm surrounded by dudes getting real time, and I look like I don't belong.

My friends dad walks by the jail cell with his coffee, clearly just getting into work.  He does a double take, makes eye contact with me, and without hesitation says aloud 'WE NEED TO MOVE THIS ONE'.  Every hard ass dude in the holding cell looks at me like I'm a psychopath murderer.  He puts me in a corner cell up the block, hands me a cellphone through the bars, and says ""I don't care why you're here, just call your mom, tell her to show up in courtroom ABC, and I'll make sure you're first in front of the judge.""

Welp, an hour later we're in the courtroom.  Now every delinquent arrested either the night before or that morning is sitting, waiting for their turn.  I can tell they're all curious as to why the fuck I needed to be isolated.  My friend's dad is standing next to the judge, trying not to look at me, knowing how fucking ridiculous I feel. 

The judge calls me up.  ""Charlls Doe, at 3:45pm on January 18th, you were arrested for criminal possession. You were quoted as saying, I JUST WANTED TO SMOKE WEED AND WATCH THE SUNSET, how do you plead?""

I swear to god every single person in that courtroom started laughing.  Including the judge. ",39

"So I can get why some people find NYC overwhelming, but I fucking thrived on it. Even just tiny things like moving to DC and walking home from the bars at 2 AM and getting caught off guard by ""what the fuck do you mean I can't pick up a six pack right now, let alone a Gatorade?"" drove me up the wall. I kept forgetting that I couldn't just assume that I had to plan ahead instead of just dealing with it at the end of the night. 

So I won't claim to *get* it, but I understand on an intellectual level that not everyone views stuff like the 24 hour aspect of NYC the way I do. I can respect people like you who'd rather live comfortably in Tennessee. The only thing that really gets me going is when people like you living in Tennessee get all indignant at the idea that some people genuinely like NYC. 

I can see the benefits of places like Tennessee but at the end of the day, you're making a conscious choice that part of what you're ""paying"" to live in NYC is potentially having to hear your upstairs neighbor walking around. Just because you couldn't deal with that doesn't mean that some people aren't happy to deal with it if it means getting to live in NYC. ",1

Work piles up and piles up. I became this big ball of stress and anxiety just thinking about it, but I still didn't do anything. I felt like everything was too far gone to try to fix it.

Her only drug was alcohol itself. She was around large groups of people most of the time so it would have been really hard for her to cheat. Plus, I would have found out as I was cool with everyone at the restaurant, and when someone does something in the restaurant biz, everyone and their mother knows about it. 

&gt; What made her change?

I'm far from perfect. I have my flaws. Hell, I cheated on her! But I graduated college, I'm driven, she says I'm intelligent, she says I'm the kindest man she's ever met, she knows I'm smart with my money and overall, I'm a decently well put together adult in her eyes. I think she kind of realized she cannot be reckless and keep a (healthy) relationship with a decent person.

You see, she's hard headed. It's what got her in trouble in the first place, but it is also what helped her move forward to becoming a better person than I could have ever imagined. She knows what she wants, and she'll do what it takes to get that. If not going out to the bar every night means there's a chance you might marry / have kids with the person that she loves the most (me), she's willing to leave all the alcohol in the world behind for me.",1

I'm not trying to undercut the reality of what you and people you know or anyone at all has ever been through, because it is very upsetting and horrible. But to know that even the people being put through it still have happiness about the good things in life just reminds me how even though a lot of humans personally suck, humanity itself is not so definitively torn down.

"By separate and unique, I mean to address the fact that philosophers and otherwise tend to think of human consciousness as ""that extra ingredient"" that separates us *higher order beings* from the rest of the cold and unfeeling universe. I disagree with this view to the extent that I find the idea of there being something special to our experience suspiciously self-centered. That is, we're treating our ""subjective experience"" as an indicator for more than just complex thought. We experience, perceive, etc. things, and we are smart enough to contemplate that fact; there isn't much to it in my mind. I'm sure if a computer could think as freely as we can, and could contemplate its own experiences, it would be just as confounded. The problem is, it's hard to take a third-person point of view on the matter seeing as how we're discussing a phenomenon that only occurs on a strictly personal level. Consciousness, I think, is just the label we've given to the sum of our personal experiences and to what constitutes reality *for each of us.* It is therefor, hard to talk about it as if it isn't unique *to us.* But I see no exceptionally strange phenomenon here. I don't see any reason to believe consciousness is anything more than what results from complex perception as viewed from the perceive's perspective. ",1

'Rights' (or 'privileges' if you prefer) are not static, they are dynamic.

"I think what he might mean is that, assuming time and our space continues existing infinitely, that we would be reborn again.

So because time would infinitely continue, that means an infinite number of ways all of the fundamental particles in our universe will come to be. So because all possible combinations of particles will exist, inevitably the exact combination that makes our consciousness (whatever that may really be) will arrange and form again.

Then because we can't experience time while our consciousness is gone, for our 'sense of time', we would have effectively died in the present, then reborn 'instantly' sometime in the infinite future.",8

"Before sophomore year of high school, I loved reading. I read anything I could get my hands on, at least a book a weekend. Sophomore year came around and we had to get exposed to classical literature and slog through a book for weeks. I think we overanalyzed one book to death for an entire month.

After a while, I ended up getting Monarch Notes (cheaper than Cliff's Notes) and not even reading the books. This persisted through Junior year. I think that year I didn't read a single book. Senior year, we were assigned **Brave New World**. The book was assigned on a Friday. I picked up the Monarch Notes that night, started reading them and got about three pages through the summarized version when I put it down and read the book. I had other homework preventing me from finishing it Saturday, but I was done by lunch on Sunday.

What happens on a Monday when you read the entire book after being assigned to read only the first chapter? You get in trouble, that's what. ""Write a paragraph in your journal for every page you read."" Ugh.

Same here. I don't think most of Lovecraft's work would translate all that well to film, but I think ATMoM is the exception to that. It could make a fantastic film.

I'm not sure if this is true or just one of those pop-culture urban legends, but I've heard that Del Toro wasn't able to make a film of *At the Mountains of Madness* because the executives balked at the fact that there's no love story in the film.

To me, that's just dumb. It's a horror film. Does sci-fi horror really *need* a superfluous romantic subplot? *The Thing* didn't have one. *Alien* didn't have one.

So many films have a love subplot they don't *need.* It seems to be in the interest of audience inclusion. For whatever reason, film executives have it in their heads that women can't be interested in a movie unless there's some kind of romantic angle. Not every story needs to be a love story.",1

This is the part that I regret most: sincerely believing that I was helping people and being a good person while I was actually helping them destroy their lives and their futures, and them listening to me because my sincerity and confidence won them over.

Being self-aware is a fundamental requirement to being functional as someone diagnosed with something like Bipolar I - once you have that, it's not impossible to manage symptoms or keep problematic behaviors in check.  Once you know you have a Bipolar I diagnosis, you learn to inspect your motivations and actions for a basis in reality - if you're not self-aware, you miss this step, and that's how problems form.",2

2. Terminator 2 is a retelling of the original movie, just with a bigger budget and a mid-movie role reversal.  If you'd never seen the commercials for it, and if you didn't know ahead of time, the scene in the shopping mall back hallway when the T-800 and the T-1000 meet would have been a complete mind-blower that totally changes the direction of the film and completely counters your expectation of the movie up to that point.",2

"**Tirion Fordring**. He's a ""hero"" of the Second War, paragon of the light, and an inspiration to many paladins. He's also a massive, arrogant, self-righteous douchebag who caused the unnecessary deaths of many who served under him.  I'm sorry for the incoming rant, but it roasts me when I think about how many Warcraft fans praise him for being one of the best characters out there.

Instead of gathering champions of the Horde and Alliance in a secure location to formulate plans and properly train them for the final confrontation with Arthas....he throws a goddamn **jousting tournament** out in the open, right smack dab in the Lich King's frosty front-yard of Icecrown ( Nevermind that they're beset on all sides by fanatic cultists and scores of undead ). 

If that weren't idiotic enough, after everyone's smacked themselves around with lances for a while, he decides to pit the best fighters both factions have to offer not just against the deadliest creatures in Northrend, but at one point against *each other*—to the death. This all culminates with a long-winded speech about how only if the Alliance and Horde come together can they hope to defeat the Lich King. Newsflash: You just had one faction group slaughter the other because of a big misunderstanding on Varian's part. Then lo and behold, Arthas himself pops up in the midst of all this and [this gem of an exchange happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW7VjpglECc).

Even at the citadel, Tirion goes charging in at the start of the fight like an idiot, gets frozen in a block of ice, and we're left to do most of the battling for him ( I know he eventually breaks free and saves us, but it was stupid of him to get himself trapped in the first place. Years of experience and he can't even dodge a snowball ).

"This is kinda long, so apologies up front.

Number of years ago, a friend of mine with impossibly bad dating skills got married. Partially celebrating, partially thinking the system had somehow been gamed, with access to a designated driver, I drank everything at his reception's open bar. Not beer, not wine. Mixed drinks and cocktails like I was a slightly higher class dock worker.

Five hours of dancing and wobbling around and doing my best impression of a man shipwrecked in a vodka and orange juice sea, we're leaving and my bladder just took the ""planet"" classification away from Pluto. I figured I could hold it, and I figured wrong. I had to pester my buddy driving to find the nearest gas station NOW.

So I stagger on into this place, and it's deserted. I loudly ask for the can, and a voice in the back directs me to an ""Over here!"" Which turned out to be the only guy working there this night on his hands and knees, with the door propped open by two bottles of windshield washer fluid, giving the john the scrubbing of a lifetime. You wish your potty was ever this clean. Everything twinkled like starlight and it was cleaner than any doctor's office or kitchen prep area I had ever seen. He tells me he's ""juuuuust finishing uuuuuuup..."" and I can wait there for a moment.

For a bit of background, I had to wonder what this poor guy was thinking. I'm a six foot hulking, beer-bellied brute of Scottish decent who just wandered from a formal event. I didn't have a suit or money for a rental, but I did have a kilt in my family's tartan. Not only do I resemble Shrek, I'm dressing like him too. So there's me, this simpering linebacker, wearing what looks like a cheerleader's skirt with a single, small saddlebag for my balls and breath that could disinfect a surgery ward, standing cross-legged in the doorway. For ten minutes. While this poor man vents his OCD styled cleaning skills with a literal toothbrush.

Ten minutes. My eyes are floating at this point and I can no longer guarantee it's sweat coming out of my pores.

He finally stands up, dusts his hands with agonizing slowness and cheerfully says, ""All yours, chief!"" I thanked him as he sauntered out with the same tortoise-inspired speed....then viciously kicked both washer fluid bottles out of the doorway and locked it. 

This is where things get dark, folks. I'm sure many women on here can complain for endless stretches about the ordeal of relieving oneself when trussed up in expensive formal wear, especially heavy skirts or dresses. The delicate art of positioning oneself over the porcelain without really touching it, of skillfully bunching up the dress or skirt so it does not trail anywhere unseemly, and the precise maneuvers required to accidentally-ah, *accident* on yourself.

Now try that standing up. With your weighty purse (sporran) around your waist as a secondary belt that hangs in inappropriate places. Now go for the hat trick and combine all that with being too drunk to fish and possessing anatomy that requires hands to aim.

With one hand holding my hemline, and the other propping me against the wall, I maybe got a few fluid ounces into that sparkling clean bowl. To my unending shame, the capacity to will myself better line of sight or coordination failed miserably, and I was in no condition so cease the flow. At the end, when I finally managed to purge what felt like a solid three gallons, the unforgivable had been realized. There was so much pee on the floor, shuffling my feet made quiet *splish-splish* noises. In a panic, I pulled the light switch from the wall so the poor attendant working there couldn't see what happened. I don't know, drunk logic. I booked it out of there fast as my tottering legs would let me, and I haven't returned.

The guilt that I destroyed that poor bastard's hours of hard work with a lot of irresponsible drinking and poor aim was way too much for me to shoulder. This happened in a part of town I frequent often, and I cannot bring myself to go back there.

**TL;DR** had to pee really bad, made a menial wage slave's job that much more menial, and I uh...""cried"" him a river.",2

"Oh yeah, lazy assholes get those things too. My ex coworker decided to put too much chewing tobacco in his mouth at once and had a mild heart attack at 32. He went on disability for a few months then made an arrangement with the company where he'd permanently work from home, get his internet and cell phone paid for, and be able to take PTO pretty much whenever he wanted. After a few months of that he got laid off (the product he worked on was discontinued). His severance was better than everyone else's. He kept his insurance for a year, got to keep his cell phone and company discount on his monthly bill...all the while collecting unemployment. 

The thing was, he was totally fine after his heart attack. He didn't quit dipping or smoking, he didn't quit eating horribly or drinking heavily. He didn't have a new lease on life. He treated everyone like shit and used his ""condition"" as an excuse to slack off. I called him on it once and got a stern talking to by HR.

&gt; You are a racist, privileged, ignorant piece of shit. The world would be better off without you.

I'm not racist.  Not by a long shot.  I want people to succeed, regardless of any superficial grouping. But more importantly, I want them to have the actual ability to succeed, not just one that looks good on paper and makes me feel warm inside saying ""I agree with this"".  I want the one that actually works, which affirmative action has proved time and time again that it doesn't.  It breeds failure and contempt.

I'm not ignorant.  I'm basing my opinion off of what actually has been happening.  People accepted through affirmative action are NOT succeeding.  They're failing out, getting fired, or stagnating because they lack the skills to move up in a job, or finish a college education.  They were accepted because of their race and not their qualifications. 

Lastly, I'm DEFINITELY not privileged.  Want to see my college degree?  Oh wait, I can't show you that.  I don't have one.  I couldn't afford it.

For 6 bucks someone shops for me, and I save an hour or two a week, plus gas/parking, and they do a more efficient job than I do, saving me money in the long run.",30

"Spider bite on the dick.

This was my worst fear, and IT ACTUALLY FUCKING HAPPENED.

I was sleeping over at my girlfriend's place. I believe(d) that spiders are bros, helping with the killing of nasty flying gnats. So I usually leave them be, and give them names.

Let's call this spider-bro ""Richard"", since you know how this story ends. But for now, Richard minds his business, so we don't mind his.

We both like sleeping naked together. Bad idea. I'm usually sleeping against her ass, so unconcious boners happen frequently.

I wake up with an itchy boner... just in time to see a spider-bro crawling away down the edge of the bed.

It was Richard. What a dick.

I think nothing of it at the time, assuming it mere coincidence. I scratch my dick. I fall back asleep.

The rest of the night passes. I wake up with A MOTHERFUCKING HUGE BUMP ON THE MOST SENSITIVE PART OF MY DICK, just under the mushroom.

I touch it.

Electric signals. Sharp. Agony.

My girl sees it. She mentions it looks just like her spider bite. That bastard Richard. Does his villainy have no limit?

She wants to treat me. I refuse. It hurts to touch. Better to buy cream.

She explains. Richard ain't poisonous brown a brown recluse spider. He just hurts like hell. Best way to end the pain is to treat it by popping it and letting it drain. Otherwise I'm looking at days of this shit. I finally agree to man up and let her treat it.

On a scale of ""1"" to ""Battlefield Amputations"", the pain before treating it is a 6/10. Except every time I walk, the fabric of my pants brushes against it, causing a 7/10 pain for a split second. Enough to make a child cry, or a grown man let out a sudden grunt in pain.

She attempts to pop Richard's bite, fucking bastard he is.

Pain shot up to a 10/10. I'm serious, Reddit. This was the worst pain I have ever experienced. Worse than when i got my leg sliced open. Worse than the time i suffered the wasp attack. Only trumped possibly by if I could bear children without medicine.

I'm screaming. Literally screaming. My heart is trying to jump out my chest and it's making good effort. 

""MY DICK! OH MY GOD! STOP! I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE!""

""Nadante! Shut up and let me work on you! You need this, trust me.""

Her neighbors probably thought it was the best sex ever.

She finished, and I wasn't able to have sex for a while.

That, my friends, is my greatest fear. It happening twice. I read about it now. Obsess over it.

**Spoilers Ahead!**

I'm not usually one for stealth based games (only ones I've ever finished were Hitman: Blood Money, Dishonored and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory), but this game made me learn to really appreciate well done stealth mechanics. By the time you play as Ellie I was getting through virtually every area without direct confrontation. I had a few slip ups, but most of the time I recovered fine and was able to throw them off my trail. I had gotten to a point where I was avoiding combat all together if given the option (mostly areas with infected).

The 'puzzles' got on my nerves a bit, but never so much that it significantly effected my experience with the game.

I also really like how they decided to end the story. It showed that a story doesn't have to have a Hollywood ending to be great. They constantly presented you with the harsh truth of Joel's personality. He was a good man who lost his daughter to something stupid just as the proverbial apocalypse was beginning. He was a man who never recovered from that. He became hardened and willing to do whatever it took to survive. Things like being a hunter and involving himself in the weapons trade, among other things. He even turned his back on his own brother when asked to do the right thing and survive by natural abd moral means (which would eventually come to fruition in the form of the hydroelectric power plant). The game fools you into thinking Ellie is able to soften his heart (which she does to a certain extent) when in reality, Joel never really comes around. He cares about himself, Ellie and Tommy (to an extent), and that's pretty much it. He was willing to take away a possible world cure simply because Ellie was the only thing left he genuinely cared about. He even half-lied (or completely lied depending on whether or not you found a few contextual items) to Ellie so as not to lose her. Twice.

I can't say enough good things about that game. Truly an experience I won't soon forget.

And he has a history of sexual deviant behavior  (not the rape charge, I'm talking about the indecency charge from before that which I'm not convinced was fabricated.) He also ran the accuser's car (deputy's wife) into the ditch and pointed a rifle at her. How convenient they haven't reminded us of that since early in the first episode.

"This is not meant to be a troll response but a genuine one intent upon understanding. If child abuse is so rampant why don't they just abolish the age limit (or maybe lower the universal age of consent to 14 or so) and treat unwanted sexual contact as abuse regardless of whether the victim is 5 or 55?

I say this as a 22-year-old woman who began dating her husband at 16. He was 26 at the time. We met when we were respectively 15 and 25. Technically we were flirting (okay, *I* was flirting) at 15 and 25 but we didn't make our relationship official until I was 16 and was ""technically"" legal. A lot of people tried to say that I was being abused and my husband was a pedophile. I don't think that's at all the case. (and even if he were attracted to teenagers, the only reason I'd care is that I'd have to contend with younger, more attractive girls!)

I don't advocate abuse in any relationship, underage or not. However, the majority of the things you mentioned (middle aged women drooling on pictures of teenage boys, teen porn, the legality countdowns, schoolgirl fetishes, etc.) don't look to me like abuse. Why does age matter so much? They say I at 16 was too young to consent to a relationship with an adult, but here we are at 22 and 32, married for four perfectly blissful years, so obviously we knew what we wanted.",15

Why is this a thing? Every time my daughter cries now, my mother remarks that it must be because she isn't being fed tea.

Everyone I know who had kids cca 20 years ago is totally taken aback that I don't give her tea. It might be beneficial, it might not be, doctors say it's fine to just breastfeed, and actually advised me to be careful with teas in the first few months, because I could do more harm than good to the baby.

"You can apply the BITE model to anything if you want to.  That doesn't mean it's a correct, or even an honest comparison.  

The BITE model refers to undue influence, and for cults this is within a RELIGIOUS setting.  You can show me lots of areas where undue influence is practiced.  But undue influence doesn't make the military a cult, it just mean's a high control organization.

Furthermore in a school you might have undue influence, sure.  But your eternal future and love of your family isn't dependent upon following everything correctly in your school.

This is a serious thread.  People's lives are consistently ruined by these two religions.  Please don't call for respect in one post and then compare the damage JWs, for instance, do to the public school system. ",3

Sometimes they have this thing called empathy. Or sometimes they have an actual, personal stake in things.

No, what I mean when I'm posting about the tragedy is ""Holy shit, Scott, go to a doctor, saying 'I'm pretty sure I didn't get a concussion' isn't good enough when you were close enough that you still can't hear out of your left ear.""

**Movies**

*In the Loop

*In Bruges

Both are dark comedies which suits my taste but definitely worth watching.

**Documentaries**

*The Battered Bastards of Baseball

*Somm

*Baseball by Ken Burns

The Battered Bastards of Baseball is great even if you aren't a fan of the sport, it's more of a story about a group of rejects banding together to say fuck the system while inspiring a city.  Somm is really interesting, it's about wine Sommeliers.  It has a lot of information about wine and the process of becoming a master sommelier.  Ken Burns' Baseball is no longer on Netflix but might be on Amazon.  Once again it requires no prior knowledge of the sport and like all Ken Burns documentaries it is exhaustingly thorough.

**TV Shows**

*The Office

Yes, I'm a pilot and already working in the industry. MANY pilots think stall = low airspeed. I'm trying to make the point of not falling for that trap. So instead of saying stall = angle of attack along with low airspeed. I'm saying stall = angle of attack @ ANY airspeed.

My explanation is long because I was writing for people with no experience. I spent a few paragraphs defining angle of attack. In your eyes that may be drivel. But for someone who's never heard the term, may find it useful.

You're probably a student studying aerodynamics, to which may know more theoretical knowledge. You can design a wing better than I can. But all you have are theoretical knowledge. Wait until you graduate and gain some experience before getting all pissy.

We were all over 21 and drinking on our property so the cops couldn't nail us for that, but a drunk driver hit a cab in front of our house that was stopping to get a hot dog and all of a sudden the police had an interest in us.  Being high as hell I for some reason decided I should be the one to talk to them, so they issued me the citation after telling me what sort of horrible trouble we could get in selling hot dogs to unsuspecting freshmen.

Then I went to court and they'd fucked up all the info on the citation so the judge told me to not worry about it but if I ever wanted to sell hot dogs again to get a license.",55

When I showed up at the city hall/fire department/community center/police department/food bank, the chief saw me walk in, went over to the safe, pulled out my wallet and handed it to me.

It all started out great, the manager was great, he was assembling a new teams of 6 sales reps and I instantly felt at home...Until the owner relocated my manager to the other side of the states to a different store right before christmas time and instead put in the general manager in his stead. The GM was the biggest dick head on earth, worst fucking breath I've ever smelled and would walk around bickering about the most mundane things: ""stop leaning on the counter, don't sit on the chair by the register, bla bla bla"" I knew that I couldn't walk out before christmas season was over as I would lose too much money by not selling during that time so I stuck it out with the shithead GM until January 15th 2010, which was a friday. I showed up two and a half hours late wearing jeans and a Tshirt (I had told my old manager all about it and he was hyped). On my way there I kept imagining how I was going to tell him ""GO FUCK YOURSELF YOU FUCKING PENIS PIMPLE"" and what not, I get there..He hasn't showed up..I give HQ a call and he's there...

"At this point this comment will undoubtedly get buried, but here it is. 

I worked for a small computer shop for a fucking crazy woman. The owner was her husband - super chill, very smart - but clearly did not wear the pants in the relationship. She made unreasonable demands on the techs. Things like the fact that we were only paid for the JOBS we did, but she demanded that we be at the office from 8-5 daily to wait for the jobs. Unpaid. 

She started getting crazier, doing things like emailing at 3AM for updates on customers and blowing up the phone if you didn't respond within like 20 minutes. My wife and I had just had our second child, and it got to the point where I had to sleep in the living room because the phone kept waking up the baby. 

Anyway, I knew things were getting ridiculous when she started ""not getting paperwork"" for some jobs I did, even though I kept a written log along with photocopies of the papers for when they were done and when I turned them in, and wouldn't pay me for them. I would even offer her the copy I had made, but she would say she had to have the original because I might have added hours for more pay. I told her I had given them to her, showed her the logs I kept, and she called me a liar. 

I started looking and immediately got an interview, then a second, for a much better company. One day, she sent me an email saying I wouldn't be paid for any of my jobs that week as an ""incentive to start becoming more organized"". I gathered my things, drive to the office, and proceeded to RAGE QUIT. I stood in the lobby, gave my things to the receptionist, and told her I needed to talk to my boss. She called her, and the receptionist told me she "" wasn't available "". I stood in the lobby, customers waiting and everything, and went off. Let everyone in earshot know in no uncertain terms that the manager was ruining my life and stealing money. When I went to leave, the receptionist (who never did anything but defend the woman because she was some life long friend who got WELL paid to do nothing) said I needed to leave any work related papers there because they were company property. I opened my binder, tore out every piece of well organized paper for every job I had ever done there, and made it fucking rain. Paper everywhere. I then walked out and yelled "" TELL THAT CUNT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NOT PAY ME FOR THIS BULLSHIT, MAYBE THIS IS ORGANIZED ENOUGH FOR HER"". 

I got in my car, pulled out of the parking lot, and got a call on the way home. It was the company I had interviewed with. They offered me a job, asking when I could start. I told them that, coincidentally, I was free the following Monday. 

Never got paid for those jobs. Didn't care. Ended up making twice as much.

"We lived in our house for 7 years. NEVER had an insect problem aside from the occasional spider or teeny tiny ants. Finally put the house on the market in September, between the first few showings we started seeing a large number of worms. Not two weeks later the moths appeared. I couldn't believe how many we had. we filled up a good 6 of those sticky triangle moth traps. Another god send was an electric fly swatter because it was so gratifying to see them spark up. I think what finally finished them off was spray bombing all the affected areas. I guess we were lucky because the house was empty so there really wasn't anywhere for them to hide. I did a few rounds of that a week apart. As far as I know we left the house moth-free, but who knows if there were any eggs laying around, and what the current status of them is now....

And yes, we had to throw out ALL our food, and whatever we bought afterwards we kept in the fridge and freezer. I think the source of the moths was some old wheatgrass seeds I used as chicken fodder stored in the basement directly below the kitchen.",3

"It really looks like we're on two different topics or you're equating them for some reason.  I eat meat but hate animal cruelty on all levels.  I cannot be sure how the cow was raised and slaughtered no matter what the provider tells me.  I hope we can eventually be done with medical testing on animals as most can be tested with modern technological simulations.  I think that cosmetic testing should be illegal.  Koreans that eat dogs are not worse people than me and Indians who treat cows as divine are not better than me.  
And I do get to decide which ones are ""worth more"".  My dog and cat are loved members of my family.  I will not eat them.  I will not judge someone in another culture who does.  I love animals.  If I had a pet cow I would not eat it but would continue eating beef.  I do get it to decide which animals I eat and which animals to love and cherish. And by definition that makes me a hypocrite and I don't care.  I will continue to judge someone on how they treat animals regardless of whether they eat meat or not.

Maury himself was only out when the camera was rolling, the second it flipped off he looked like he absolutely hated his life and went to the back. 

Also I'm pretty sure at least 1 of the couples on the show are actors, while the rest are real. The last couple we saw was yelling at the end, when she was in the back and she was just bawling, even after the cameras weren't on her, so it makes me think that it's real. We got served pizza after. It was a cool experience. Oh! And they film the intro and outro to the show at the end, so Maury knows what to say. 8/10 would go see Maury again. ",35

"I can see that - eggs look rather perfectly manufactured.

What is more amazing to me is the number of adults who don't know that chickens will lay eggs regularly even without the presence of a rooster (I have only hens).  And when that is explained (usually by comparing the egg laying biology roughly to a woman's cycle), they almost invariably ask whether I ever let any of the eggs hatch into chicks.

I then have to explain that the eggs are only fertile if there's a rooster about, and I always get super blank looks. I think they're trying to figure out if I'm punking them by seeming to suggest that roosters have some magical property to impart fertility to hens' eggs.

I finally have to just say: ""fertile eggs come out after the chickens have sex, and since my hens have never even seen a rooster, they are all virgins.""  I have literally had this conversation a dozen times.",1

"Numbers are not symbols; they are mathematical concepts.

Symbols can stand for numbers.

Measurements are numbers that represent something that can be observed and quantified.

So symbols are a kind of adapter that can be used to manipulate concepts at the interface of the concrete and the conceptual.

So RGB intensity is a concept at the interface between a measurement quantity (a number) and its physical realizations.  One of those physical realizations could be a pattern of illuminated pixels, but another could be a pattern of magnetic domains pointing in certain directions on a disk drive, or higher and lower voltage levels in RAM.

Your computer is a physical device that can symbolically map between different physical realizations of these measurements.  Your mind is also capable of doing things like this, in concert with your body and tools like pen and paper.

Which leads to this question:  How is mind possible?  How can we think?  How did minds come to exist?",2

"I'm gonna rant here, bear with me. This is what i'd like to see. 

- Many drugs, but not all, not only decriminalized for possession and consumption, but also readily available OTC and affordable. I'd include cocaine, heroin, LSD (which does have a medical use,) many prescription drugs like Xanax and Oxycodone. Basically the common stuff. Regulate it like Sudafed, with the database that cuts you off after x amount of purchases. I believe this will cut down on much of the illegal activity addicts ""need"" to raise money for their habit. Eventually, people will still run out of money to buy stuff from a pharmacy.

- This would leave out things with zero drug value, such as bath salts, K2, krokodil, etc. Those remain illegal, because there's really no point for using them if the ""good stuff"" is already available, and i'm comfortable saying those in particular are inherently dangerous and can't be used responsibly.

- Now, amp up the penalties for crimes related to drugs. Make drug use an aggravating factor in robbery/burglary, etc. An extra incentive for people to keep their habits in check.

Ultimately, something i'd love to see is a reduction in needle use. I was recently told by a police lieutenant in my town that needle use in the area is declining, it's becoming harder to get them, because many diabetics are switching to a ""pump"" for insulin, rather than needles. I have no clue what any of this means, as i'm not diabetic and don't know anyone who is. However, based solely on my personal experience, i've known plenty of ""hard"" drug users who could have a weekend getting FUBAR and then walk away, and go back to work during the week, but i've never seen someone use needles even just once and walk away that easily. How do we solve this? I dunno, i'm still working on that part.

These are my thoughts.

TL;DR: Make most commonly-abused drugs legal, OTC, easily accessible and affordable with regulation similar to PSE, keep designer drugs and research chemicals illegal, as this would make them mostly obsolete. Increase penalties for drug-related crime, as it is now much more indicative of an individual problem under this new system.",2

"Sorry, but I just don't see it.  Home Equity Loans always have a higher rate of interest than a mortgage:

[Home Equity Loans](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/home-equity/current-interest-rates.aspx) - Currently 4.5% for 50K

[Mortgage Loan](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/current-interest-rates.aspx) - 30 year refi - 3.74%, 15 year - 2.90%

If your mortgage is &gt; 2.90%, then refinance it into a lower interest mortgage and pay it off quicker.  There's no need to take out an additional line of credit to pay off another line of credit! 

That's how people get in trouble and lose their homes.  I would be very, very careful about following this advice.

Edit: There may be some circumstances where a Home Equity Loan has lower interest than a mortgage, and the cost to refinance makes the Home Equity Loan a better deal.  I would just make sure you do your homework and are aware of the risks involved.",8

"Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up
to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but
rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the
water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound.

Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly
toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond
and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond
and chipped the ball onto the green.

The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over
the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a
truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a
shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out
onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way
to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a
lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped
up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an
eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over
the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which
bounced right into the cup for a hole in one.

"Maybe you should learn some History before offering to answer questions about the Middle East.

The British made a deal with both the Arabs and both the Jews. Prominising them both a home country in Palestine. After WWI, the British betrayed them, they were furthermore smart enough to play the Arabs and Jews against each other. There was no alliance between the British and the Jews, if you would know the history, then you would have read about the many Jewish attacks against British targets.

The Zionists wanted their land, some land, they didn't steal anything. Give me one case before 1948 where the Jews stole land from Arabs. They never did, they bought it, and made it arable. The swamps of the North near Lake Tiberias were uninhabited at the moment, no Arab lived their, till the Jews came and made it liveble. Whole deserts have been irrigated, there were no Arabs there, so don't try to bs anyone here.

Zionists don't subject their Beliefs on the World, they fled from persecution and worse, they wanted a land of their own, they didn't care about sharing it with other for example Arabs, this was very much possible. The Arabs at some point chose to fight the Jews. And the Arabs lost.

If you say that all Zionists have to be killed, then you are not a single bit better then ISIS, you are in that case the prime example of why peace is still far away. Ask almost and Israeli and he will chose peace over war, but when we ask you a Palestinian, then it is app still abouting killing Jews, you didn't grow up, you never tried to make your own country.

And in this case ofc I think the original question about Israel has been answered a lot with your simple ignorant remarks.",4

My first consultation (never been to this office before) with the oral surgeon, I'm sitting in one of the exam rooms and all of a sudden a huge commotion starts in the room next to mine.  And I mean you can hear all sorts of shit crashing and banging, and this girl just starts flat out screaming in terror.  Someone in that room keeps repeating ""CALM DOWN ASHLEY! IT'S OKAY, YOU'RE OKAY!"" This obviously wasn't helping as loud crashes (of what I assume are equipment and tools being flung everywhere) continued and I hear at least 4 or 5 nurses/assistants running down the hallway.

Apparently this girl was waking up from anesthesia and had no idea what the hell was going on, but I had no idea of this at the time and assumed the doctor was butchering this poor girls mouth.  I looked at my mother and asked her if this was really the best oral surgeon in the area.

They finally got her under control as she came more out of it, and I got a really great implant!

Edit: I also apparently metabolize anesthetics very quickly as I woke up twice during my implant surgery.  The first time was when they were wrenching (or whatever the do) the implant into my skull.  It didn't hurt, but I remember feeling immense amount of pressure, and tried to push the tool out with my tongue, to which the doctor was like ""oh shit, I think he's awake, give him some more"", and I went back out.

  I then awoke the second time to a camera in my face, apparently I have exceptionally deep roots and they were documenting them.  I asked them if I could get a copy of the pictures to Facebook, to which the doctor replied ""god damnit, he's awake again?!""  I never got those pictures... ",2

"About Voldemort's upbringing, it was horrible. He was born on New Year's eve, 1926 in a London Orphanage. His mother had barely any energy left after her miserable life (Merope Gaunt had been physically and psychologically abused by her father her entire life. From a young age, she loved Tom Riddle, a rich man who hated her family. When she was a teenager, her father and brother were arrested, so shed seized her chance. Merope married the man she loved, and ran far far away. However, Tom left her when she became pregnant, and poor Merope had no family, no home, no money, no job, she was about to be a single mother, and on top of that, she wasn't even 20 years old. Merope's last act on this earth was to get to an orphanage where her son would be raised. She died on the night of his birth, aged 19. If that's not a tragedy, than I don't know what is). Tom was put in a muggle orphanage from the day he was born. When he was 2 years old, the Stock Market crashed. Imagine being a toddler in an orphanage during the Great Depression. I find it hard to imagine something more awful. I always thought Tom's early magic uses were to protect himself from bullies. I mean, no 10 year old that I've ever known has purposefully terrorized other children to the extend Voldemort did for no reason.

So by the time Voldemort had been born, his father had left him, and his mother was on her deathbed. Shortly after he was born, the greatest global economic collapse in history began. Tom probably was also bullied and mistreated by other children. Harry's upbringing was nightmarish, abusive, and frankly like something you'd read about in a Charles Dickens novel, but he sounds about as privileged as Donald Trump when you compare his childhood to The Dark Lord's.",1

The Catholic Church doesn't like contraception, many Christians despise abortion but accept contraception, and then there are many pro-choicers from all backgrounds. Who gets to make the rules?

No ideology should be allowed to decide the abortion 
laws or the Planned Parenthood funding. The choice should be available at a reasonable price so that people can decide for themselves, and the limits of abortion should be something almost everyone can agree on. This is how the Founding Fathers treated religion -- there should be a true freedom to choose, and the limits of religion are mostly agreed upon (no human sacrifices allowed, for example).

2. Home defense. The Police are intently a reactionary force, I'm proactive about home defense. Everyone in my home of reasonable age knows the appropriate home defense procedure:

a. If someone breaks into the home, you run into the closet and lock the doors the behind you. 

b. Dial 911 and hide, tell the 911 operator whats happening and that you are armed and prepared to defend yourself but only IF required.

c. Get the rifle and ensure it is loaded.

d. If someone tries to break down the bedroom door you yell and scream as loud as you can that the police are on the way, you are armed, and you will defend yourself if they persist. If they identify themselves as police then ask them to slip their ID under the door.

e. If they persist and break the door down then you shoot them at center mass until you run out of ammo. 

f. When you run out of ammo, you drop the gun and go outside and knock on the neighbors door and wait for the police to arrive. Don't disturb the scene. Expect to be arrested. Its better than being raped or dead. Don't talk to the police until you have legal counsel present.

After the first drink it is like a switch is flipped and I need to consume as much as possible and fast despite telling myself "" I'll drink responsibly tonight and just have a couple of beers"". 

I have put alcohol ahead of friends and family and it has damaged relationships in the past. I know I need to do this, I have been thinking this since Monday morning where yet again I woke up feeling terrible from a hangover and then felt even worse when I remembered I had lied to loved ones the night before about how much I had actually drunk (no, I didn't fool them btw). 

You words have come at a good time for me, its the reminder I needed. I am scared of what to do on the weekends and how to socialise with people at parties or family gatherings, these are things I would always drink at...and get drunk at. I am scared I wont have fun as silly as that sounds.",3

I am pointing this out not because I think it's important to you -- we Americans on average place very little value on equity -- but because equity is probably the main reason that Europeans/Australians/Canadians are mentioning them as good aspects of their country...because health care and education are equally accessible for all residents (with a minor caveat on Canada's education) since they are free. So, saying that great health care and education *exists* in the US isn't actually a response to that. 

To preempt, ""it's not free"" in case we're going there -- I think they are well aware they pay higher taxes, but the numbers on this show that they also pay WAY less than us for health care on average, when compared to insurance premiums and all the associated costs.

I'm wandering around and I'm amazed at how many people line up for hours to mingle with mostly minor celebrities. (Oh you played a supporting role in the one show that I never got around to watching? Yeah lemme wait for an hour and pay forty bucks for a pic and autograph.) Anyways, I'm just wandering around and I come across Adam West sitting alone at a table. Most celebs usually have an assistant, but if he had one, they weren't there at the time. There was no line, and I can't really say he had a booth, just more of a table. I didn't want to go up and bother him, but he looked really bored, and it's Adam fucking West. I didn't want an autograph or anything. I almost feel weird paying for stuff like that, maybe I'm old fashioned or just not used to the idea of how that stuff works. Anyways, I go up to him and make some lighthearted statement about when his shift ends or something like that. He seems to be pleased with the interaction, so I get a bit more comfortable while trying not to talk the guy's ear off. 

We talk about how he got involved with Family Guy and if he thought that Seth MacFarlane had a recurring role in mind for him from the beginning, and a little bit about how camp and TV was looked at back in the Batman days.

Any liberal that actually believes he's stupid needs to watch his old late 80s interviews where he essentially says everything he does now but in a more mature nuanced way. Also I hate far leftists and sjws, and Trump makes them really mad, so even if I didn't support his policies I'd support him over Shillary. Trump is the centrist candidate, and the only republican that believes in universal health care. Every proposal he's made has been reasonable, except perhaps the Mexico paying for the USA's border.

"Essentially the members of a state, say Mississippi, all vote. Candidate A wins 51% of the vote, candidate B wins 49% of the vote. 

Now, what has happened, is those people have elected Mississippi's 6 electoral representatives (Every state has a number based on population and their senate seats). Those 6 people, along with every other state's electors vote for president. Because Candidate A won Mississippi, he doesn't just get 51% of the electors to support him, he gets all of them, so the state of Mississippi, despite a near even split, uses all of its votes to support Candidate A. So theoretically, a candidate could lose by like .1% in a huge state with like 56 electoral votes while only needing one more to win, and still lose, because despite the fact that almost half that state's population wanted candidate B, the state votes as a whole and supports candidate A with all its votes.

"Oh jesus 9 days?

Thats quite a lot. Heres a few tips

1. dont waste all your time at the beach. Seriously if you spend 9 days going to the beach and then going back to the hotel then you might as well redo your reservation to 2 days. 

2. You might have already made the error of reserving 9 days at the same hotel, but in case you havent, I really suggest you only spend 3 days in cancun, then go down to playa del carmen for 3 days. For the last 3 days you can actually go visit Chichen Itza, and the town of valladolid. Hands down valladolid is one of the most beautiful towns ive ever been to. Its such a fun little town, the people are extremely kind. Its the only place in Mexico that I know of where the police actually help you. If youre male, dont forget to pick up a Guayabera. Its a special dress shirt that is very unique to the region. You can get it in a variety of  beautiful patterns and colors. Women can buy some extremely beautiful dresses that are handmade. You can also visit Tulum. If youre feeling extra adventurous, go to Merida. Its pretty far away, but this is the central hub of the Yucatan peninsula. A very beautiful city as well.

3. I know it seems like im explaining everything as if though you should avoid the main tourist area of Cancun. I simply just want to warn you that everything is very expensive, but you should still explore. At night the beachside of Cancun is fantastic. There is a variety of famous dance clubs that you can visit. It doesnt matter if you cant dance, just get out and move! But dont spend all your time on the beach side! Go explore the city of Cancun as well as Isla Mujeres. The only thing I dont recommend are all the water parks. I mean... theres a bunch of waterparks in the US. Trust me, theyre not very different.

4. Playa Del Carmen is quite special as well because you can travel to the island of cozumel as well. Also, the ocean in Playa del Carmen is not as violent as Cancun, so its much better to go to relax. Remember that often times its better to enter into a small private paid beach than go to the public beach. Some beaches only charge you for vehicle entry. Another cool thing about Playa Del Carmen is that there is a lot of Cenotes nearby. Cenotes are basically inland pools that were made by underground water. Some of them are super cool as you can go through tunnels where the water flows and go through a maze. Definitely check that out

5. When exploring cities dont forget theres also cool old buildings you can check out! Theres usually a lot of beautiful churches wherever you go. Just dont forget to remove your hat when you enter!

6. Visiting the ancient city of Chichen Itza can be an entire whole day event if you want to explore the whole thing. You can just go look at the main pyramid if you dont want to be there the whole day, but the whole city is worth taking a look. Just ignore all the vendors trying to sell you stuff lol.

7. something I saw a lot of people do by accident was trying out food. Please be aware that just like any other country, every region of Mexico has its own specialty foods. I saw so many people ordering food like arrachera, when really that food is a specialty of Monterrey, not the Yucatan. Dont be afraid to ask what is the special dishes of the region.

8. Dont drive. Just trust me. Take the bus or combis. Youre not prepared for the driving unless you grew up in some equally hectic place like india. Just trust me on this. 

Theres a lot more, but that should get you started!",2

I felt betrayed and so disrespected that she would do that because I had only ever been there for her. (I also had a boyfriend at the time so it made no sense). That's when I completely gave up on her and decided it wasn't my job to be there for someone who didn't value anyone's friendship. They've broken up now and I don't really blame him for what happened. It was ultimately her decision in the end. ",1

And know how to stop violence? At least stop more than gun control will? Make our education system ( and no i'm not talking about Uncle Bernie's ""MAKE COLLEGE FREE"" idea) less shitty. Make sure kids in Alabama get as good of an education as kids in New York. 

Most violent crime AND suicide is committed by young males 16-25 years old. Most of those men are from poorer educated backgrounds. Either they dropped out, or did poorly. If you kept them in school longer by actually helping them out, violence would drop. As would suicide. As would numerous other issues.

Crime is directly linked to poverty and education. Education would be an easier and more fair thing to reform. Why? Because it attacks the root of the problem and doesn't try to devalue our rights as americans. ",1

The way i think about commercial beer is that it's like fast food. You have your McDonalds, Subway, KFC etc. It's mass produced, will taste the same every time, is readily available and will hit the spot when you're hungry. Nothing fancy about it, it does exactly what it's designed to do. 

There is a time and a place for fast food and there is a time and a place for when you want a fancy restaurant. Likewise when it comes to beer. Sometimes you just want something cold that gets you drunk. Other times you want to taste an array of different flavours and styles. ",1

"You could try. Lawmakers often do try. They're generally pretty terrible at it though. The Affordable Care Act is a good example. There's now a mandate that employers have to provide healthcare for employees. It's a stupid mandate in the first place, but we'll leave that aside for the moment. Knowing full well that not all businesses are equal, and that large businesses would be better able to handle the mandate, they made an exemption for businesses under 50 employees. So if your business has 49 employees, but isn't very labor intensive and makes $1 billion/year with a 90% profit margin, you don't have to provide insurance for your employees, but if you have 51 employees with your labor intensive business that still hasn't turned a profit...

Maybe we can start electing people that not only don't pass bad policies, but can also effectively provide those policies with much needed flexibility, but I don't really see that happening in my lifetime.

Look at [ghettos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California) or the practice of [Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California). Black people, specifically, are being persecuted against much more than other people.

'Black lives matter only' isn't implied in anyway and even you admitted you can't prove it. According to a lot of people in power however, white lives tend to matter more then black lives and this is what BLM addresses.

"A few of my close friends and I had the bright idea to trip ass on psilocybin mushrooms one summer afternoon while my buddy's mom was gone all weekend (she was widowed, so we had the house to ourselves). 

Skip forward half an hour. Scene: five 18 year old boys, fully clothed, almost peaking from a quarter ounce of mushrooms, melting into the hot tub and enjoying the warm sunshine and trees gently swaying in the breeze. 

All of a sudden, it became very cloudy and the wind picked up tremendously. Since we were high as balls, we just sank lower into the hot tub. Hard, cold rain began to pummel us, and the tornado siren wailed over the downpour. One of my buddies spotted an actual funnel cloud spinning above the treeline, and we started freaking the hell out. 

We shot out of the tub and made it into the basement, which made things a lot worse. The cold, clammy basement was a huge change from the outdoor sun. In addition, my close friend's father passed away in a tragic accident only a month or two prior, and the family pictures and memorabilia made the basement feel like a crypt. 

The wind picked up to a roar, and rain was blasting the side of the house. We were trying to watch the local news to see the weather report, but we were tripping balls so hard no one could change the channel before the power shorted out. Some of us got frantic texts or calls from our parents or loved ones, asking whether or not we found shelter. 

I ended up huddling under a blanket, in a total bewildering state of panic, paranoia, and fear, as the vortex went by. My life literally was flashing before my eyes, and I thought I heard some of my close deceased speak to me. 

Some time later (several hours later) I realized I was covered in sweat, alone, in the basement. The storm was long over and I just kind of...came back to my senses, like a flip of a switch. It was a hell of a night at the point. 

Tl;dr: Tripped balls on mushrooms, tornado came, we were high as fuck and genuinely convinced we were goners. Check the forecast before you trip, kids!

"Still a freshman but I've learned so much that I wish I'd known before.

1. Orientation was bullshit, they didn't tell me anything useful. Just some of the Uni's PC propaganda.

2. GO TO CLASS. It sounds easy but it really isn't

3. Read the syllabuses, all of them.

4. The first couple days of classes are some of the most important. This is the time where syllabuses are gone over, and other details are disclosed about the class.

5. Eat healthy and exercise regularly. You don't have your parents telling you to eat your greens anymore. It's up to you.

6. Come early for the first couple of classes. Some of them assign seats on the first or second day, so you want to be in a good spot when they do.

7. Once you get past the excitement of day 1 and 2, you might all of a sudden feel very depressed from homesickness. Push through, by week 3 or even 2 you'll love college.

8. Keep in touch with your family.

9. Don't have enough time to go back to your dorm between classes? Don't take that as an excuse to play on your phone because you are ""waiting for the next class"". Bring some material to study!

10. GET A SLEEP SCHEDULE. Started trying to get ready for bed at 10PM. It sounds crazy, but now I can wake up earlier and still be rested. Those few hours before my first class are some of my most productive.

11. Take this with a grain of salt because it depends on how well you learn: They say you need to spend twice as much time every week studying than you spend in class. This is a little overkill. So long as you study well, you don't need to spend hours on end.

12. The most important thing: What will get you through college is not smarts, it is TIME MANAGEMENT. No longer are your teachers and mommy going to schedule your day for you and help dust you off when you fall. Time to grow up and get ready for the working world. The only person that has your back now is YOU! If you schedule your day, use a planner for your due dates, and NEVER do anything last minute, you will be WAY ahead of all of your classmates.

EDIT 13. Start money management!",3

"We're not really trained to do it. Guys aren't supposed to vent. We're supposed to brood, then drink, then repress everything and pretend nothing is wrong. So when someone vents at you it's like this totally foreign dimension of weirdness and we have no idea how to navigate it. 

And yeah, no, we totally worry just as much, but we're trained from a young age to repress, repress, repress, show no weakness, hide all injuries, and never let on that we're actually *feeling* anything.

If that's deeply ingrained it can take a lot to un-learn it. Personally? I had to actually read in an article about how when women vent most of the time they want support and affirmation that someone else cares and sympathizes with their problem. Having figured that out it took me a year or to to stop trying to *fix* the problem and start accepting that ""yeah, that sucks, but I totally support you and think you're awesome and stuff"". 

It really is just one of many questions in this thread that boils down to: The Patriarchy.

It's all this shit that guys are trained not to do - Don't show emotion. Don't seem weak. Don't complain. Don't admit failure. Don't ever act like a woman. Not knowing how to listen to someone and support them and reassure them is one of those things we're trained not to do. Like, can you imagine some dude being like ""Oh hey I had such a shit day at work and that dick in accounting was after me and then my feet hurt all day"" and so forth and so on without his buddies being like ""quit your bitching pussy!"" I mean, seriously, think about the slang for complaining. ""Bitching"". Acting like a bitch. That word *means* so much, and says so much about how men are taught to think about complaining or venting. It's a ""bitch"" thing to do and doing it makes you a ""bitch"", and god forbid any dude does anything that feminizes them. 

So there it is. Guys don't know how to listening because both complaining and listening are things women do, and dudes are trained not to act like women. Instead we're trained to either fix problems or, if they can't be fixed, repress them, repress any associated emotions, and pretend nothing is wrong. It's a huge problem and it's pretty much exactly why so many more dudes than chicks commit suicide - We've got all the same emotional problems but we're not allowed to talk about them and we're not allowed to comfort each other of one of us does break ranks and talk about them.

"Root canal. I was in Navy boot camp. I went to the dentist and he said I needed a root canal. He prepped the tooth, put in a temporary filling, and told me to come back in a week. That entire week, I was in so much pain, but you tell that to your RDC and they tell you to not be a baby. I go to the dentist (different guy) a week later and he asked how I was feeling. I tell him I'm in a lot of pain and he thinks that's weird. He numbs me and starts to remove the temporary filling and says ""whoa you're bleeding like a stuck pig."" He cleaned it up and continued with the root canal and when he inserted the first file, he noticed that I was clinging to the arms of the chair for dear life. He asks if I'm alright and I say ""no it hurts like hell."" He then gives me a shot directly in the nerve. Worst pain ever, but it only lasted a millisecond. Since that pain subsided rather quickly, we both think I'm fine and he continues the root canal. He stops again when he notices I am still gripping the arms of the chair as if I want to rip them off and beat him with them. He says ""wow you can still feel that huh?"" I mumble something incoherent and he gives me another shot directly in the nerve. Give it a few minutes to numb and he goes back to work. He stops when he notices I'm still gripping the arms of the chair with everything I've got. He says ""sorry man but whoever prepped this thing didn't seal it properly and air has been hitting the nerve all week. The entire area is inflamed and there is absolutely nothing I can do for you. You are going to feel every bit of this root canal."" I wanted to find that first dentist and rip every one of his teeth out.

"Every Industry is more and less shady than people think. I think this is because most people tend to settle down in one and assume their Industry is the exception.

I've worked fast food, retail, IT, healthcare, and the military. In every one, people think they or the Industry/Institution they are in are the exception, whether it is an exception in a good or bad way depends on their personal opinions/experiences.

Everyone does little favors for regulars or people they like. Everyone has a bad day and has zero pity on some customer that on another day you would bend over backwards for. The price of everything is more than it could be if you bought it wholesale. The price of everything is cheaper if the customer is a big company buying it wholesale. If they are not a regular customer they are shocked at the price. The price is not the same as it was in 1970, this is outrageous. Their nephew could do a much better job in a weekend for $5. This manager has no leadership skills and is on a power trip, that manager is just here for a paycheck but is good at his job and the other one is way to intense about it. Dave is an asshole.

"I worked at a dollar store when I was in high school. Nothing special really. The employees were all decent people, and even the manager was good on a personal level. On a business level though he could be fairly frustrating. He was good at guilt tripping you if you had to take a sick day, or if someone called in and you couldn't be there that evening to cover it.

I had worked there for 2 years part-time, and was applying for college soon. I was always polite to customers, cleaned, priced, organized, etc. I went to work, and I worked.

About 2 weeks before Christmas, the manager calls me and says ""I'm not giving you any hours for this week. You just don't really seem *into* the job lately. Your enthusiasm is down. So I'll call you next week and let you know what your hours will be then.""

Now, I'm not sure how enthusiastic a person is supposed to be about working at a dollar store. I got along with the other employees and most of the customers were pretty nice to me. Taking away that weeks hours before Christmas, when I still had to buy gifts for family, was a HUGE dick move to me. So I thought it over and waited for his call the next week.

When he did call, he started listing off the hours and I interrupted him. ""Hey, so I was thinking. You're right. I'm not really into it. I'd rather you didn't give me anymore hours. Have a happy Christmas.""

Managed to stretch out my savings and got a sweet factory job a couple months later before college. That dollar store had to close 6 months after I quit. Not once have I missed working there.",1

The concept is that the truths of what I say is true, except you dont want to accept it.

See the thing is, YOU ALREADY KNEW IM RIGHT. Thats why you resort to these childish attempts to rebel.

But I KNOW.

I know that it was difficult...

But I knew from the past 5 comments that I made that youve already seen the truth, but still find it hard to swallow.

But deep down, I know, its hard for people like you to admit.

But its over now, I ALREADY GAVE MY TRUTHS AND YOUVE SWALLOWED EVERY BIT OF IT, RIGHT DOWN TO THE BONE.

"So a while back I had seen an inspiring post online and decided I wanted to try something similar. I had seen pictures of a 14 year old kid who had come and done a station visit recently. He is wheelchair bound do to Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I asked his father if he would want to run in a race with me. I had never run a race before, but I was able to borrow a generic racing wheel chair from a local organization. After some back and forth we ran our first 5k. 
He said he had fun so I suggested doing another race. After the second race his dad told me he complained about the comfort level of the chair (never in front of me). I decided to do a fundraising campaign to raise $1500 for a three wheeled race chair of his own. Two weeks later we had his new chair just in time for our third race. His dad started running with us in that race too, he would run with the boys service dog while I ran the boy in the chair. 
It's three years later now, he just turned 17 in August and we finished our 30th race in December, mostly 10k's an occasional 5k and two relay half marathons. I am his counselor when he goes to his special needs camp in the summer (schedule permitting), I bathe him and help him use the restroom as well as participate in fun activities and encourage him to ask a girl to the end of camp dance. This week is as much for the parents as the kids. When they pick them up at the end of the week, I have never seen his dad so well rested.
He has since outgrown the original chair, it has become a safety issue. He weighs 190lbs now and is to tall for it. We wanted to get him a top of the line custom built race chair. $5000. I started a gofundme and this morning his dad came and picked up a check for $3800. I had hoped to raise the full $5000, but with fees and the $1000 I donated to a family from camp with a broken down wheelchair Van, we came up a little short. 
The boy, his father and sister have become part of my life. He texts me about insecurities with girls at school. I go to watch the Super Bowl at his house. Birthday dinner and power soccer tournaments. This started out as me feeling like a wanted to do something charitable. But calling this charity would be an insult to the relationships that have been formed. I often think that the pendulum has started to shift and I'm starting to get more out of this relationship than he does. In the end, I'm glad I saw that post online and I never would have guessed it would lead to where it has. I'm glad it did.",1

This is due to the increase in pressure and the fact that ice is less dense than liquid water (water is densest at 4 degrees Celsius, but freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, assuming 1 atm pressure). So, when you increase the pressure over an area of ice, it becomes denser and its state turns back to liquid.  (It's also why ice skate blades are an upside-down U shape. Less area touching the ice = more weight pushing on that small area = more pressure on that area = the better you can skate.)",1

US News &amp; World Report is your friend. 90% of the time, your ""best fit"" is the highest ranked public university in your state that you can get into. Sometimes there are differences because of scholarships and specific programs or you're super rich and can pay full freight at a private school, but in general. WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT DO: go to the school you fall in love with. People give high schoolers that advice all the time. ""You should take a tour of the campus and only consider it if you instantly fall in love!!"" No, fuck that. This is a very expensive investment and it really matters for the rest of your life as far as employment. You will fall in love with the physical campus eventually. Or maybe you won't, but that's ok.

"I've read enough of the bible to know that ""god"" contradicts himself on a number of of different issues, and the fact that the bible is easy to interpret in a number of different ways depending on what one wishes to read into it only makes it all the more unreliable. I've read some of the koran too, although not enough to give me any sort of authority to say what it does and doesn't claim. however, perhaps you can cast some light on this question which has been bothering me for a long time now: if you say that the only thing god can't do is lie (weird caveat to give himself, since he made the rules up) how come he tells adam and eve they will surely die if they eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil?? because they clearly don't. one of the 10 commandments is not to lie. so is god breaking one of the 10 commandments?

wait a minute though, the 10 commandments? which 10 commandments? theres actually 2 versions of the 10 commandments, so it makes it a bit difficult to choose which one to go with. which one is the correct one do you think? in the story, ""god"" gave moses the tablets written with the laws that should govern the Israelites, which moses broke, so god gave him a spare set. whats weird is that ""god"" changed the 10 commandments between first and second set of tablets. why'd he do that? wasn't he sure the first time? was he redoing them after moses broke them, and then he realised the first ones were shit and he needed to rewrite them? weird thing for an omnipotent deity to do. you'd think some perfect being like him would get it right the first time. 

and one more point about the 10 commandments, its commonly written ""thou shall not kill"" but there were many occasions god commands the Israelites to kill, for example take the nation of Canaan, which god said the Israelites should invade. He commanded them to kill all the men, and take over their land and women. conquest, genocide and rape? doesn't seem to be in keeping with his rule book does it? i could go on, but the bible is just full of holes and contradictions like this. i don't need to read the koran to know that the bible is a load of crap, muslims could just as easily cherry pick weird contradictions as i have done. 

you're talking out of your ass.

The T-Rex specimens we have, date from 66-68 million years ago.  

So basically, we're saying that there is a period of 80 million years in between them, where we haven't found any stegosaurus.  

Even if the estimates are off by several million years, there is still a huge gap.

"When I was little my brother used to hurt me and pick on me badly (he didn't stop when we grew up, but things got more violent and lots of bad things happened. I'm not gonna be talking about that stuff on here). He would threaten me and talk about wanting to hurt me and if I ever told my parents about it they would say it takes two to fight and so on. 

Possibly the two most damaging events were one time when my dad finally snapped when my brother was picking on me and basically tried to put my brother outside with bats so that we could ""Get everything out"" ignoring the fact that my brother is over 3 years older than me and has always been a horrible muscly monstrosity. If I had gone outside my brother would have killed me. 

The second was when my mom watched my brother shove me to the ground and start kicking and stomping on my head trying to kill me, then told me she would never speak to me again if I didn't hang up, when I tried to call the police afterwards. He didn't even get punished.

Also there was that time I showed my mom something I made at school with a dragon I drew on it and she destroyed it and told me to never do that again because ""dragons are demons"" or something. I used to draw a lot and after that I haven't really ever done it again.

Close for me. I was flying back from Maui for spring break and visiting my sister well on the return flight I had a 6 hour layover at LAX. Not terrible right? Wrong. (Granted this is my fault) It's about 11:30 pm and I just landed so I ask a TSA agent if I can go out for a smoke and be let back in. Guy tells me yea it's no problem. Well I go outside for said smoke and start chatting with another random tourist. About 30 minutes pass talking to this guy and I decide it's too cold and go back inside. TSA then told me I'm not allowed back into the terminal where my flight was until 1 hour (something like that) before my flight. Well my flight wasn't till 6-ish am so I'm stuck in the cold ass lobby for 2 hours and start to get hungry because I can't sleep. Well hey there's a Denny's nearby so I take an uber over there and eat. After I'm done eating I go to a gas station to grab some more smokes and get lost around Compton. So I start freaking out and call an uber to take me back to the airport. First uber driver doesn't show up so I get charged $5 for canceling. So I call another uber and mind you I've already been freaking out outside for about half an hour and see a couple of tweakers start walking towards me so I just book it back to the airport (yes I'm a pussy) which was about 2-3 miles away (I think) needless to say I did not sleep that night until I was safe on the plane.,-1

"Does ""fresh"" chicken magically make the meat more nutritious?  Protein is protein yo.  It's all bout the macros.  Carbs, Fats, and Protein.  Granted, there's additional vitamins and minerals in specific foods.  But as long as the meat isn't rotten or cooked to a burnt state where it's been chemically altered, in the end, that piece of meat from a ""freshly"" slaughtered chicken versus one that was cooked and frozen before thawing again for consumption isn't going to be any substantially more or less nutritious.

"There were lots of fights, kids getting caught with weapons, suicides, car wrecks, and drug busts at my high school, but one incident has always stood out to me simply because of how absurd it was.

The setting was Spanish class, 9th grade. There were maybe 35 people or so in the classroom, and we were all working independently on some conjugation worksheet and socializing. Being the jaded, angsty 14 year old I was, I refused to work, and instead was absently minded staring out the window on the doorway to the hall.

The bright gold flash amidst the field of navy cloth must have been what first attracted my attention. ""Shit, the cops are here,"" I mused. Frankly, it wasn't that concerning; there were 5-6 cops stationed at my school everyday.

That flash of gold came again, and this time I wasn't the only person who noticed. News of the pacing cop spread quickly through the classroom.

I saw a third flash reflect from the cop's badge just as he slammed open our door. Him and two other cops quickly ran into the room, closing the door behind them. All eyes were fixed on the officers, and one of them barked ""DAMARCUS"" sharply.

Now, Damarcus was not a small kid. He was at least 250 lbs, maybe 6' 3"" or so. Well known for being that guy you could always rely on for coke.

Anyways, Damarcus stands up slowly in the back corner of the room. The cops move away from the door, removing their cuffs as they approach the large teen. 

I saw it in his eye, the moment he decided not to go down easy. It was a palpable change. Damarcus lunged over three or four desks, and began sprinting as fast as he could towards the door. The cops are in hot pursuit.

As Damarcus approaches the door, a friend of his, a small black girl named Janelle opens the door for him, yelling ""YOU BETTER RUN DAMARCUS.""

Damarcus gets out the door, and we're shocked he got away from the cops. They're a little surprised too, and stood talking to each other. I think they were deciding that their fellow officers posted at the various entrances and exits to school grounds would catch him. One officer grabbed his radio to inform his coworkers of the situation, when his mouth dropped in astonishment.

It was Damarcus! Apparently, he had felt bad about not thanking Janelle for aiding in his escape, and had come back to say thanks. I believe he got out ""Thanks Janelle, I really appreciate -"" before he tackled and taken away. 

Later I found out he had several ounces of coke separated into a dozen or so plastic sacks in his backpack. He got slapped with possession and intent to distribute. 

I'm not sure why, but this story has always stuck with me. It crrtsinly wasn't the incident of the year; I would think the massive ""You got my weave"" fight, Emily's drunken public skinny dipping, the teacher sanctioned orgy in the biology room, or the double suicide in the chemistry supply closet would take that honor. It must have been Damarcus' utter lack of getaway instincts and his remarkable manners that forever seared this drug bust into my brain. ",41

"I do agree saying ""other religions are wrong"" is bad path to go down, but logic  pushes me toward Islam, and I don't see that in other religions.  Let me be clear, Islam to me is entirely the five pillars of Islam (1. Oath that God is alone and the prophets were given the responsibility to spread that message, 2. Prayer, for the sake of God 3. Fasting for the sake of God, 4. Charity for the sake of God, and 5. Pilgrimage for the sake of God) as well as the Quran and that's it.  I don't apply all of the Quran in my life bc it doesn't apply, it's a guidance to practice my life in a moral way.  Having said that, the main theme I encounter through Islam is to build your heart and mind through your actions and learning.   I do see your point about pinning religions against each other, and I didn't want that to come across in my answer bc I don't believe in that.  I guess in its simplest form, religion for me  is just accepting that God has all control in your life and you have to have a clear mind and heart to follow his signs to make the right choice in everything you do.  At the end of the day, if everyone made the right choice in every situation then we would all be living in peace.  But to say that we'll be better off if we accept or do something...that my friend is pushing ones ideology on another...that is the exact thing you are arguing against.  I don't think one religion is right, I think Islam is right for me, and it keeps me from following my desires, which I feel is the root of evil.  If we balance our life, keep everything moderate, we will achieve a higher understanding of life.",2

"I gre up with a very outdoorsy family, we always went camping and hiking in the summer, I grew up outside. My mother told this story to my sister and I about a time she went camping with my dad before we were born:

""I was in my tent, and it was the middle of the night, perhaps 1 AM, and I had woken up to go pee, just like normal. I was about to unzip the tent, when I heard a small scratching sound. I paused. It was a slow, deliberate crunchy, digging, kind of sound. It was too rhythmic for an animal, so after making sure it wasn't your father, who was sharing the tent, I unzipped a corner of the door and peeked out. The moon was just bright enough for me to see a young woman squatting right next to our little two-man tent, digging at the ground with her bare hands. Even your father was scared. So he went and shined a flashlight on her and told her to go back to where ever she had made camp. The woman got up silently, leaving a four inch deep hole next to the tent, and started walking away. I went outside, went pee, and got back into my sleeping bag. 

A few minutes later, I was awoken again by a clattering sound, of a person or animal walking around where we had put our stuff. I looked outside again, and the woman was crouched low, walking around our stuff and looking at things the way a monkey might. Your father stepped out of the tent, shined the flashlight on her again, and she faced him. He asked her to kindly leave their stuff alone, but she just stood there, dirty and neglected looking, but clearly not malnourished, staring at his light. He gave up and went back into our tent. 

Soon, we heard her digging again at her little hole, which was literally six inches and two pieces of thin nylon away from my head. I shouted for her to go away, and she ran away in an animalistic kind of way, and never returned.

I fell back asleep, and in the morning, our stuff was scattered, but nothing was stolen. The end.""",359

"I was up in the blue ridge mountains doing some fall colors viewing a couple of years ago.  Pulled over to the side of the road to answer the call of nature beside some big rocks with an obvious path going around behind them.

There was an open space with a firepit made of flat stones in the middle, and sections of logs to sit on all around it.  It was full of trash, like empty beanie weenie cans, and empty chips bags,  and there were the little piles of toilet paper further back down the trail that many hikers and campers are familiar with.

The creepy thing was the partial skeleton of something that, from its position, looked like it had been in the fire.  There was most of a spine, most of a rib cage, and a skull.  It looked like a dog to me, but I am by no means an expert.  

I had only noticed the skeleton after I had went about my business.  I walked over and leaned over it to get a better look, and felt heat still coming off of the remains of a fire.  That freaked me out, and I got the feeling I was being watched, and so I vamoosed.",33

"*For Gaddafi;*

&gt;In the conflict's early months it appeared that Gaddafi's government – with its greater firepower – would be victorious.[259] Both sides disregarded the laws of war, committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks.[262] On 26 February the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, suspending Libya from the UN Human Rights Council, implementing sanctions and calling for an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians.[263] In March, the Security Council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation.[264] Ignoring this, Qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents, and along with France and the United Arab Emirates provided the NTC with weaponry and training.

&gt;A week after the implementation of the no-fly zone, NATO announced that it would be enforced.[266] On 30 April a NATO airstrike killed Gaddafi's sixth son and three of his grandsons in Tripoli, though Gaddafi and his wife were unharmed. Western officials remained divided over whether Gaddafi was a legitimate military target under the U.N. Security Council resolution. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that NATO was ""not targeting Gaddafi specifically"" but that his command-and-control facilities were legitimate targets—including a facility inside his sprawling Tripoli compound that was hit with airstrikes on 25 April.[267]

NATO intervention after human rights violations, as far as I know America wasn't involved too heavily or England for that matter, but a lot of other NATO countries took action when it violated basically the guidelines for NATO. If they're ignored, what good is NATO? I'll freely admit I know next to nothing about the Lybian revolution apart from what I gathered here in 10 minutes, but that seems the gist of it.

*For Saddam;*

&gt;U.S. President George H. W. Bush responded cautiously for the first several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had had the most friendly relations with the Soviets.[77] On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region.[78] The invasion immediately triggered fears that the world's price of oil, and therefore control of the world economy, was at stake. Britain profited heavily from billions of dollars of Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who happened to be in the U.S. at the time.[79]

It did affect America again(albeit, fat cats, CEOs, and executives invested in oil as well as helping out Israel who had a problem with Suddam seizing Kuwait. I.E; the governments interests) and most of the world, as it could've destabilised the oil industry and the world economy as a whole.

*For Hitler;*

&gt;On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland under the false pretext that the Poles had carried out a series of sabotage operations against German targets.[58] Two days later, on 3 September, after a British ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations was ignored, France and the United Kingdom, followed by the fully independent Dominions[59] of the British Commonwealth[60]—Australia (3 September), Canada (10 September), New Zealand (3 September), and South Africa (6 September)—declared war on Germany. However, initially the alliance provided limited direct military support to Poland, consisting of a cautious, half-hearted French probe into the Saarland.[61] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[62] Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which was to later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.

One thing lead to another, as soon as England was ignored and offended, and they declared war, so did every other commonwealth nation. It just kept escalating, eventually America jumped in after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, which directly affected them as did Germany's annexation of Austria and Poland.

(All these quoted paragraphs are from Wikipedia)

Mexico cartels are killing other Mexicans, and those who visit the country. America won't attack because it'd be an assault on the nation and not on the cartel. America has no stake in that civil conflict, maybe some drugs get over the border but that's better than fighting another war on another front in another nation, and this one has no real reason to have a western intervention. America doesn't care, it's more trouble than it's worth. They gain next to nothing while spends more billions of dollars.",1

 There were 2 at first, ""James"" and Nicole. I spent a good few years chatting to them everyday, on MSN and all that. One day this random person just pops into our room called Katelyn. ""James"" seemed to like Katelyn a lot. They would stay up into the early hours of the morning just doing whatever it was you did on habbo. At this point I lost interest in the whole thing but kept in touch with Nicole.

Around November last year she popped up on Facebook asking if I remembered this ""James"". We got talking and it turns out that James was a girl called Rebecca, and had catfished Katelyn (Who lived in Canada) into coming over to the UK and spending a week together. Katelyn didn't mind ""James"" actually being Rebecca, and decided that being lesbian was the road to take. They are now dating. Happy ending.

I've hooked up with girls just once a couple of times but we met at parties and such I wouldn't say that we were on a date.

Other than that any girl I've actually dated (as in, taken on dates) I haven't slept with until at least date two and by then I knew I wanted to keep seeing them.

"Based on my experience, Dick Clark.

The ""New Year's Rockin' Eve"" guy.  American Bandstand.  Creator of the American Music Awards.  The eternal teenager.

Back in the late 90s I was producing a morning radio show.  One of the hosts had said something nice about Dick in an industry magazine, and a few weeks later we got a card - very obviously personally written - from Dick expressing thanks for the kind words.

Then came the phone call.  I was checking the voice mail one morning and the message that popped up was ""hey guys, Dick Clark here...give me a call back when you get this"" and he left his number.


So we called back, thinking there would be a flunky on the other line prepared to set up a time when we would be able to call another flunky and maybe talk to one of the most powerful people in the music business.


Nope.  Phone rings and he picks up.  ""Hello, Dick Clark here.""


The guy answered his own phone.  He was calling to set up interviews for the upcoming Academy of Country Music Awards.  He set up his own interviews.


Some time later, we found out that he was going to be in town for a charity event.  We asked if he had some time to stop by and do our show.  He was booked solid.  6am to 10pm.  He said that if we wanted, he could show up beforehand for a bit.  So at just after 5:15am, Dick Clark showed up.  With his people who were clearly pissed that they had to start their day early.  

He did everything we asked.  Took photos with everyone.  Took part in every stupid stunt we wanted.  The host of the show asked him pointedly why he - Dick fucking Clark - went out of his way to be so nice to a couple of punk-ass radio hosts.  Why did he write personalized thank you notes to us.  Why did he carve out part of his day when he didn't need to do it.

Mr. American Bandstand said that he remembered when he was starting out in the business.  Remembered when he wrote a fan letter to his idol.  Remembered how nice it was that his idol took him under his wing and treated him well, and ever since then he tried to pay it forward.

Oddly enough, his idol (that he wrote to) was Steve Allen.  The creator of the Tonight Show.  I now work in the same building where Steve Allen got his start as a radio announcer.

Anyway, Dick Clark...class act.  Went above and beyond for some young bucks who were far beneath him, and was gracious, generous, and very cool about all of it.",2

Teacher refused any kind of doctor's note or excuse, even when my mom personally informed him of the situation. Little bro ended up getting zeros on all work/tests during that time period. Jerk. Everybody knows you wear a toupee. 

I also had an art teacher who, when you'd ask him for help, he'd take the paintbrush/pen/pencil from you and just do the technique on your artwork. It drove everyone crazy, and we used to joke about ""why don't you just sign your name at the bottom while you're at it.""  He was still doing it years later with that same brother, and when my mom brought it up at a parent/teacher conference, he said, ""Oh, I don't do that anymore.""  Uh, yeah, you do, AND everyone knows that you also wear a toupee!

"one of my college roommates came back from winter break with her new boyfriend in tow, he was only going to stay a few days, then few weeks, then he was there for the whole semester. I moved out after that. 

I asked him not to smoke inside in the apartment, because it would make our apartment smell like smoke and since I was the one who put the money in for the security deposit I wanted as much as I could back. He decided he would just smoke in their bedroom... which still made it smell.

he would eat all the food I would buy for myself, never pitched in for any groceries or utilities.

he was too lazy to get up and pee in the bathroom which was 3 feet from his bedroom, so he would pee in a bottle in their room and then when my roommate came home she would empty the bottle. He terrorized my cat, then they got a puppy together (They have had many puppies but then abandon them in a walmart parking lot etc. because they are dicks and dont care about animals (she had to the nerve to ask to keep the cat we got together that he fucking terrorized NOPE I paid vet bills, and the cat liked me best, my cat STILL MY CAT AFTER 9 YEARS). 

 basically I am saying I totally feel your pain.

"&gt; You do realise that we're dealing with supposedly responsible adults here right? Not teenagers.

Both are human. Humans are susceptible to their surroundings. As I said, the idea that people are completely autonomous decision makers is not true. 

[Standford prison experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) is a prime example on how supposedly responsible adult beings can change their behavior under outside influence. [Milgarm experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) is another example how humans are fallible to make questionable decisions due to outside factors.

We are social animals who eat, shit and take cues from our environment how to act. We don't have true free will. It is naive idealism to think otherwise, and most of all, it's silly to base a political view on this naive childish view of humanity. Reality demands realpolitik, not idealism about beautiful independent unique snowflake human beings.

&gt;Haha, susceptible to crimes, don't make me laugh.

It is well known that poverty and poor education causes criminal behavior. It is well known that reducing poverty and improving education reduces criminal behavior.

&gt;They aren't victims at all, if you commit a crime that's your personal responsibility.

That doesn't mean the government should ignore the causes for their decisions, like poverty and poor education.

&gt;We shouldn't turn our country into one giant mental hospital, and you don't solve problems by creating other problems to replace them.

I didn't talk about creating other problems.

&gt; If people are financially retarded, for lack of a better term, it's a rather bad idea to give them money don't you think?

No, because it should be studied what causes their poverty. If the cause is for example the job market having less jobs to offer than there are unemployed people, sure the unemployed people cannot be blamed for the lack of open jobs in the market?",1

More specifically though, it's the idea that this all powerful being gives a shit which set of genitalia someone happens to prefer, or that our consciousness and soul live on even after we die, contradicting even the most basic of biological and physical facts, or that fun things like alcohol/drugs and masturbation are somehow inherently immoral, or how you just ignore how contradictory the Quran is by simply picking and choosing which bits are true and which aren't.

"Suicide isn't so much wanting to die so much as it is not wanting to live. People thinking about suicide haven't chosen it over their other options, they just feel like it's the only one they really have. This is why tendencies towards suicide are sad for the victim, and not more inspired or cheerful. So the desire to die isn't truly there.

And it isn't as peaceful as it might seem. Jumping off a building or slowly drifting to a long sleep might seem simple enough (and in a way, very peaceful), but the path a person takes to get there is difficult and painful.   

You can say it's not bad compared to being murdered, or being raped/murdered, or being killed as part of genocide, but you'd be able to say that about a lot of things. Certainly a long period of depression followed by suicide is worse than dying peacefully, or even obliviously. Your friends and family won't wonder if they could've changed it, and they won't wonder if it's their fault (fears that a note won't change). And you'll be happier.  

Ultimately what it comes down to is that humans don't like being sad, and depression and thoughts of suicide make us sad. ",40

I find a lot of the time that the person that is acting obviously like an asshole usually has some severe life problems and that is their anger and cry for help showing.  IMO the ones to watch out for are the people who fit in but show the inability to step into someone elses shoes.  These people feel nothing when they cause others pain and often use it to get ahead because others are unwilling to deal with the guilt.

I think it is relativley difficult to discern these people right away but if you pay attention you can see them doing things like manipulating people against eachother or using flattery and/or gifts/bribes to get close enough to people to get damning info to use against them.

Did you read my comment? Because if you did you'd see he was proven logically arrogant while me not being.

Arrogance is not the same as conceit. Conceit is just general pride in oneself irrespective anything. Just an innate pride. Arrogance isn't that. Arrogance is placing a really high level of importance in something, and then gleaning self worth from that. IE Im a really great musician, so I act like music is the most important thing in the universe to justify my existence and find value in life.

His claim of arrogance evidenced that placing of importance in things like being attractive, intelligent, and athletic. Which is the very definition of arrogance. I said those things because they're true, I place no inherent value in any of them.

Im super good looking, but still manage to be shy and insecure. Very intelligent but I wish I weren't. Perfect eyesight but think I'd look older and more mature with glasses. Shall I keep going?

The fellow who responded to me was a twat, and a stupid one at that. Who was the very thing he accused me of being. You? You're even worse for seeing the response and responding with the same sentiment.

&gt; What would be arrogant is if you were to say ""I'm better than you because I have a bigger pinky toe!""

Which was never said. It was what you heard, because you're a neurotic little twerp who places undue importance on things like intelligence. Someone smarter than you stating they're smarter than you should be no less offensive than someone with a bigger pinky toe stating they have a bigger pinky toe.

"The two most important skills to develop for empathy are:

1. Everyone is like you. 

2. Not everyone is like you. 

Point number one is about humanizing the other. Sometimes we reduce people to flat stereotypes - crazy sjw, creepy fat nerd. In actuality, everyone is a complex, three-d, fully fleshed person, the all-important main character in their story just like you are in yours. We all have basically the same package of feelings, desires, etc. This is also usually what people think of when they think of empathy. But it alone is not enough. 

Point number two is recognizing that your paradigm is not the only correct paradigm that exists. Paradigms are ways of viewing the world, filtering the information we receive, interpreting that information. We tend to project our paradigm onto everyone else. As a very simple example, an extroverted person might think their friend keeps turning down invitations to parties because the friends secretly hates the extrovert (because that's what it would mean of the extrovert did it). In fact, the introvert simply doesn't experience invitations to parties the same way the extrovert does. 


In general, an easy, fairly politically neutral way to explore the second type of empathy is through personality typing systems. A fairly common, popular one is mbti. Understanding how Ns/Ss or Ts/Fs etc see the world differently can help you understand how someone else can react to things totally differently than you would. Another example of something very simple that helps people is the 5 Love Languages - the idea that, even though for you a hug is the best way to express affection, for someone else hugs don't do much, but compliments really matter, and *neither of you are wrong*

There are many kinds of paradigms, for example the personality related ones I just listed. But there are also cultural paradigms. Cultural paradigms are perspectives that are supported, perpetuated, reinforced by the culture around us. I mentioned above stereotypes. Stereotypes are cultural paradigms. 

Part of developing empathy is recognizing the cultural paradigms surrounding us. 

---

And this brings us to the topic reddit loves to hate, privilege. 

Privilege¹, with regards to developing empathy, can be viewed as just another variation on what I described about extroverts and introverts. There are groups of people who experience things one way, and groups of people who experience them another way. What makes something privilege is when a certain perspective is taken as *default*, and the other perspective is ignored. The experience of one group is ""reality"", the experience of the other group is not. This is almost always because one group has the ability to insulate themselves from the experience of the other group, and so as far as they're concerned that experience doesn't exist. The other group usually doesn't get that chance. (for example, if one group is a majority, by nature of math they will know many other people of the majority and few if any of the minority) 

For a non-majority example, consider wealth and poverty. 

It is the privilege of the wealthy to be able to believe that ""money isn't that important"", ""if you're struggling financially you should just work harder"", etc. Most wealthy people are never even exposed to what real poverty is like. Therefore, they can be completely oblivious to what opportunities they have that others do not. (Generally speaking, despite being a minority, wealthy people only associate with others like themselves) 

All of the default perspectives in a society are privileged. Generally, you can guess what those default perspectives are by watching some TV. What gender, race, religion, class, economic level, orientation are the main characters? 

The best way to understand the perspective of people not in your privilege class is to 

1. Listen 
2. *Actually* listen 

I'll link you to some articles, in a moment. But first I'll explain what you shouldn't do - you shouldn't dismiss what the people who are different from you are describing. I say this only because it's distressingly common. I once had someone tell me that ___ism didn't exist because *he'd* never seen it. He'd also never so much as met someone who was ___. I hope you can see the problem in his brilliant logic. 

If a woman says ""when I walk out into a parking lot at night, I always have at least three plans how to escape or fight back if I need to"", there's a certain kind of person who will say ""that's ridiculous, you're paranoid, I never do that.""

Don't be that person. 

**things I have read that helped me develop my own empathy and hopefully can help others too, but obviously not a complete list**

http://whatever.scalzi.com/2005/09/03/being-poor/ (poverty) 
http://cryptoxin.livejournal.com/55680.html (it's not about you) 
http://ciderpress.livejournal.com/214072.html (both race and it's not about you) 
http://nextian.livejournal.com/251326.html (discussion of cultural appropriation in jewish context) 

Okay, I'm actually having difficulty digging up specific links, so that's all I've got for now- I remember each of those links for specific reasons, but there's so much more out there to read. You can Google things like ""experience racism"" and find people describing their experiences. In addition, metafilter.com almost certainly has high quality reading material under related tags.

"I would consider myself pretty socially/economically progressive, but I'm still ""old-fashioned"" about quite a few things. 

* **You shouldn't own any appliance, tool or technology unless you understand how it works, at least on an elementary level.** I come from a long line of farmers and other simple folk, if something broke it wasn't tossed, instead repaired or broken down into spare parts. Everything will eventually break, and our disposable, designed-obsolescence world contributes to a lot of our global problems. 

* **Polyamory is always one sided.** A lot of people today think they can maintain a polyamorous relationship, which I don't think is at all possible. From an outsiders point of view, to me it always seems that one person in the relationship is looking for a way out, but has financial or personal obligations to the other and can't outright end it. Additionally, the foundation of a good romantic relationship is always trust, and the sad truth is, you can't trust someone who isn't entirely devoted to moving your relationship forward. It is impossible for someone to compartmentalize their feelings in this way, instead it will create a huge amount of confusion and uncertainty that instead will unravel the relationship.

* **Children should always be raised in two parent homes.** This isn't a knock to all the hard-working single mothers and fathers of the world. Nor is it an attack on anyone who has children and doesn't lead a conventional, hetero-normative lifestyle. Instead, I think it's extremely difficult for one individual to commit the amount of time necessary for a child to reach adulthood equipped with the skills, and having the emotional bearing with all of the effort coming from only a single individual. Children take a massive amount of effort to raise, and growing up with half of that is seriously disruptive to their well-being.

I have a of other ""old-fashioned"" views, but these are probably the most controversial. ",2

This went on for a few years before I found someone who gave me codeine which I also had to abuse but to a lesser extent. Finally a doctor figured it out and I had surgery which changed everything. Now I only need 1 paracetamol per day of pain. just something to think about - sometimes people may be abusing them because they have no other choice.,1

If there was a 100% guaranteed, non-reversible way to prevent a child from being born, and an ethical way to enforce that on the couple, then there wouldn't be an issue.

I was fine being single and didn't have any interest  in dating, and I definitely thought all those Hollywood tropes like ""love at first sight"" or ""you just know they're the one"" were ridiculous bullshit. I was always sort of a prickly, distant loner of a person, and I had a very hard time showing affection to anyone. I didn't even like the idea of being affectionate. I figured I'd just meet someone, decide ""I can tolerate this person"" and we'd get married someday.

Then I walked into a new job, saw the man that would later become my husband, and it was like getting hit by lightning. I knew, from the second we met, he was ""the one"" for me. I didn't even know his name, but I was 100% sure we were supposed to be together. I turned into a giddy, giggling schoolgirl. He says he felt the same certainty as soon as he saw me. After we talked and realized we had a ton in common, we started dating. That was 8 years ago, and we're coming up on our 4th wedding anniversary in a few months. ",2

"Yes we do agree that there's a larger problem behind the gun violence that's in America. I don't personally think that if the gun laws were as lax in Canada, as they are in America, you'd have the same amount of gun deaths as America. I think the problem is a fetishism of guns and gun culture, war, violence, and fear.

Many people say ""I'll use my gun to protect my life"", when it should in fact be ""I'll use my life to protect my guns"". The 2nd amendment is there to form a well regulated militia, with which you're to serve in, which allows you to own and carry your guns. Sitting in an armchair and declaring you're a patriot, and that you should be able to own any gun you want under the sun, of any calibur in case the government wants to take over, or to protect yourself from imaginary threats is insane.

So the easiest thing to do, to treat that disease first is to fix the complete over saturation of firearms in the country by either creating stricter gun laws, reducing the amount available, or banning them altogether. In the meantime, you have to work on the culture of guns. And that's going to take generations to shift. Simple legislation can be done relatively quickly, and will have a huge impact on society. This has been demonstrated in many other countries around the world already.

"Sheer force of will to wake my body. 3 years back, for about a period of 3 months, I had sleep paralysis every night. You know those usual tips that they give you like sleep on your belly or sleep in a fetal position? It didn't work. At first they did, but it seemed like the paralysis was somehow adapting to the countermeasures. 

It wasn't until I reached a boiling point of stress and frustration that I decided that I had enough of that condition. You know how when you have sleep paralysis it feels like there's a giant rubber band on top if your body that keeps you from moving whenever you try to rise?  I mentally stretched it past its breaking point. I literally brute forced myself awake. 

It was tough the first few times, because even when I manage to accomplish it the moment I endeavour to sleep again, the paralysis would always return. But each time it did I snapped that rubber band over and over. This continued for weeks, but every time I did it I felt like I was beating whatever evil it was that was keeping me in place. Every time I did it I felt stronger, braver. 

Until one day it just stopped happening altogether. I get it from time to time, but it never bothers me as much as it did. 

So my suggestion? Don't lie there waiting for it to end. Fight back with all you have. It'll take every inch of your mental strength, but it'll be worth it. ",1

"There are two memorable ones. 

First guy advertises himself as ""athletic"" on his online dating profile. Shows up, he's like 250-300 pounds, wearing a suit and a fedora, takes me out to dinner. We go to the mall afterwards where he buys me chocolates and a romantic card from the hallmark store. Then he takes me to the grocery store, buys me a dozen roses and makes a mess behind the employees counter trying to put water vials on each of the stems while they were still bunched together. He did not get a second date. 

Another guy I hit off with really well. I can't remember what we did that night but we were driving back into town and he asks me how long it would take for me to be comfortable enough to have sex with him. I say a few months cuz I have to get to know the person first and learn to trust them, and he says ""oh. This isn't gonna work out, I was hoping to get laid tonight. I'm kind of a super horny guy and I like to get freaky from day one."" He then drops me off in the middle of nowhere, it's 10:00 at night, in the middle of winter, I'm miles from home and I had to walk the entire way because he just left me there. I couldn't even call a cab home because I had no money. He had paid for the whole night thinking I was gonna repay him with sex. I'm just wondering what was going through his mind when he thought it would be an okay thing to leave a young girl off in the road in the dark in the middle of winter. Hormones must have been clouding his judgement. ",-2

"Look, here's the way I'll put it, that guy being upset that someone is making light of suicide is on _him_ for perceiving it that way. The reality is that most people don't have to deal with someone they know killing themselves, meaning most people aren't going to take it as seriously. If everyone on Reddit had to be careful what they said because it just _might_ be taken seriously by someone, no one could ever joke about anything, ever, because all jokes are at someones expense. That guy took an offhanded joke as a personal attack, when no one even said anything to him in the first place. I understand he's emotional, but he's also being irrational. Jokes are jokes, making a joke about suicide isn't a bad thing. If you made the joke intentionally hoping someone would be upset, then that'd be bad, but otherwise, it's lighthearted. No one meant to say that suicide wasn't serious just because they joked about it. 

This is the equivalent of watching stand up comedy and being offended. You have to be really dense, really overemotional, or have an over inflated sense of self worth to actually care about a simple joke.

"The Managing Director had just shit-canned my fully functioning piece of software I'd been building for them over the last six months at minimum wage for a piece of crap that was ""recommended"" by a group of mortgage packagers we just joined. I was expected to implement this new system.  

While my software was built with the latest technology at the time (C# Winform client) and quoted potential customers in about three seconds the new system was built effectively out of bits of blue tack and pieces of string (VB script served in HTML and SQL stored procedures), took _minutes_ to quote even with a pretty tasty server and mostly didn't work at all (as in like; fucking terrible buggy and broken).  

So I quit. I wrote a pretty scathing letter of resignation questioning the decision making of the Managing Director and was called into a meeting. I wasn't expecting the meeting to go well, however when I looked at the Managing Director he was nervously shaking. I'd been working on the project for the past six months; pretty much seven days a week and I never realised I was the only member of staff they had that possessed the required skill set to get the company ready for changes to regulation which was coming up at the end of the year. I realised only when I saw him shaking.   

At the end of the meeting I had a six month contract that paid me over three times the amount I had been on at the start of the meeting. I even managed to push the money higher after he agreed instantly to my first offer and I said: ""wait, no. More than that"" (I still can't believe that bit worked).  

The contract ended up lasting for over a year and I had to pull ridiculous overtime in the end to make that new system ""work"". Including building my own mini-applications to cover functionality the new system got wrong as well as having to manually fix quotes about to go out to customers after deadline day (until I found time to create applications to allow me to offload that work to other members of staff).  
Sad thing was that I was sitting on my own code the entire time that did the job properly but I wasn't allowed to deploy it, but still I got paid three times more than before.... so hey.

When everyone decided to start going to bed a couple of my buddies and I decided to wander around and find some other ppl that were down to party. The next fire over we got more than we asked for when we ran into a group of drunk parents partying by their fire close to the same level we were. One of the ladies took a liking to me and decided she was going to sleep with me. Being 18 I had never been with a woman, let alone someone that knew they wanted to bang before they started flirting. By the time we had said our hellos she was feeling up my dick inside my jeans in front everyone. Being the drunkard that I was I didn't even care. After a couple minutes, we were left alone and I took her to my sidekick where we had sex until the sun came up. She tried to get me to go home with her but since I had to drive my friends home I decided against it. Within a week I was having trouble peeing due to a burning sensation and having pus constantly flow from my penis leaving stains all over my underwear within hours of wearing them. The next two weeks were difficult for me as I waited for my appointment at the local health care clinic. After seeing my symptoms the practitioner diagnosed me with either syphilis or gonorrhea and gave me pills for both. The next week I found out that I had both. However I was told that I do not have herpes. Since then I have not been tested and was wondering what the chances that I slept with a 38 year old with syphilis and gonorrhea without contracting herpes.",1

I mean, the second season - as I think we all agree - started off a little bit weak. I understand the necessity of showcasing how Simon and Kaylee's relationship had developed in the intervening years, but I personally felt like the focus on their daughter was just a bit too reminiscent of how things had gone with River in the first season (and the movie).

Speaking of River: While I liked the direction that her character took, I felt that casting her as the (eventual) villain was a bit too obvious a choice. Sure, we all know that she's mentally unstable, but she *always* had her brother's best interests at heart. Even if her motivations made sense *to her*, they didn't feel like they were in keeping with what we already knew about her, which made her sudden shift all too predictable.

Anyway, after a season of what was essentially running and hiding, followed by a season of haphazardly amassing an army, I just felt like we could have expected to see something a little more climactic. Besides, with the amount of hatred that Mal had for the New Federation, I don't feel like he was the best choice for their leader. Zoe would have been *much* calmer and more rational, even if she *did* have those flashbacks of Wash's death.

The story was *great*, don't get me wrong, but it was a bit disappointing for everyone to just... surrender. After all the bravado and posturing that they offered, you'd think that they would have put up *some* of a fight. (Also, if I'm honest, River's redemption felt a little forced. Yeah, I know, the whole ""ultimate sacrifice"" thing is emotionally compelling, but it felt a tad overdone.)

I know I'm probably in the minority with this. I've read countless reviews about how amazing the second, third, and fourth seasons were... but honestly, I just felt like the ending fell a bit flat.",4
