We were really close - she was more like a mother to me - and I had spent almost every day of that last year with her, taking care of her while my grandfather was at work. (I was 15/16 at the time. Dropped out of school and started homeschooling so I could be with her.) Watching my grandfather's face as his wife of 51 years took her last breaths was heartbreaking.


I realized soon after that I had no idea how to be a teenager anymore. I was lost. Figured things out pretty quickly but it was hard the first couple of weeks. Also had nightmares for about a year and was often afraid of sleeping. It's been almost 7 years now and those last moments still haunt me.",1

"It's relevant to this particular thread, however, because ensign was talking about situations in which men get angry at and follow women.

Part of the fear that women have of men definitely does come from a social narrative that tells us we're *supposed* to be afraid of them, regardless whether we actually should be (and it really, really gets pounded into our skulls, from childhood right on up). It's not unlike the tendency for people to believe that crime is on the rise due to the way it's covered in the news, despite the fact that it's been declining for decades. That said, I don't think it's prejudicial or irrational to be afraid of someone who is very angry with you, who doesn't seem to want to leave you alone, and who is bigger and most likely stronger than you.

* Anyone who isn't a Hindu/Jain/Buddhist can see pretty clearly that there isn't really a god with many arms and the head of an elephant.

* Anyone not raised in North Korea can see pretty clearly that Kim Jong Un is not in any way divine.

Here's something that you probably should have learned in elementary school: ""everyone else is doing it"" isn't a good argument for doing something. 

We are on or over the brink of ecological crisis due to meat eating, and 50 billion animals are slaughtered every single year, so yeah, people who think the relevant question to ask is ""Would vegans eat lab meat?"" are doing the equivalent of wondering what the Kardashians will do next. You could be spending your time educating yourself (which you clearly need to do if you think that veganism ""isn't a healthy lifestyle"") but instead you're filling your head with mindless nonsense.

Go watch Cowspiracy, it's on Netflix. Watch Earthlings and Meet Your Meat if you think animals don't suffer. Go out and educate yourself and *be* the change, instead of sitting there like a mindless blob waiting for solutions to be handed to you on a silver platter. ",1

"Its a close one, but between watching a beagle run into the path of my car and hit it, and my Grandfather having a heart attack on his wifes birthday, I'll go with the latter.  We were all chatting around, about the meal, what we'd been doing, and a few other mundane topics when he suddenly started to lean over to one side, my grandmother and aunt started freaking out, my cousin started freaking out, and me and my father jumped up to provide assistance and ended up getting vomited on by my grandfather (common during a heart attack), as the most experienced person on scene (EMT), he took care of him while I took care of my traumatized cousins.

"A guy used a fitting room as his blowjob palace.

My ex-girlfriend worked at a major retailer in a mall.  One day she and a co-worker clue in to the fact that a man walked into the store, didn't pick up any clothes to try on, and went straight back to the fitting rooms.  They were busy with customers and couldn't go check on him right away.  A few minutes later he came out of the fitting room area, threw a paper in the trash, and walked quickly out of the store.  Since he didn't take any merch with him into the rooms they figured it was weird but not a theft so they didn't investigate.  A few minutes later another man comes in and goes straight to the fitting rooms, again not taking any clothes with him.  My ex's co-worker decides to check the trash for the paper the first guy had thrown out.

The paper was basically a very explicit online ad stating that a man would be waiting in the last fitting room on the right from 2-4pm willing to suck any dick that walked through the door.  They called mall security but the second man had left by the time security got there.  Security went to the last stall and found a man hiding.  Security walked him out, he smiled at my ex and her co-worker, and left without any further incident.

Ex and her co-worker agreed to clean the room together because they assumed it would be a huge mess.  But it was clean when they got there.  When she told me I remarked that it sounds like he wasn't a spitter.  Took her a moment.

My ex didn't have access to the cameras but her store manager told her after reviewing that there were at least 5 men who had gone to the fitting rooms without clothes to try on after the offender had entered and ""set up shop"".",38

"Careful though. This varies between Spanish countries.

Three forms actually: Usted, Vos y Tu. 

Here in Costa Rica it's different than in Spain.

""Tu"" is used by teenagers who usually watch Argentinian or Spaniard teen soap operas, and using it to talk to anyone you don't know is considered rude, and sometimes to people you don't know. It's not used here, and if you're a tico and start speaking like this, the fuck is wrong with you. This wasn't what you learned in school, have some respect. 

Ofc Spaniards can speak like this, and any other foreigners. 

""Usted"" is the formal way of talking to anyone, and is also used as informal, depending on where you live in the country. If you stick with this, no one will mind, even if it's your best friend. This is the standard and what everyone uses day to day. 

""Vos"" is the informal version used in some places, and sometimes with strangers.

All three are taught here, yet there is a focus on ""ustes"" and ""vos"", thus the lack of usage of ""tu"". ",1

The disconnect with family and friends makes the problem solving process harder and dealing with emotion.

"And his campaign really is pretty much just a joke. A mockery of the idiots out there that think the people running the GOP would *ever* allow Trump to actually win the primary. Giving him the nomination is the equivalent of saying 'we'd rather make a point than have a chance PF actually winning' 

People point to the polls like polls matter, or that they're even relatively indicative of the ideals and beliefs of the nation. I've worked at a polling company, and let me tell you, those polls don't mean anything. The amount of people who actually fill them out is tiny, and the data is pretty easily twisted to make it seem like there's a pattern there that really isn't. The people writing those polls almost *always* have ulterior motives and it is extremely easy to present a tiny sliver of the data and present it in a way that backs your beliefs. 

Trump has directly insulted so many *major* voter blocks that it is almost impossible for him to win. He has insulted Jewish people, Muslims, and Latinos. The only people who would vote for him are the bigoted and illiterate who don't even vote. ",-5

"What to expect, and what is appropriate behavior, when arguing with one another. Seriously.

Because you need to be able to be committed, and in the chaos of having a fight with the SO, it helps to know that at the end of the day, there's a plan and things are going to be ok. ",2

If you walked in and found a guy on top of your mother, would you hand him the tube of lube to make the job finish up more quickly, or would you take efforts to put an end to it? Would you still not do him harm? 

Any reasonable mother would want her son to do whatever it took to put an end to the attack.

I didnt find out until the end of the day Monday after the weekend it she said it happened when I was asked to come to the police station to give my side, But she sure did tell everyone else at school. I can't really explain the feeling I got from the other students, but there was a few that flat out asked me if I tried to rape her, which I feel was obvious I didnt.

it was pretty scary when it was happening, but I am extremly surprised how quickly it went away. I gave my statement to the police, I told them nothing happened between us and she was drunk and high as hell. The other kids forgot about it (or at least stopped asking or talking about it) fairly quickly, and I got on with my life. Not like I was already popular to begin with though.",1

In reality, it doesn't hurt you to say the pledge, so you're only not doing it because you want people to see you have issue with it.

"Old memories for me are like thumbnails on a youtube video. You can vaguely remember what's happening, but you're limited to that snapshot in time particularly.

The earliest snapshot I can remember is I was a baby/young kid and I was being distruptive at dinner or something, we had family over, and my dad put me in my (crib??) and I started crying. He turned off the lights or something, I guess it was passed my bedtime when guests were still there, and I wanted to go back out. Then the memory ends there. I can't remember what happened before or after, it's just there.

They went around the room and listed all the things that were wrong with me. I was a 13-year-old girl sitting alone in a room with 14 adults telling me that I'm lazy and stupid and that if I don't ""fix it"" I'll be a pathetic failure. ",2

Eventually though I started to get into science  discovered quantum physics, multiverse theory and started keeping up to date as best I could with particularly the hadron collider. What finally sent me over was a documentary called What The Bleep Do We Know. At 15, while I was staying at a friend's house, my love of God was replaced with cold hard science and logic.

"Used to work at Buffalo Wild Wings in Ohio and transferred to a store in Florida when I moved for school. First day on the job, we get a typical rush during lunch. I'm grilling a couple of chicken breasts when the manager bursts into the kitchen and starts hounding me on why the chicken is taking so long. I tell him it's because chicken takes a bit to grill at which point he calls me an idiot and tells me to throw them in the microwave (they had been on the grill for no more than 5 minutes). I refuse, to which he reacts by pushing me out of the way, grabbing the chicken with his bare hands, and dropping them all into the microwave. Then he looks at me and says, ""if you don't know how to cook chicken, then you can get the fuck out."" At a loss for words, I turned around and walked out the door. Got my check the following week and never stepped foot into another B Dubs ever again. That store closed shortly thereafter. ",2

I came here to say Breaking Bad. After season two the series becomes such a fantasy that it's hard to suspend belief and enjoy the show. The main characters themselves are fast on the way to becoming some of the worst criminals in US history and they leave behind so much evidence that they would have been caught. Not to mention that the character of Walt becomes less and less likeable and harder and harder to empathise with given the way he treats others and his own situation. I presume that this is the whole point - how a regular kind of guy could turn so bad but after season two he seems to lose most of the character traits which make his good/bad struggle interesting. ,1

"5.5 years ago I found out my fiancé was having sex with a close friend by reading some rather graphic texts on her phone from him early in the morning while she was in the shower (we had the exact same phone, I wasn't snooping around. It buzzed, I grabbed it and started reading since it was a text from ""Jim"". I didn't realize it wasn't my phone until it dawned on me that I hadn't pleasured him orally the previous day, or at least I didn't think I did since I was at work...). 

As soon as she left I took a bottle of oxy, washing it down with a bottle of liquid codeine from a recent wisdom tooth procedure. I went back to bed thinking I would slip away quietly. Instead I woke up a couple hours later feeling fine physically. I was still in complete shock mentally though, so I tried again. I got my trusty chef's knife from the kitchen and my knife sharpener. I have no idea how I was able to plan ahead like this in my state of mind, but I did. I ran a warm bath, climbed in, and started cutting.

Suffice it to say I'm an idiot. I'd never heard ""across for attention, down for results"" so I was cutting the wrong way. A lot. I kept passing out, but then I'd wake up and cut some more. I'm not sure how I survived, but I did.

I decided this wasn't working, so I got dressed (in a long sleeve shirt) and drove to Target, which was literally across the street from my apartment complex. I walked in, dripping blood, which nobody noticed, and purchased a garden hose and a roll of duct tape. I went back home, parked in the garage, and rigged up the garden hose to my tail pipe and window. Once again thinking this would do the trick I got in, turned the car on, and passed out from a combination of blood loss, exhaustion from the trip to target, and a lot of oxy. This also did not work. I later found out Honda makes a very low emissions CRV. Thanks Honda. 

At this point I was finally starting to come around. I'd been trying to kill myself, ineptly, passing out, and trying again for about 4 hours now. I figured in some cosmic bs way it wasn't meant to be, so I was going to go to the hospital. I got out, disconnect the hose, and opened the garage door online to find my fiancé and friend walking arm and arm toward the apartment building. They quickly disentangled themselves, said hi, made some excuse about grabbing lunch at the apartment since they worked together, and headed inside, apparently too oblivious in their sexual antipation to notice the blood on my arms and pants. This strains credulity, I know, but I guess plaid hides stains. LPT: plaid hides stains... 

Anyway, I guess I kinda snapped again. I got on Texas 121 and floored it. Once I got over 100 mph I took the first exit I came to and drove directly into the Jersey Barrier without ever letting off the gas pedal. 

Next thing I remember was paramedics working on me. Something about taking the top of my head off. I passed out again and woke up in the hospital. Apparently I got a helicopter ride. I would have liked to have been awake for that, I always wanted a ride in one. 

I was in and out of consciousness for awhile. I remember a police officer asking me if I was trying to hurt anyone else. I told him no. I remember a doctor sewing up my arms briefly, including calling another doctor over to examine a tendon that I'd cut through. They decided to not worry about fixing it...  Then I remember waking up in a hospital room with a nurse sitting watch. I found out that I had flipped the car and been ejected through the back window. I neglected to mention earlier that I did not have a seat belt on, intentionally since I was trying to kill myself. Apparently this saved my life. The engine ended up inside the car. If I'd been properly belted in I would have been crushed. I landed on the side of the interstate with my scalp peeled back from my trip through the glass lined with those defroster wires, breaking my pelvis in three places. That was pretty much it. Lots of glass in my face and head, my arms in ribbons, and a severely fractured pelvis. I stayed in the hospital for a couple weeks, never left alone because of a suicide watch, and was then transferred to a physical rehab facility. 

I stayed in the rehab place for about a month and a half, learning to walk again. I was treated by a psychiatrist there but never saw a therapist or counselor. They lifted the suicide watch after just a couple days and let me focus on healing physically. I asked after a few weeks what I had to do to get released. I was told of some goals I had to accomplish, such as being able to walk 100 steps with my walker. I busted my ass to hit those goals so I could get out of there. 

Finally I did hit those goals. I asked about getting released and was told my doctor would meet with me. I was taken to a meeting, not with my doctor, but with the hospital's insurance liason. She explained that while I had met the goals to be released they wanted to keep me longer. The insurance company wouldn't pay for more time in the physical rehab ward, but fortunately they had a psych ward where they would move me for an ""indeterminate amount of time"". I refused completely and said I wanted to leave. They said I had no choice and would get a court order if necessary. I'd be transferred the following day. 

I called my friend/boss and let him know what was going on. He spoke to his lawyer and basically found out I was screwed if I didn't get out immediately. He came and essentially broke me out. Told the nurse he was taking me for a stroll outside in my wheelchair, took me outside, put me in his truck, and drove me out. 

The next day I flew back home to Richmond, Virginia and never looked back. 

5 years later I can walk just fine. I have a ton of scars on my arms, but my head just looks like I'm starting to bald a little. You'd never know I peeled my head back flying through a  glass and wire cheese grater. 

Mentally I have good days and bad. Some days I feel like a complete idiot for what I did, some days I'm happy to be alive, some days I feel like the biggest failure ever because I couldn't even kill myself right, but most days are just normal and I don't think about it. I have a good job, a woman I love, and a beautiful 18 month old daughter. What happened will always be a part of me, but it doesn't really affect my day to day. I even wear short sleeve shirts again and don't notice the stares. 

TL:DR Tried to kill myself. Spoiler alert - I was unsuccessful. Now I live a ""normal"" life. ",1

"America controls the world and yet is entirely corrupt. The administered political process is a farce. Realize this but do not accept it. Soon you'll be voting and that's a big deal.

Good bills can be bad in reality, but they aren't working for you versus their contributors.

There is this thing called the electoral college and swing states. Understand that your vote truthfully doesn't matter, it gives power to particular electors based from parties. These make the decisions. They don't have to vote the way you want. 

Fact check and understand the farce of politics. Don't let it defeat you and don't let parties confuse you. Focus on fixing and supporting the end of the corruption. Don't listen to corporate news, it is owned in shares just like businesses. Don't listen to your friends or reddit or the internet. Instead check your facts. Tiny voting bills are silly, meant to distract you from the real problems. Fix the corruption and everything else can be fixed.

Later at another light, I figured that doing this might not be legal so I waited. I got two cars behind me blaring their horns at me to turn right on the red. Next day, I noticed a sign like that at the intersection and figured it must make it OK. Thanks for confirming. ",1

"Years ago I met a woman in AZ and within the first 20 minutes of talking with her, she said she was getting a very strong image of one of my past lives and wondered if I'd like to hear about. Of course I did! She told me I was an alchemist, lived in a forest, and did a lot of healing work with moss..... which is eerie because some of those things parallel my current life... and she didn't know me from Eve. She also told me about my aura. Regardless of whether or not I believe what she said was true, it was a fascinating story!

Anyone else have a cool story about a past life, or something similarly otherworldly? I'd love to hear about it!",2

"The point was that people look at vegans the way predators in the wild would look at other predators who refuse to eat humans. 

I'm not anti-veganism, I'm anti-idiots who try to blindly push veganism, which they call a moral choice, but then when they get called stupid they need to pull all these studies and tidbits of information out of their ass to try and seem like they know what they're talking about. 

If universalism veganism was viable and the ""healthier"" way to live, we would have figured it out by now. Veganism is a choice, its practically a religion, and while your entitled to your beliefs, you have no right pushing them on others or looking down on those who do not share them with you.

"Yes. Sleep is awful. Everynight. I think 'This could be it. I night not wake up.' In fact, everyday when I'm awake I think about an asteroid ending this planet. and wondering if we'll hear somehow from the other side of the planet before the wave of heat and death reaches us in whatever minutes it would take. Or being hit by a car. Or tripping and cracking my head on the sharp corner of something. I of being stabbed by a crazy person. It bothers me how fragile we are. and how fleeting all of this is. I can't see how it doesn't bother other people. We were molded by chance into survival machines and everything including time is trying to kill us. So we fight until we can't any more. Or we give in and allow ourselves to die sooner than later. It's depressing. It's like no one wins. ",1
