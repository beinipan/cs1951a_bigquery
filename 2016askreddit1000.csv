Jenny didn't think she was in love with Forrest because she thought she was taking advantage of him the same way her father molested her.

For fucks sake, Forrest is retarded. Jenny, out of everyone who's ever met him, knows this best of all. She knows that her closest friend and only loved one is a fucking idiot. Imagine that. Imagine for one second that the only person who was always kind to you was someone who didn't know any better. Everyone in the world who knew about your father looked at you either as a victim or as something disgusting, but that one man doesn't.
And it's because he's retarded.

Jenny doesn't think that way at the start. As a kid, she just thinks he's different and is just glad to have a friend. But as she gets older, especially as a teenager, she realizes that her closest friend will never mature like she does. He loves her like he would anything and everything else, so long as its nice or cuddly, like a pet or a sibling, at least in her mind. Her father treated her like shit, and there was no way in hell others didn't do the same when they found out she was molested. She would have wanted to feel loved.

That's where she gets the abusive relationship crap. She wants so much to be loved that she doesn't understand that they are taking advantage of her. She thinks that as long as they aren't forcing her to have sex, that's normal. Getting beat on, pressured to drug addiction, and dragged around into whatever dangerously extreme political bands they're into is just fine, as long as they don't rape her. That's why she's so shocked when Forrest defends her from harm. Why would anyone do that if what they're doing to her is normal?

She keeps leaving Forrest behind because she convinces herself that he doesn't really love her. She convinces herself that his affections are shallow, since he would never be able to really understand love either. I mean really, how many of you honestly think someone who is that mentally challenged could understand the complexities and nuances of love? There's no way they could. What they have is something simple, and Jenny doesn't think that could be real.

And even IF she believed he could, even IF she got out of that abusive cycle, she knows better. FFS, if that scene with Forrest and her in her college dormroom had the genders reversed, people would be so fucking uncomfortable about that scene because it'd be inching so close to rape. Jenny knows that. She realizes that. That is why she shuts off her feelings for Forrest, above any other reasons to stay away: she thinks she is molesting him. She saw how uncomfortable he was when she did that and thought holy fuck, what the hell am I doing?

Can you imagine how twisted you must feel after realizing in that moment that you turned into the father who molested you? How the fuck can you love yourself after doing that to your best friend, when you know what that's like? Would you ever let yourself get close to them again if you really cared about them?

So Jenny kept running away. Every time Forrest gets close and saves her, she runs off before she falters. She won't let herself get near him, and as the movie goes on, she fails a little more each time. First she blows him off after the strip club, telling him to stay away. Then she walks with him in DC, but still leaves with her boyfriend. Then she stays with him in his house and finally sleeps with him, after that one critical moment.

When he tells her he does know what love is, and asks her why she doesn't love him.

She finally gives in and does sleep with him, but can you imagine thinking afterwards? Would you, in her shoes, with absolute and unwavering certainty, think you did the right thing? Or would you be afraid that you did exactly what you had been avoiding because you do actually care that much about him?

So she runs away. She hides her child from him, because she thinks he shouldn't have to worry or pay for something he can't handle. She thinks she's wronged him, and the least she could do is set things right by raising a good child, without dragging him down.

And then she gets sick. Doctors don't know what it is, but she's going to die. Her kid is only a few years old. Can you imagine struggling with that decision to tell your victim that they have a kid and now they have to take care of it because you're going to die? That's what she struggles with before coming to terms with the fact that she's happy with him, and he's happy with her, and that's what love actually is. It's something simple and unconditional, and even Forrest can understand it.

It takes her her whole goddamn life to figure out that love is just that simple, and she dies months afterwards. She realized she had been running away from what made her happy, and it isn't wrong, and she only gets so much time together before it's over.

And instead of realizing that narrative even exists in the story, people just bitch about how Jenny is such a slut, but she won't even love the only person who cares about her. Jenny always loved Forrest, during the whole fucking movie. She loved him so much, she thought she was taking advantage of him and ran away for his sake. She didn't realize she was wrong until it was almost too late.

Fuck, that's depressing.

EDIT: Obligatory gushing, but actually I just wanted to add a TL;DR:
TL;DR: Jenny thought she was molesting Forrest because he couldn't understand what love is, so she either suppressed her feelings or ran away.

"Ugh, what a nightmare. My ex owns properties, and he had just restored a basement in one of them and made it into a rentable unit. A single mother with an autistic child moved in. She was nuts. She would send my ex these long, rambling, stream-of-consciousness emails that would have some request for a repair buried in it somewhere. It was one thing after another, and no brand new unit should ever need that many repairs. She kept having plumbing problems and insisting she never, ever flushed tampons, so it was just faulty plumbing. And whenever my ex would send a plumber (scheduled with her), she'd not be home when she said she would, and my ex would have to pay a fee. Finally, when the plumber fixed the problem, it was revealed that her kid had been flushing a goddamn fleet of Matchbox cars down the toilet. The ex paid the repair, but told her that was her one and only freebie.

It just went downhill from there. Suddenly, she had three dogs. It was a no-pets unit. She kept denying she had any animals, and dodging any attempts to confront her. They barked constantly from being left alone all day, of course. Then her fridge/freezer broke. Her new fridge/freezer. I'm stating it like that, because she was obsessive over the freezer part. She must have lived off frozen goods. She was furious and demanded that my ex not only fix it immediately, but pay the hundred dollars or so worth of food that she lost. She was also requesting lower rent, breaks on rent, and the ability to pay her rent very late, over and over. Her emails got more and more surreal. Just word salad babble.

My ex arranged a repairman and emphasized to her that she either had to be home at the right time, or his property manager would be entering the premises. She agreed that the property manager could let the repairman in. When they entered, it was a nightmare of filth. The supposedly non-existent dogs had shit up the place and streaked it everywhere. Trash and boxes all over. Nasty, dirty clothing from her child. The repairman initially refused to go any further into the apartment, but the property manager cleared a path and begged a little. 

The freezer was ruined by a massive cockroach infestation. The roaches had somehow fucked up-- something, I have no idea, but the repairman said the whole thing had to be disposed of. My ex reported this back to the tenant, who went suddenly silent.

After a week or so of ignoring my ex's email, she replied. ""My lawyer says I shouldn't speak to you or pay any further rent."" And that was it. A total scumbag of a lawyer did indeed contact us. He found every possible nitpick of things my ex hadn't done right as a landlord. To be fair, there were some things. My ex was not the big-shot professional landlord he liked to pretend he was. He violated landlord-tenant laws in a state that is very pro-tenant, about how to hold a deposit, not being able to give discounts to people who consistently pay rent on time, that kind of thing. None of it was anything that would make a tenant miserable. My ex only liked to make me miserable, so he settled with the tenant. What did he pay her? The money he stole from me right before I had to flee from him because of domestic violence. He was a scumbag, but goddamn, that tenant was terrible. ",845

"I use to work at a water park. Disney world is notorious around the lifeguard world for being terrible. First off, the lifeguards, the people who are suppose to save your life if you need it, make like $7.25 an hour. Most lifeguards make at least $12 an hour, so it depends where you work. They're also not held accountable. Most people think the red cross certifies every life guard, and while they do some, a lot of theme parks use a company called Jeff Ellis &amp; Associates. Well, Ellis is suppose to come and audit your park every month to ensure that it is up to code. Well *Disney pays them to not come*. I dont know how legal that is, but it sure as hell ain't ethical, and they get away with it. So that lifeguard, making about half the industry standard? Probably isnt even properly certified. They're also not certified to splint a broken leg. Do you know how fucking simple that is? A chimp could do it, but if a Disney lifeguard splints your leg, they'll be written up.

This is exactly it. Different personalities tend to gravitate toward different games.

Planetside 2 is decent, CoD and Rainbow Six: Siege are terrible.

It's just the bad players make the game so incredibly intolerable that the good players are inevitably driven away from the genre.

"I went to a wedding where the groom pulled out of it the evening before the wedding.  Basically they were both a religious couple who were college boyfriend/girlfriend who were aiming to get married the summer after graduating college but before he went off to grad school. (The bride was a roommate in my suite one year, and I remember him coming to tuck her into bed by reading her a Bible story.  Door never closed, of course.) What's more, this was a wedding in the girl's town where she grew up a few hours from where we all went to college so all the guests were pretty much there and had already spent money for the hotel room etc.

We ended up spending it doing what you more or less expect we'd be doing, psychoanalyzing their entire relationship at the one bar in town, pulling out every detail in gossip anyone could think of because there was nothing else to do. (Reception was canceled as well as the wedding, as groom's family all left early and girl's family wasn't up for any of it.) Frankly, as someone who liked the groom better it sucked but it's best he came to his senses- I felt it was more a ""get married to have sex"" wedding from his angle, and more a ""my religious family expected me to get a good man in college, and he is"" wedding from hers.  So props to him for realizing it would be a mistake over going along with everyone's expectations at that point.",135

So here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to the break room now, taking off my smock, grabbing my things and going home. I won't be in again.""

She stares at me horrified as I walk to the break room. 

On my way out I am stopped by the HR person who wants to know what's going on. So I explain the situation. She is upset that I didnt ask her about my hours changes because they seem fair. I told her that the store manager, her boss, was the one to shut down the idea, and that I shouldn't have to undermine him to make something simple like that work.

""Well, you really should be giving us 2 weeks notice.""

""I would have been glad to work with you, if you guys showed any willingness to work with me in return. However, I've seen none of that in my time here. How about you give one of the other employees more than 25 hours of work, and figure it out. I know you can do it.""

"Higher Education.

I can't believe I couldn't find this answer in the top 30 comments. We're a bunch of crooks in higher ed. We just want your money and we don't care where it comes from. Your money. Private lender's money. Public lender's money. Scholarships. Grants. We just don't care. the whole idea is to get as much money as we can. 

Across the street from me is an entire building of people and their sole job is to call people and persuade them in a two minute pitch to apply to our school. The floor below me has the Admissions Office, and if they don't meet their quota by the end of the semester they are instructed to go back and start accepting the applications that they previously denied. We are then encouraged to make sure these students don't get the requirements needed to actually sign up for classes, so we get the most money without getting failures to actually take our classes and drag our average GPA down. 

A lot of people are not aware that a school doesn't have to accept your loan money. We can if we want to, but we can also decide you cannot afford to take that loan out and then deny you based on that fact. We don't ever do that, but we could if we wanted to. My friend works in the department that makes those decisions and 30 minutes ago he told me about a person with a yearly income of $0 who has $30k of CC debt, $140k of student loans and is on their sixth year of undergrad. They max their loans every semester and rely upon them to live, since they don't make an income. You would be surprised how many 60+ y.o. students we get taking online classes and when they request to max out their loans they will literally tell us ""I plan on dying before ever having to pay this back"" and we still accept their loans. 

Higher education is full of crooks.

EDIT -

The reason that the call center full of people trying to get potential students to apply is greedy is because each student who applies just made this university $50 that we basically didn't even do anything for. Each agent is expected to spend a total of three minutes per phone call. That's 20 calls an hour. Even if one person applies, you take away the $10/hour those agents are getting paid and the university is making $40 for doing nothing.",347

"[SPOILERS AHEAD]

I like this one. Reddit and viewers *hated* Skylar White. She had major character flaws like Walter White without the cool anti-hero flair. Skylar White was *not* a villain. Unlikable, sure. But not a villain. 

The deliberately wrote flaws that we find appalling in Skylar's character. Like her habit of smoking while pregnant, her whiny attitude, her adultery, her two-faced involvement in Walt's schemes where she opportunistically swayed between the status as a schemer or victim. All these qualities and more were written to somehow provide an illusory balance between her and Walt's transgressions even though I'd argue our emotional disdain for certain actions like smoking while pregnant or perpetual whining aren't exactly equatable to Walt's evil downward spiral. She really didn't have any redeemable character traits, and what I think most viewers forget is we met her when her family's life went to shit. 

Breaking Bad is a story of how people respond to adversity. Skylar did not do so well with the discovery of her husband's cancer and his descent into drug-lord infamy.

And that's why Skylar perfectly fits this question. She wasn't a villain. She was a deeply flawed person who handled all of the serious problems in her life poorly, hypocritically and indecisively. Essentially I believe Skylar was written as just the average middle class person who then discovered they were married to some Machiavellian sociopath. 

And I think what people forget is Skylar was left as the survivor. She is the one who is going to have to actually live out her life and struggle to regain normalcy living with the consequences of her husband's decisions. She has to raise her daughter and son alone. Walt's redemption was his martyrdom saving his student and dying with his passion. That will be her true test for redemption--whether after all these years she can live her life and move on. She can choose to continue to be the victim or rise to the challenge of adversity. I think in the final scenes with her, we met a Skylar who had been vindicated of her husband's past and gave viewers hope that she and Walt Jr. would be able to move on. 

My apologies for the screed. I'm a bit hyped up on coffee this morning, and I happily welcome any objections. I know she is not well-liked around these parts.

"It's hard to say if it was being beside myself with grief or sitting in the pews at the funeral. I've posted this before in different contexts. Yes, I know this is long, but you asked for pain, so I will deliver. Here's the story:    

The day started out so well. I was going to a party with friends after getting my first smart phone. We rode together. It was early April in Minnesota. Though spring had not sprung, we were all too eager to pretend it had as we had been trapped inside all winter. As such, we were having a barbecue outside amidst the retreating banks of dirty snow. The text on my new phone came right after I opened my first beer and fired up the grill.  
""Come home immediately""
It was my parents. I quickly thought, what had I done wrong? Nothing came to mind. Well, the night was young and I was on my first beer. My mom often overreacted to things and demanded I come home, I wasn't falling for that one again. The friends I came with would not want to leave so soon, the food had not even gone on yet. My parents could wait. I responded ""I'm out with friends, I'll come home when I can"", then returned to the party.
We broke bread and shared beers. We laughed and told tales. As the food was coming off the grill the second text came, its chirp still unfamiliar on my new phone. My parents again.
""Come home now. It's a family emergency.""  
Worried now, I wondered what it might be. Had someone gotten in an accident? We had a family friend who had been ill, maybe they took a turn for the worse? Or maybe my sister who had been depressed had gotten herself hospitalized again. Well, regardless, my second beer was only half gone and the sun had barely set. As it was still spring that meant the night was yet young, I wouldn't force my friends to leave so soon. I responded that I was gathering people to leave but that it would be a while. I then went around to tell those I came with we'd have to leave a bit earlier than planned but that there was still no rush. As I finished my rounds the food was coming off the grill. I let the problems slip from my mind and focused on the meal instead. I was coming back from the cooler as I got my third beer when this time my new phone squawked, a sound I had not heard before. It was an email, the first I had received. I noticed the sender and start of the subject line. It was my sister's boyfriend, and all it said was ""All my love...""  
I felt weak. The world spun and I found myself sitting on the ground half way back to the table with tears silently slipping down my cheeks. While I didn't know with certainty, I had my suspicions. I don't know how long I sat there crying, moments or minutes. It felt like hours. My closest friend eventually saw me there silently sitting in a heap on the ground and asked what was wrong.  
""I think... I think my sister is dead..."" I trailed off weakly. The table fell silent. He came over and helped me to the car as the driver who was also at the table gathered the rest who had arrived with us letting them know their ride was leaving.  

The next 40 minutes were the longest of my life. We drove in silence. I wondered about the details. My parents obviously didn't want to tell me over the phone and I couldn't force myself to call and ask. Was she dead? Did she just hurt herself and get admitted to a hospital? Would there be permanent injury? The thoughts chased themselves around in my head. Then I remembered the email, maybe it had more information. The subject line just said All my love. The body wasn't much more help. ""I'm so sorry"" it said, ""I'll call in a while if that's ok. I'm so sorry."" No help there, I knew it was serious but little more. We rode in silence as I thought through all the various scenarios, each worse than the last.  

When I finally got home I could barely hold myself together. I saw my parents crying in our back room as I rounded the house, some dear family friends already there with them. As I came in I barely managed to get the words out, ""How bad is it..."" I asked unable to summon more words. My mother choked out, ""She's dead. Suicide. We don't know the details yet."" And that's when it hit full force. It was real. She was dead. Thinking it and knowing were entirely different. I had worried the whole way home about what had happened but now found myself in the worst of those possible worlds. I felt weak. I felt sick. The pain came in waves each more overwhelming than the last. I remember the surreal feeling of looking down at myself, at my family, a disembodied feeling. I was in shock, in the worst pain of my life. But I knew I was in shock. I knew it would only get worse from there.  

The disembodied self stuck around for the next week as my body played its role in the surreal circus I found myself living. We made funeral arrangements and figured out how to get her body back from New Zealand. Every family friend came to town in a procession, each new face letting me know again that this was real. Each sad expression a tiny echo of the wrenching pain I felt, another reminder of the situation at hand. My other self sat aside and watched it all unfold like some bizarre scene from someone else's life. It wasn't real. It couldn't be real. But it was. So sickeningly real. A whole week I was beside myself. I never knew what that phrase meant until I felt it. I thought they were just words, it was just an expression. My watcher laughed at that thought. It's odd what your dispassionate observer laughs about, but I remember that thought. My watcher didn't come back down to earth until the funeral. There's finality in a funeral. There's purpose to the ritual. It made me realize just how real it all was.  

Years before she had called on my birthday. I had a bad week just before, I had been looking forward to my birthday to cheer me up. But the day came and nearly went without mention. My parents were out of state and my SO at the time forgot. I went to bed at 11 thinking everyone had forgotten. At 11:30 my phone rang. I was in bed and did not get it in time. My sister left a voicemail singing happy birthday, because she'd never forget. There at the funeral I heard her singing 'happy birthday' over and over in my head. It was now sad and slow, a minor tone to the tune. To this day it's the saddest sound I can imagine. Such happiness contrast with such pain. Her remembering when everyone else forgot, then her not being there to remember.  

As I sat in the pews listening to that haunting melody in my dead sister's voice my other self came crashing down, back to reality. My selves merged and a unified self emerged from the shock I had been in for the past week. The pain hit me again, this time without the anesthesia of shock. It was real. Here was her body and we were putting it in the ground.",324

"People at my workplace are really bad about arriving to work early then sitting in their cars until the absolute last minute they're allowed to clock in (14 minutes after their scheduled clock in time).

Why sit outside in the car in dread and put it off for 14 minutes?

EDIT - Ok, apparently I didn't explain myself well.  Let's say Spud is scheduled in at 1:00 pm.  The latest Spud can get clocked in **to his paid work** without being considered late is 1:14 pm.  So Spud pulls into the parking lot at 1:00 pm, sits in his car and fucks around on his phone **AND DOES NOT GET FUCKING PAID AND IS OFF THE CLOCK AND IS NOT GETTING PAID FOR SITTING IN HIS CAR** past his 1 pm clock in time, and clocks in at 1:14 pm **AND CLOCKS IN FULL 14 UNPAID MINUTES LATE, WASTING A FULL 14 MINUTES OF PAID TIME**, the absolute latest he can clock in without getting in trouble.

There is something behind it, an acrid taste on the tongue.  A panic behind the eyes,  when failure is not an option but the effort is ultimately futile. A motion repeated so many times,  shaky and fast with each disappointment.  A craving NEED for something utterly out of reach,  but a leap is made nonetheless, with the resulting crash more pathetic because of it. 

It is the sobbing adult on the shower floor,  crying for their mommy. It is the student staring bleary-eyed at the luminescence of a computer screen at 3:15 am, contemplating the pain of a failing grade versus a jump from the roof. It is breathless husband running after the missed bus,  late for a second chance with a hurt wife tired of waiting. It is the person on a crowded bus, relishing the contact of other human bodies and voices. 

There is something so inherently basic about it,  this emotion based in want.  It can be through anger,  jealously,  depression, fear,  love,  but the core is that animalistic need. A base urge to scream at the sky at the unfairness, the tragedy of failure.

"Not a total train wreck, and a bit late to the party, but I went to a pretty bad one.

The couple had been dating less than a year when they got married. Engagement was around the 5th month mark.

They had no money for the wedding, so they asked guests to bring food. Potluck style wedding. There were at least 200 guests (big families), maybe even 300. Some people were specifically asked to bring a (prepared) turkey. I can't think of anything tackier. We had to drop off the food at the reception hall (community center) before the ceremony.

There was no dancing outside of the bride/groom, mother/groom, and father/bride dances. The bride likes Disney, so Disney music was played, which the bride and some young kids danced to.

I was the best man, so these next ones came from my wife who was not part of the wedding party:

Between the ceremony and the reception, the hall was relatively unprepared. No food out to snack on, no music playing, nobody who knew anything was around. There was a cash bar but they hadn't been instructed on what prices to charge. There were a number of people who walked down the street to bring their own alcohol in while they waited for the pictures to finish up.

The potluck aspect went sort of well, in that the food tasted good, however the lines were so long that people waited a VERY long time to be able to eat. And the ones that were last to eat had a vastly reduced selection of food available. I got to eat nearly first and my wife had slim pickings left over.

Bonus: My wife attended the bachelorette party out of spite (because the invitation was given out of pity or guilt). At some point, my wife and half the bachelorettes, including the Maid of Honor, were in an elevator. Maid of Honor wonders out loud: ""Does anybody else think they shouldn't be getting married?"" All agree enthusiastically. Nobody said a thing about it after leaving the elevator.

Well there was also a senior in that class who took it because she wanted an easy elective so she could graduate, so it was her and her friend, both seniors, and myself and a few other freshmen. Now I'd like to point out, this girl was big. At least 250 pounds, and I also remember her rude as hell as we got into disagreements because it was a very laid back class so while drawing we could discuss things, and she hated the idea of lowly freshmen disagreeing with her.

Well one day we got really heated, and she said something along the lines of how my parents put up with me, (May have had something to do with me being autistic as well) and I just wanted her to shut up. 

So I go 'Well at least I don't have to go to India to buy my clothes!', much to everybody's confusion, heads were turning and the teacher was going to break up the argument when I said that weird thing.
Now at that point, I continue 'Oh you guys don't understand? India is the only place that makes clothes for Elephants'.

At this point the friends at my table just exclaim 'Oh shit!', the girl seemed speechless and the teacher broke out laughing, doing her best to hide it because obviously she shouldn't be laughing at this exchange. One of my favorite High School Memories.",333

"Not my story but my boyfriend's. To start, understand that my boyfriend and his best friend have the most cliche bromance of all bromances. They are both over six feet tall, bearded manly men that like to loudly proclaim their love to one another and slow-motion run to dramatically greet each other, and stroll down the street holding hands and singing bawdy drinking songs. Not to mention they are constantly physically all over each other. 

Well, his best friend's girlfriend got turned on by this, and invited my boyfriend to a threesome (we were not dating at the time). You know what, lets call my boyfriend T and his friend L.

So the two of them are naked in her bed and goofing around and making dick jokes, which was not how she pictured her night going. Possibly she was expecting a personality transplant.

 She gets impatient, grabs one of them by the beard and makes out with both of them,  and then says she wants to see them kiss. Like everything else in life, they approach it as a competition and  they try to out-do one another.  Kissing quickly turns to biting, until blood is drawn so she puts an end to it. They quickly come back to reality when she gleefully announces  that she wants T to fuck L while he is fucking her. They try to express 1) how straight they are, 2)that this was not what they had pictured when she had asked for a threesome, and 3) how not okay it was to expect their first gay sexual experience to be anal instead of a mutual handy.

She wins the argument (No idea how, I assume blackmail since her tits aren't *that* great) and L decides to get things moving. He's inside her happily pounding away when T grabs his ass. Now, T doesn't have lube in hand, they hadn't discussed how to go about it, it was just a casual touch at this point with no intention of penetration behind it. They do far more than ass-grab while shopping for groceries.

She *freaks* out, and bursts into tears. Hysterical crying, can't catch her breath, etc. T backs off while L calms her down, and she announces that she wants to try again. There were zero boners left in the room with the crazy crying girl, so this time it took a bit more to get going. She gives out blow jobs like party favors until their dicks are interested again, and they settle with T behind her and L in front, everybody making out and groping freely. 

...until she freaks out again and starts kicking and scratching T, but he's between her and the headboard and can't physically get away, and shes flailing two much for L to grab her and pull her away. T employs the duck and cover method and hides unsuccessfully under a decorative pillow. L tackles her off the bed. 

Again, T awkwardly stands by while crying happens. Eventually he wanders to the kitchen and makes cinnamon rolls. He has ADD, I'm not surprised. 

L and girl emerge from the bedroom, and girlfriend announces that the bedroom is too intimate and they should try it on the couch. The couch experiment goes remarkably similarly, more crying and more confused men.

Eventually T decides to find his pants and leave. 

As he walks out of the apartment, he runs into the neighbor. The neighbor is a 70 year old woman, the kind that runs marathons and won't consider retirement for any reason bar death. He says hello, and she pulls out her phone to call the authorities.

From the neighbors perspective, a very large man left her neighbors apartment limping and covered in bite marks and bruises. Surely she that explains why she wanted to call the police- a potential crime had happened.

Nope. She worked for a rape crisis center. She was concerned that *he* had been sexual assaulted, and no amount of pleading could convince her that he had been a willing participant. While waiting for the police to arrive, the woman reassures T that male rape is just as common as female rape and even more underreported but that a crime kit could be done and she would stand witness for him if he wanted to press charges. T sends L an SOS text message, but L is too preoccupied with girlfriend to respond.

Police show up and ask whats going on, but well-intending neighbor insists that T be protected (over his protests) from his attackers and the police put him in a car while he explains his side of the story to an officer. A different officer goes into the apartment, finds a crying girl adds that to the physical state of T and incorrectly puts two and two together. He grabs L and puts him in cuffs. 

Girlfriend is now screaming, L is thrashing and fighting the cuffs, and  the officer tries everything he was taught in school to de-escalate the situation but inadvertently draws attention to the fact that he is armed, which makes everything worse.

The cinnamon rolls that were forgotten in the drama burst into flames, setting off the fire alarm.

T comes skipping back into the apartment (expecting L to have received his texts and prepared accordingly) to happily announce that the nice officer had given him a pink sparkly rape whistle that could also be spun around on its string to make an obnoxious siren noise.

Mercifully, no one was charged with any crimes although I imagine the officers have a new favorite story to tell. L and girlfriend stuck it out for another six months. T likes to threaten L with his rape whistle and loudly shout ""No means no!"" in the most embarassing public venues he can find.

"I don't know if anal is really considered a fetish anymore but here goes:

During my short time at college, I had an ex-gf from back home who was a fwb. We had done anal before, but nothing too intense. Just putting it in and some light pumping before she had enough. Well, we were talking and she told me that she was ready to get *fucked* in the ass, hard. She decided to drive the two hours down to see me on the weekend so we could try it. 

Now, I love anal. I'm 19 at this point and she is the only girl who has let me try it and I am excited. The weekend finally comes and she arrives. We don't waste much time. We fuck normally for a while, and I play with her ass to get her ready. Then she gets on her hands and knees and tells me to fuck her in the ass. I do and we both love it and get off. Fucking awesome. No problems. 

We shower and my friend asks me if we want to go hang out at Barnes and Noble for a while. I picked him up and we all go on our merry way. I am feeling pretty pleased with myself. I really want ex-gf to wander off on her own for a while so I can tell my buddy what happened.

So I am in the B&amp;N with the ex, and my friend is in another aisle. We are in the military history section. My ex is to the right of me, and the only other person is an older guy further to the right of us. Suddenly I hear a very audible fart from my right. I immediately look over at my ex with a smile on my face. She is staring straight ahead at the bookshelf and won't meet my eye. I hear another, even louder fart. The man looks over, seemingly to see if we have heard him rip ass. Of course we heard it, it was loud as fuck. I can barely contain my mirth. The man moves away, supposedly embarrassed. I nudge my ex, who still hasn't looked up, and say something like ""holy fuck, did you hear that guy?"" 
Instead of sharing my amusement she simply turns and walks quickly away. I guess she wasn't as amused as I was. Whatever. I go back to browsing. 

Probably an hour goes by and my friend and I are bored and ready to leave. I haven't seen the ex anywhere since the farting so I set off to look for her. I check everywhere and can't find her. Finally, I spot her in the back corner of the travel section sitting on one of those round step stools for reaching a high shelf. I ask her what's wrong and she looks up at me. She has obviously been crying. She says ""I can't stop farting"" and looks back down. It took all of my will not to start laughing uncontrollably right in her face. It all becomes clear. I took her back to my room and she calmed down. My friend was none the wiser. Until I told him later, obviously. 

Apparently she went right to the bathroom, doing those walking farts the entire way, and farted a bunch of my cum out. She was pretty traumatized. I felt bad but it was hilarious. I must have pushed a bunch of air into her ass while she was on all fours. I ended up convincing her to try again some months later. It was just as good, but we stayed home after. 

TLDR: I fucked my ex-gf in the ass and falsely accused a history buff in a Barnes and Noble of dropping his guts.

"I found a guy in a chat room looking for young girls (as in children) to chat with (as in sexually).

I pretended to be a 10 year old girl and asked him to contact me on AIM so I could send him pictures.  The Direct Connect feature ""failed"" (read: exposed his IP to me, but not the other way around.)

His IP came from an American University, so I checked the RDNS and it came up like ""username.university.edu"".  I checked the University whitepages and got a hold of his full name, major, home address, phone number, etc.

I followed this up by finding his social networks and other online accounts and started keeping a pretty large file on him.

I chatted him up several times over the next month enticing him to say more and more depraved things, and got him to send me pictures of himself (including his face and his junk).  I pretended to live near him (because I knew his university) and he asked quite a few times if I wanted to meet up for sex.

I waited until finals week, got a hold of him and threatened to send all the chat logs and pictures to a list of e-mail address that included

* All of his professors and all classmates he took classes with (along with the entire campus administration)
* All of his myspace contacts
* His parents, siblings and other family members.
* A ton of other misc contacts that I knew he wouldn't want to see these chatlogs.

He could get out of it if he did one thing:  Filled out a pointless web-form on a Tor hidden-server once every 10 minutes during all exam periods.  The form took about 5 minutes to complete each time (I required a 5-sentence, uniquely-worded apology per form - No duplicates).  I told him if for any reason there was more than 10 minutes between submissions, the e-mails would be sent automatically.

He followed through with his end of the deal and filled out forms 11 hours a day, failing all of his classes.  I sent the e-mails a month later anyway, because fuck child predators.

He was 24 years old, trying to fuck a 10 year old girl...

**EDIT:**

Just a few updates since this blew up.

1. This happened around 10 years ago.  I was a teenager and I had a lot of spare time.  I was inspired by ""To Catch a Predator"".  I don't have the time or the desire to do this anymore.  I know it was sociopathic, but I have grown a lot since then.

2. It was only a matter of time before people started digging through my post history to declare me a closeted pedophile.  [This post](http://i.imgur.com/llYvkVRh.jpg) in particular is getting taken out of context, so for the record, all I am saying here is that there is a difference between a pedophile and a child molester - One needs treatment, and the other deserves punishment.  You'll still believe whatever you want to believe, just like tons of you think I am lying about this entire thing.

3. I do have proof, but I will not be providing it.  It's already on the internet from when I posted redacted versions years ago.  I don't feel like opening any additional cans of worms on this one, so let my posts stand on their own.",4505

"This wasn't me, it was my teacher at my high school. I went to a small private school, I'm talking 500 kids kindergarten-12th grade. The teachers were really cool and caring for the students success. Because of how small the classes were, it was easier for them to connect and ensure everyone does well. Well there were two teachers that the whole school knew to be everyone's favorite, even though they only taught 11th/12th grade. One of these teachers, we will call him Mr. F, was slightly known to be better than the other. On the last day of school, we always had an assembly with the whole school and parents to give out awards and for teachers to be announced for the next year, and for those leaving to say goodbye. 

Now the headmaster is known to be a giant dick. Everyone just dislikes him, and nobody really knows how the board works or who they are so all their decisions are represented by the headmaster. This past year, they decided to not renew the contract of this favorite teacher for whatever reason. So when the headmaster announced he will not be coming back, there were loud ""awwwws"" from the audience. He asked if Mr. F wanted to come up to give a last word, and he says yes. He goes up and he says ""I have not be notified until this morning, that my contract has not been renewed. This decision is one that will negatively impact both me and my family thanks to headmaster M. So to all of you students, work hard. And to you M, *drops the mic and flicks him off with both hands and walks off the stage*"" and the cheers from the students and the parents was deafening.",454

"**The June 4th 1989 parliamentary election in Poland - the first free election in all of the communist bloc**.

  I'll go on a limb here and say that it was the election that ended the communist bloc and most likely the Soviet Union. Not as a cause of course but as the turning point, an important stepping stone to how it turned out. Most people in the west only think about the fall of the Berlin Wall as the ""fall of communism"" which is false because it fell only after the government of the GDR collapsed and the Wall itself was opened to the public in November 1989 *after* the Velvet Revolution started in Czechoslovakia which was in the fall of '89 *after* the election. I remember walking with my parents (my father was a member of the de-legalized opposition) as they cast the vote for someone other than the communist party. That was quite unreal just like [the election posters with Gary Cooper playing the sheriff](https://www.galeriagrafikiiplakatu.pl/www/images/pics/images/4541_2009cf64.jpg)

Most people don't realize how important an event it was mostly because you never think of something so obvious being so significant. However if that election wasn't ""won"" as it was things might have turned out differently for every country in the Soviet bloc save for Germany. It was the first free election in the whole communist bloc and the event that *really* started all the revolution including the fall of the Berlin Wall several months later. It only had about 30% seats on a free mandate (not the communist party) but every single one of them was lost by the communists who expected to win a significant portion of them (in addition to the other 70% guaranteed). It was such an incomprehensible shock to the party elite that it all but collapsed and the in-fighting between the younger, liberal members and old guard started for good. Partly as a result of that people in all the other countries started demanding similar arrangements which led to the so called ""Velvet Revolution"" in Czechoslovakia in October-November 1989, the opening of the Berlin wall in GDR in November 1989, the (violent!) overthrow of Nicolae Ceaucescu in Romania, the free elections in Hungary in March 1990 etc etc. And the first step in the collapse of the USSR the winter of 1990 when Lithuania started its fight to regain independence.

----

It's a bit of a cheat code because growing up in a communist country it's not that hard to witness one of the most important events in recent history. People who have absolutely no idea what the Cold War was and how different the world was with the USSR still around will not understand- and unfortunately that's the majority of reddit. Cold War is like WW2 only less fun. 

We are not talking 9/11. Americans go crazy about 9/11 and everyone knows about it because it was *all over TV*  but you know what? Nobody outside America really gives a shit- especially if they're not in ""the West"" or are older than 25.  And it really did *not* affect nearly as much as the Cold War did.  Besides ...On 9/11 I was watching as it was happening in a bar on a Mediterranean beach and you know what... nobody cared for it any more than about the 2004 tsunami. People oohed and aahed and gasped and then they turned away and went back to the beach. Do you know why? 

Because if you are not in France or Italy  to go to the Mediterranean  you go through parts of Europe that *just stopped being torn apart by a decade-long war*. I mean literally tank and car wreckages on the side of the road as we drove by. 

Because unlike America we had our share of misfortune and war and don't feel so self-important about our place in the world (to our doom apparently as Ms. Merkel shows). 

Because Europe had genuine terror threats - from the Red Brigades, through IRA, through ETA, through PLO&amp; co operatives, through other extremist groups including those sponsored by the US (Gladio) - and not one in a million sort of events. 

Because half of Europe lived under a regime that makes Bush (or Obama if you're non-fascist republican) look like the Easter Bunny.

So that's why I chose to speak of something that very few people know of, most don't realize how important it was (I certainly didn't for a very long time). Put it in context. We are talking waking up one day and the United States no longer existing as a country because Canada had an election. It's like the end of WW2, landing on the Moon, the Bolshevik revolution overthrowing the Tsar... perhaps Yeltsin taking down Gorbachev.  It is just not very well known because all the TV was looking at the Berlin Wall when it was obvious stuff was happening. The election was a surprise.

 Sorry guys but in hindsight not even the towers coming down count here. Iraq would happen regardless *somehow* and all the mess currently in place was something America worked for really really hard since 1949 or 1953 (Syrian and Iranian coups aided by CIA).  Just because you don't know the ""hidden history"" doesn't mean you are right. Take it from someone who thought similarly to you until older, wiser people showed him otherwise.  

Just because it changed *your* world it doesn't mean that it had the same impact on the world around you. Most likely it wasn't the change but the **result of the change hitting you in the face because you weren't paying attention**. So was the result of the 6/4/89 election for the communist party and so was 9/11 for America.

---------

EDIT to the previous EDIT: Lot of butthurt young American tweens complaining here about my dismissive comments about 9/11. I am European for fucks sake! Stop thinking about yourselves all the time. You're less than 5% of worlds population and falling.... Do you think that people in Africa or Middle East don't think about 9/11 as about ""stuff that the Americans kind of deserved""? They do. Be glad that I only shrug it off as one of many tragedies because we are after all part of the same ""world"".

 I wish you could speak with my grandpa who fought on the eastern front from 1941 to 1945 (fortunately not in Stalingrad but he did Moscow, Kursk and one of the camps) and tell him how 9/11 is absolutely world-shattering. He would laugh at you - good-heartedly - because you have no idea....

For all of you who are 25 or younger - you don't know how it is to grow up with the threat of war over your head and with occupying army at your back yard, have your family put in prison for political convictions etc. I hope you will never find out because that's what it takes for people to realize how little their ""hard times"" matter in the grand scheme of things and - how the Russians like to put it - *how things can always get worse*

"I feel like this is a weird reddit rebellion against an enduring female icon.

I'm 25 and Monroe has been an icon since long before I was born. Women relate to her because of the shit way she was treated by men in the industry and how she essentially had to play up the fantasy perfect woman, while having this really unmistakable genuine attitude and a sort of street-smart wit about her despite the image she projected (as well as her obvious problems, which humanised her). 

When I look at her work, I don't go ""Oh a pretty Hollywood princess!"", I feel for her because I understand what women have to do to fit in and be accepted. I knew even as a kid that she was taken advantage of and had a terrible childhood. From when I was young I remembered seeing that clip of her laughing her ass off as [she tried to get a dog to behave on set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjvdw9tIoro) and watching her switch the ""ditzy blonde"" image on and off like it was second nature. Then covering her mouth and acting nervous when she realised she'd laughed too big. I think nearly every woman has had a moment where they've felt that way. 

Her problems don't surprise me, she had an abusive childhood then was largely controlled by the film industry. Women barely have enough freedom in showbiz *now*, even the most powerful female figures can't get equality moving any faster. Imagine what it was like for female film stars back then? And she was the One, the pressure on her would've been unbelievable. 

It's pretty pathetic when men will idolise every trashy, disgusting rock star with a coke habit who gloats about fucking 1000s of groupies, but will turn around and lecture women for sympathising with and understanding the social context Marilyn Monroe lived within and which she largely conquered anyway by becoming the enduring Hollywood icon. 

Also Britney Spears in 2007 was [being drugged](http://www.mtv.com/news/1580991/britney-spears-was-drugged-controlled-by-sam-lutfi-parents-allege/) by some creep who worked his way into her life after her husband left her and she had previously fired her whole team, so she was at her most vulnerable.

My parents were enjoying this tame reception when the bride's parents come over and say ""We'd like to take the groom and bride outside for pictures.""

"My original reply was more or less an attempt at a humorous response, but I actually have some advice in this area.

Confirmation bias is interesting. There is nothing wrong with having an opinion, at all. But we should value our opinions and how they form. We {EDIT: should} nurture and encourage people's ability to remain objective. 

Confirmation bias, for anyone who is unsure, is the logical fallacy we commit when we interpret new information based on previously held convictions. It can arise in many ways, the first of which in how we structure our first questions about a topic: ""Why are ducks harbingers of the apocalypse"" See, in this question I've already assumed that ducks bring about the end of the world and now I'm looking for reasons why. Similarly, ""Why do vaccines cause autism"", I've already assumed information on the topic instead of trying to find evidence. When I google search a ""why"" question I will only find arguments (FOR THE MOST PART) that support the assertion my question implies. 

Instead, start with ""do"" or ""are"". ""Are ducks harbingers of the apocalypse?"" This question leaves room for the possibility that ducks aren't bringers of the end time and you can parse the information to arguments either for or against. When you approach a topic or reseach with an open mind and let the facts from reputable sources sway your opinion, you can minimize your bias and hopefully arrive at the correct answer to your question.

My dad was a highway superintendent until he retired recently and a couple years ago two of his workers found a horrific car accident that killed several people far off the road in the woods; one of them saw light reflecting off the bottom of the car. The people had been knoll-jumping (going fast and ""jumping"" over divets in the hills) and had landed bad at around 100 mph, and launched itself over the ravine next to the road before it landed upside down on the opposite side. It  was really brutal and very sad.

I had been a bit uninspired/stumped in regard to revising my own resume, and it helped to see what people in my field were coming up with, and combining various approaches that really stood out to make mine better. 

Surprisingly, only 2-3 of the resumes I received were well done. The rest were pretty trash (in regard to formatting, layout, spelling, etc.) which made me feel much more confident going into future interviews. ",692
"This seems slightly irrelevant but:
A few weeks ago my mother, sister, and I were traveling out of the country on British Airways. My father, always busy with work, didn't join us as usual.

When my parents married, my mother didn't change her maiden name to my father's surname, so she has a different last name than all three of us. Also, my sister is a citizen and the rest of us have grencards.

So we had got on a flight from Birmingham to Miami and when we landed we had to go to our gate to get boarding passes for the next leg of our journey. My sister and mom had got some dinner so I went and requested the boarding passes. The gate agent went through our passports and our green cards and everything and before he issued our tickets, he asked me if we had permission to take my sister out of the country. I was a little shocked, because we had travelled many many times before in our pack of three, on multiple carriers through multiple airports. The gate agent refused my tickets, and said I could travel because I was 18 but my sister couldn't without a parent. I had to call my mother and sister and he still refused after he had seen them. He called his supervisor and made a big ruckus saying it was illegal and we couldn't get on our flight. On the verge of giving up, my mother had her old passport on hand, which had my father's name listed as a spouse, and the supervisor said something along the lines of ""You fucked up Carl"" and apologized and gave us our tickets.

So basically Michael Caine might've faced the same problem if he traveled with British Airways because they are fucking idiots.

EDIT: As many of you have told me, I realize it's probably the law. But how do they let us get that far before they tell us we can't travel? What the fuck do we do then? Also, we travel a SHIT ton. Never happened before. 

EDIT 2: We have proof that my sister traveled with us a lot. Hell we traveled INTO the country a few weeks before this. 

EDIT 3: I understand ""Carl"" was doing his job. I apologize to all the butthurt people. Infact, I'm gonna go give Carl a commendation through British Airways.",652

No one knew where it was or what she kept in there, but the speculation was that it was gold as she always saved money, bought gold, and there was no trace of it.  
She died without telling anyone, or so we thought. However, an aunt started going to the old ranch an awful lot in the months following her death. She went repeatedly and then suddenly stopped.  
About a year later, a different family member found a will, with the location to the secret room, a small 2'x2' crevice with a lock. Many members of the family went together to prevent foul play, but found that the lock was broken and the small room empty. Looking back at the clues, that first aunt suspiciously had money to buy herself property and businesses in the times following the death.  
Although she never admitted to it, most of the family is convinced that great grandma had a stash of gold, the aunt found it, and hoarded it. No one knows for sure though.

"So some idiot called /u/Bizor posted this comment: 
&gt;The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.

I made a  fucking reply to that but when I posted it, the comment was deleted and I'm not going to let my efforts go waste. So here is my reply:

&gt;People called the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band because of the sheer number of musicians they've influenced over the past 50 years. While there is no ""greatest"" in music because it's so subjective, the Beatles have been an influence to musicians in all genres. The jazz and classical musicians you mentioned were undoubtedly superior in technical skill, and were wonderful musicians in their own right, but they cannot be said to be more influential than the Beatles simply because the impact the Beatles have had on music as a whole is incomparable. 

&gt;While the accessibility and ""pop"" nature of their music plays a big part in that, their studio shenanigans with George Martin were innovative and groundbreaking at the time. More likely than not, John Coltrane influenced jazz musicians for the most part and perhaps a handful of musicians from other genres, but the Beatles have influenced a LOT more musicians in a much wider variety of genres. They excelled at pop music with their early albums, and then added so much more to their sound later, ranging from early heavy metal, acid rock, Indian classical, stuff like A Day in the Life which cannot even be categorised, amongst other stuff.

Edit: Ah fuck.

"Their first dance was to Beyonce's Halo. The 60yo groom shuffled around his 30yo bride (she had made the wedding playlist), who was absolutely drunk at that point. And then nobody really wanted to start dancing since most of the guests were 60 or over, so they just sat around talking while about 5 of us tried to dance to keep her company. The groom gave up after the first dance. And the groom's brother was this old punk guy who kept trying to sneak Marilyn Manson in to the extremely pop playlist, which *really* upset the bride (understandably).

And *then*... well, she had planned to sing. Apparently she was trying to become a professional musician, and had always had a passion for singing. So.. around the end of the evening... when she was drunker than I'd ever seen anyone be.. she took the mic. And she started singing. And everyone sat in stunned silence that a human could produce such noise. There was wailing, and grunting, and shouting and sobbing. It went from very very low, to very very high, somewhat like the mating call of an alien species. It was otherworldly in the worst way. I suspect she was tone deaf, but what she lacked there, she made up for in power.

I was a junior in high school. Was over at a friend's house playing beer pong without beer. We used un-sugared Koolaid. Yeah, we were that cool. Anyway, when you got a ping pong ball in a cup, there was a number on the bottom corresponding to a truth or dare we had written out previously. My dare was to run around the perimeter of the house in my underwear. So I strip down and run to the door only to find a police officer standing there. I screamed ""Motherfucker!"" and slammed the door in their face. I opened the door again, two officers made their way in and began asking questions. 

They told us they wanted everyone to take breathalyzers. We all jumped at the chance to do so. I personally had never taken a breathalyzer before. However, once they saw our enthusiastic cooperation, they told us that they didn't have enough mouth pieces and to forget about it. They concluded we were not doing anything illegal (we weren't) and left. 

Come to find out later, the neighbors across the street called the police because they saw one of us drinking beer which ended up being an IBC rootbeer. Also found out that there were 5 police officers waiting outside in the back of the house in case any of us decided to run.

"I took a date to a nearby waterpark, and the better part of the date went very smoothly.  I made her laugh a little, I didn’t get caught staring at her body in her bikini, we were having a great time.  We got in line for an attraction that can best be described as a surfing simulator- it generates small waves and patrons take turns surfing on boogeyboards until they fall.  
As a 19-year old who wasn’t far removed from my skater phase in high school, I was feeling very confident about this ride.  Further feeding my ego was the fact that children half my age and younger were killin’ it, and made this look much easier than it turns out to be.  I get on the boogeyboard stomach first, and for the first 6 tenths of a second, things go according to plan.  Before I have the chance to stand or even kneel, the board gets spun sideways and shoots out from under me to the start of the ride.  As the board slips past me, my swim trunks do the same thing, rocketing down around my ankles before I can even blurt out “oh shit.”  The waves roll me over, and in the unluckiest of coincidences, my fist slams into my balls.  Within seconds the water rolls me back up to the start of the ride, where i'm deafened by the laughter of my date and the other 100 people in line.  In the cold water and brisk late summer air, I wasn’t exactly bringing my A-game, but pantsing myself and punching my scrotum in front of my date was not what I needed.

I read the Esquire piece on him every now and then and the passage about when he accepted the 1997 Lifetime Achievement Award at the Emmys still gives me the good feels.

""Mister Rogers went onstage to accept the award—and there, in front of all the soap opera stars and talk show sinceratrons, in front of all the jutting man-tanned jaws and jutting saltwater bosoms, he made his small bow and said into the microphone, ""All of us have special ones who have loved us into being. Would you just take, along with me, ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are. Ten seconds of silence.""
And then he lifted his wrist, looked at the audience, looked at his watch, and said, ""I'll watch the time."" There was, at first, a small whoop from the crowd, a giddy, strangled hiccup of laughter, as people realized that he wasn't kidding, that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch, but rather a man, an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked. And so they did. One second, two seconds, three seconds—and now the jaws clenched, and the bosoms heaved, and the mascara ran, and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier. And Mister Rogers finally looked up from his watch and said softly ""May God be with you,"" to all his vanquished children.""",1785

"&gt; I think, therefore I am a horse.

Brilliant! 

Edit: thought I'd add something more thougtful about why the horese analogy is problematic:

&gt;A common analogy used by robo-pessimists is the horse. As engines, and particularly internal combustion engines come into use, horses were made obsolete. The absolute population of horses has declined dramatically over the last 100 years because they became costly relative to using an engine to drive your cart around. When robots can do what humans do, the analogy goes, humans will become costly relative to using robots, and so humans will become completely unemployable.

&gt;I don’t think this is a particular good argument, mainly because horses have no ability to innovate for themselves. No horse ever looked around and said, “You know, I feel like there is more I could do.” Horses didn’t offer to become drivers of the new horseless carriages, nor did horses think to learn how to repair engines or build them so that they had something to do besides pull wagons around.

&gt;But people can innovate and invent entirely new jobs for themselves. If you tell me that people won’t possibly be able to innovate new jobs when the robots arrive, then I think you have a ridiculously low opinion of people. And it isn’t necessary that everyone innovates, just a few who invent new jobs and professions that we cannot possibly think of today. If we could, we would have invented them already.

"Apple has always adopted a simple and effective pricing strategy:


Three options:

1. Entry level offering, crippled in some way. This is so they can advertise a low price. For example: 16GB iphone, a notebook with too little RAM and a crappy CPU, integrated graphics, etc. This model is designed to fall slightly short of expectations for the cost of entry. i.e. ""I'm paying $xxx for this and all I only get xGB of RAM? That seems like a rip.""

2. Mainstream model. This offers significant spec improvements for just a small 10-15% more than the entry level. By comparison to the cheap version, you see across the board improvements in specs so it seems like a very good value. ""I can get dedicated graphics, a major CPU speed bump, and double the HD capacity for just $150 more, this is clearly a way better deal than the entry model.""

3. Overpriced premium model. This is 20% or so more than the mainstream model, but only has slight improvements. For example, $200 more for a minor 0.1ghz bump in clock speed. It seems silly to buy this, because you have seen how good a value the mainstream model is. ""It doesn't seem like I get very much extra here, this must be aimed at a different type of customer who cares more about those things. It looks like the mainstream config is a better deal and it does what I need.""


In this approach, the low end and high-end models will have inflated margins, which will make up for their lower volume. So Apple is going to do well whichever model you buy. And most importantly, this shifts focus away from comparing to products from other companies, and instead gets you to compare only within apple's line.

A very good example of this was when apple released the original white &amp; black macbook line of notebooks back around 2006/2007. The low-end and mainstream options were white, and the premium option was black. The ONLY difference besides the color was like 20Gigs more HD space (still not much at the time), and the black one was a good $200 more than the mainstream white model. It caused quite a lot of uproar and there were many articles about how the black one was a tax on hipsters because it was so much more expensive than the midrange model for just a color change, essentially generating a huge amount of free advertising. The best part was that they were able to sell the midrange models and the premium black models to two sets of potential customers. The mainstream models sold well to savvy consumers and students who refused to be ""bamboozled"" by the high sticker cost of the black model, even if it did look cooler. ""I'm making the sensible decision,"" they would say, and fork over $1200 for the white one. Meanwhile they also sold a ton of black ones, because there were also plenty of people who said ""I want the special one,"" and who didn't care so much about the specs or practicality, but wanted it as a social conversation piece and as a fashion statement. So by pitting these constructs against each other, they were able to successfully drive sales at both the mainstream and premium levels, with nothing other than a color change, effective decoy pricing, and an understanding of the various types of people who were looking to purchase a new notebook in this class.

The conversation nobody was having was why buy a $1000+ notebook to begin with, when there were other offerings from other companies that were similar in spec for less than $600. ",584

On the way to dropping my mom off, my (now) husband called and told me the best man just got off the phone with him, saying he wasn't going to bother showing up today as he doesn't approve of the marriage, he's convinced I'm a gold digger (what gold was there??), fuck me - I'm just a dumb girl like all the girls he's ever known, fuck Bill (soon to be husband) because he's being naive, etc.  So Bill told him there was no need for them to ever communicate, and he should have a good life.

"The broken staff scene ALWAYS pissed me off. In fact, how they treated Gandalf in the Return of the King Extended Edition in general upsets me. I can see why some people like it, but to me I can't stand it.

I'm not one to harp on differences between the books and the movies: I actually really liked drastic changes like elves showing up to Helms Deep, and I can see that the movies and the books are two different things.

However, to me, the Witch King breaking Gandalf's staff completely undermines who Gandalf is in the span of 20 seconds. 

In the book Gandalf says that he has not been measured against The Witch King, and its completely up in the air as to who would actually win in a confrontation.

They finally do meet at the gates of Minas Tirith, where Gandalf is the only person standing between the King and the rest of the city. He stands firm and calls for the King to go back from whence he came. In trying to humanize Gandalf and accentuate that he isn't an all-powerful being (because he isn't, granted) Jackson, at least in my mind, weakened Gandalf.

He is not some superhero, but Gandalf is one of the most powerful people in Middle Earth, and in the whole second half of the movie between the staff breaking scene and being shown the mithril coat he is left looking weak and blubbery. I am not against Gandalf showing emotions, but him on the ground crying with the Witch King over him undercuts the greatness of Gandalf.

I absolutely love the Lord of the Rings films: saw them all in theaters, own all the extended editions, but I have serious problems with the Return of the King extended edition. To me, its the weakest of the three. ",120

Drunk Bob was convinced that Nasa had blown up the moon.  He was really worried about it, so during their lunch break he went to Jim, who is probably the smartest guy he knows.  Drunk Bob expressed his concerns about the blown up moon, as he thought it might affect the tides and stuff.  Jim had to explain to him that they didn't blow up the moon and there's no way they could.  He said that the moon is as big as Texas, and there's no way you could blow up Texas.

"It may have started out as a ignorant religious practice, as most are, but it has medical benefits and the choice to do it is sound and far from mutilation. Who starts this nonsense? For starters it reduces the transmission of STDs.

The CDC says 

&gt; After adjustment for confounding
factors in the population-based studies, the relative risk for HIV infection was 44% lower in
circumcised men. The strongest association was seen in men at high risk, such as patients
at STD clinics, for whom the adjusted relative risk was 71% lower for circumcised men.   

That alone is enough for it to be a reasonable thing for parents to choose if they want and not classify it as ""mutilation"".  I know that is the thing to do now days, make people you disagree with out to be immoral.  Pretty sure we are all used to it by now.  

Also reduced risk of penile cancer  

&gt;The lifetime risk for a U.S. male of ever being diagnosed with penile cancer is 1 in 1,437
[30]. In a retrospective analysis of 89 cases of invasive penile cancer diagnosed from 1954
through 1997, 98% were in uncircumcised men; of 118 cases of carcinoma in situ, 84%
were in uncircumcised men [31]. Schoen published a retrospective review of 5 studies
with 592 cases of invasive penile cancer in the United States; none of the cases were in
men who had been circumcised in infancy [32]

In female partners it also reduces the risk of  

&gt;cervical cancer, genital ulceration, bacterial
vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and HPV  

If we could produce a vaccine that could have such a desired affect everyone would take it.

"I had a fwb who I tried bdsm with.

Bdsm can take a lot of different forms for people, and I'm actually really glad I tried this with her because it revealed to me how different we were: anyway, story.

For like three or four days this girl and I are texting, and we're already close friends as well as fwbs, so there's a lot of trust. Eventually we decide to do a lot of power play next time we meet up. I basically get into the submissive zone for a couple of days before we meet.

But as it turns out, her idea of power play and bdsm did not line up with mine. To me, bdsm is still about pleasure, just with a lot more restraints on one person. But this girl was into more the power play. 

So when we got to business, she tied up my arms and held me down while she basically just made me beg for small amounts of pleasure, but she didn't use sufficient lube so it was just chafing and uncomfortable the whole time. Nor did I get off on being forced to beg. So while she was having a shitload of fun with ordering me around and making me her pet, I was just kinda... There.

We discussed it the next day and realized the error and decided to call it off.  Glad I did it though, because now I understand the origin of my fascination with bdsm. For me its about restraint + pleasure, not subservience + teasing like it was for her.",1134

After seeing American conservatism descend into tea party faux populism and covert race bating as deliberate policy following President Obama's election I was done.

While ladies have better internal circulation in their torso which keeps their organs warm and protected. This means you are less liking to succumb to hypothermia and die. This gives less heat to your hands and feet though, so you feel colder. 

It is also why things like alcohol make you feel warmer when you drink it. It is a blood thinner so your circulation to your extremities increase and thus you get a warm feeling. It is also the same exact reason you are more susceptible to hypothermia as your blood isn't keeping your vital organs warm as it should",210

"This isn't marked with a serious tag... But...

I live in Japan and while I am an American, I've discussed this with my Japanese friends and they sum it up like this;

&gt; **""It's cute when you hear about it. Creepy when you think about it. Annoying when you have to deal with it. And fun when you get to crush the idea of it."" **

American otaku and Japanese otaku are completely different, keep in mind.

 If you call yourself an otaku in Japan it has some *very* negative connotations. It's changing, slightly, but the image is still of an overweight man, probably sweaty and wearing the same shirt 3 weeks and 4 days in a row. With a backpack and a hat, crusing the 'idoru' store, trying to find a rare picture of his favorite 16yr old music artist from AKB48 - B team. Waiting hours in line just to shake her hand and get a smile from her. He will then go and spend thousands of dollars on her CDs that have her face. 

Why her face? Since with AKB48, the group essentially buys votes from its fans via CD sales. The girls with the most sales become 'higher ranking' members of the group. So, during election time, these men go to great lengths to get 'their idol' to the top. And these are usually middle-aged, unmarried men... And not exactly charming.

How do I know this? Because the stadium they announce the numbers at is next to my apartment. And if you find yourself watching the program, listen closely! Why? Because over the 10,000 Middle Aged men screaming for the attention of these 15+ yr old girls, you'll hear a shrill, sleep-deprived voice, in English, screaming from his window for them to shut up and learn how to webcast.  

Well, anyways, that's just *one* set of otaku.

Compare to the American 'otaku' and you'll see that while there's a negative connotation, it's also usually considered just a 'phase'. American otaku are also very narrow in their likes of Japanese culture... Anime and Manga. And probably a fascination with Caplico. 

Take 100 American otaku and it breaks down like this;

50 (*50 otaku left*) are totally normal and just happen to really like anime and are maybe a little too obsessed, but grow out of it by the time they hit University years. 

25 (25 otaku left*) believe they'll be manga/voice artists in Japan but eventually realize how difficult it is and eventually mature into a more realistic profession.

The remaining 25 (*0 otaku left*) are the 'hardcore' otaku... And break down as follows:

15 will make it to Japan for a vacation, never growing out of the otaku phase. 5 will have their hearts broken. 5 will balance their viewpoint and join the ranks of the tempered otaku. The last 5 will only go to maid cafes, akihabara, Shibuya and harajuku and reinforce their beliefs... And they'll then go back and milk their visit for the next 25 years until they commit seppuku with pocky. 

The remaining 10 are the funny bunch. They extend all over the spectrum and break down as follows: 

5 will make it over to Japan *and live here* only to mature into functional adults as they slowly realize over time that Japan is a normal place with normal people doing normal things. They'll be here for life and eventually cringe at what they thought. 

The other 5 will come and will stay for a long time, but may feel out of place. Not in a bad way, but in a 'great to visit or spend a few years, but not for the next 60 years...'.

For me, my biggest gripe is having to be associated with them. When some of these people find out I live in Japan... Holy shit. you'd think I was the living embodiment of Christ. When I tell them I like *some* anime and *some* manga... They love me.

 Aaaaand it's creepy as hell.  

I just live here and just do a job I love... But it's not all sunshine and roses. Like for example, right now I'm sitting in the city hall waiting for paperwork to be processed. On a Sunday. Ugh, God...

"Fat acceptance. 

No, we should not glamourize obese people. No, Tess Holliday should not be anyone's body image idol. 

Completely disregarding whether you find it ugly or not, being extremely overweight is extremely unhealthy. You are putting yourself at risk because you lack self-discipline, plain and simple. 

And no, don't jump in here and tell me ""but some people have a glandular disor-"" 

No. **NO.** 1/3 of America does not have some crazy unavoidable disorder causing their obesity. The people that do have some medical reason to be obese, fine. This is not about them. This is about those without any disorder, and those that GAVE themselves the disorder in the first place by eating uncontrollably and sitting on their ass. 

As a CNA, I spent so much time cleaning gunk out of flabs that obese people couldn't reach themselves, there is no way in hell I will ever find fat beautiful. 

As a daughter, I spent so much time trying to help my mother eat more healthily and lose weight when the doctor told her she had given herself type 2 diabetes, that there is no way in hell I will ever find fat beautiful. 

And I don't understand why those who are severely overweight keep trying to get everyone to get on board. Is it because you're insecure about being fat, and you're overcompensating? Are you just trying to cop out of being healthy, because you want to continue to ignore that you're slowly killing yourself? I truly don't understand. ",3615

"This is a copy of a comment I left on a thread a few months ago about kidnapping:


When I was 12, my parents separated. Things had always been nasty between them so I was glad that my mom had kicked my dad out. A few days later, my dad showed up at my middle school to pick my sister and me up (this was before schools were crazy strict about who kids left with). He said that he had talked to our mom and she told him it was okay to pick us up and spend the evening with us. So we get into his pickup, and I immediately notice that his shotgun is hanging on the rack of the back window (I used to go hunting with him, so I knew it was off season and that it was weird for the gun to be there). He calls our mom a little ways into the drive and says ""I've got the girls. I'll bring them home when I can come too. If not, tough shit."" He hung up. 


She called and called and he eventually turned his phone off. My mom said she called the police but because they were still legally married with no custody arrangement, there was nothing they could do. 


My dad ended up taking us to his mom's house. I remember him crying and asking if I would choose him in the divorce. I said no, I wanted to stay with my mom, and he starts throwing his head against the wall! The wall is dented and bloody, and he's got a couple knots swelling on his forehead. He said ""see, this is what you make me do. You don't wanna make this any harder on me, do you sweetheart?"" Just thinking about that now makes me sick to my stomach. 


So we're there for a couple days, my mom came and knocked on the door. My dad called the cops on her for trespassing so she had to leave. Another day or two go by, and he finally says he'll take me to Lowe's (where my mom worked at the time) to see her and say hi. We walk in, start going down the lumber aisle, and I see my mom towards the back. She's sees me and drops to her knees, crying, and throws her arms out for me. I start running and make it to her for about half a second before he ripped me away again. He had a hold of my left hand, barely, fingernails digging in, and was dragging me back out of the store. I still have little scars on the back of my hand from him. I could see my mom chasing after us screaming ""someone please help! He's got my baby! That's my little girl!"" So he throws me back in the truck and speeds out of there and heads to the back/country roads. I was bawling and he just kept asking why I did it, why did I have to mess it up. 


We finally get back to his mom's house and there were a couple of cop cars there waiting. He finally gave up, and we got to go back to our mom. 


He never got in any kind of trouble for the whole thing, besides a nationwide ban from Lowe's. Just to continue the story a little further, my mom had filed for divorce during this time. Divorce takes 60 days from filing to be complete/official. Two days before it was final and over, my dad called my mom while she was at work, saying ""please call this off. We can fix this and get through it. I love you, please,"" crying the whole time. She kept saying no, it's over. So he finally stops crying and says ""so this is how you want things?"" She said yes. ""Okay then, bitch."" 


About an hour and a half later, my mom gets another phonecall at work. This time, it's the fire department. Our house (we lived out in the country) was on fire, and no one had even seen it until the Schwan man drove by and called it in. Well by that time, it was a total loss. The fire marshall ruled it as arson, even saying it was a ""lover's fire"" or something because the fire had been started on or underneath their bed. I lost everything I ever had, minus a stuffed animal and the clothes on my back. He never got caught for that either.

Tree marriage was once widespread in India.

""Dear Mr. President: The canal system of this country is being threatened by a new form of transportation known as ‘railroads’ … As you may well know, Mr. President, ‘railroad’ carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 15 miles per hour by ‘engines’ which, in addition to endangering life and limb of passengers, roar and snort their way through the countryside, setting fire to crops, scaring the livestock and frightening women and children.

**HER:** That suit would look great on you.

**ME:** I still wouldn't have $900.    
**HER:** What are you talking about?    
**ME:** I try to pay off my balance in full when I use my credit card. $900 is more than I can afford right now.    
**HER:** (*Irritated*) That makes zero sense. Nobody *pays* for credit cards! They *give* them to you!    
**ME:** Not the card; the *balance*. The bill.    
**HER:** What ""bill?""    
**ME:** ... The credit card bill? The one you have to pay every month?    
**HER:** No, you don't.    
**ME:** Okay, well, I guess you can make minimum payments, but...    
**HER:** (*Interrupting*) What are you *talking* about?! You are making *zero sense*. If you don't like the suit, just say so!    
**ME:** I *do* like the suit, I just can't afford it. Using my credit card wouldn't magically make it so I wouldn't have to pay.    
**HER:** You don't *pay* for credit cards. God, what is *wrong* with you?    
**ME:** Wait. Do you mean that you've *never* paid your credit card bill?    
**HER:** *There's no such thing!* Credit cards are so you don't *have* to pay.

It eventually came to light that the young woman had been given her credit card by her parents, who paid the balance for her whenever they received a bill.

I sat back, cold beer in hand, and watched them go at it.  My friend is seeing double, and missed his first swing.  The other guy clocks my friend across the jaw with a right cross.  My friend hits the ground.  He's out.

"Former critical care and ED nurse here. Two stories, both of which occurred at a large Houston hospital in the mid 1980s. Every time I tell them I get medical types telling me I am lying. I'm not. Both are from the ED.

Story 1: EMS brings in a young man, about 25. He is in a decerebrate posture (stiff, hands in partial fists, turned out - indicating deep brain damage) and being manually bagged. As he came in the door he was not intubated. According to EMS his SO had found him in bed with another woman, either drunk or deeply asleep. She carried a .25 caliber pistol with her, and the report was that she placed the weapon directly against the patient's skull and pumped 10 rounds into his brain from various angles. The rounds were powerful enough to enter the skull and bounce around, but not to exit. All higher brain function was destroyed but autonomic functions remained. We intubated him (inserted a breathing tube) and placed him on one of the old Bournes Bear ventilators - very primitive by today's standards. This caused the patient to ""buck"" - to fight against the ventilator with deep ""coughs."" When he did so, the pressure within his head / cranium (ICP) increased and little fountains of brain matter would be expelled from the 10 holes in his skull, several feet. One got me in the face. I was pretty well protected by ""clinical distance"" at the time, but I must admit, this really got to me. There was really nothing that could be done for him other than supportive care and he died a few weeks later of a massive infection.

Story 2: Another young man had agreed to be ""mummified"" in a rather extreme sexual practice. Essentially he was placed in a full body plaster cast covering even his face and was given breathing tubes through the cast. Other than that he was fully encased in the cast with the exception of his toes, and genital / anal area. My understanding was that this extreme degree of helplessness was considered erotic. The normal practice was to use a cattle prod or some similar device rectally to force ejaculation. But in this case, either through ignorance or malice he was directly connected to 220 volts with one probe in his rectum and another probe on his foot. He had third degree burns over his entire genital and peri-anal area, deep burns on his foot and from the smell, severe burns elsewhere. Blood, feces and serous fluid was leaking from what had once been his rectum. We tried removing the cast to see if any degree of resuscitation was possible, but by the time it was even partially off, it was clear he was quite dead. All of us just stood there with our mouths open, utterly unable to say anything. The police came and they too were mute. I volunteered to remove the entire cast and render some level of post-mortem care. I found deep lacerations over much of his body, deep bruising and quite a few other burns. We sent the body to the medical examiner and I spent the rest of the shift trembling and vomiting.

A friend and I wanted a movie theater display for the converted industrial space we live in, it looked like a giant spinning lit-up clock and we thought it would be cool to live in a clock tower, so we made up fake name tags with a logo for ""PCT Entertainment Marketing"" and printed an excel spreadsheet that appeared to list all the other theater displays we had ""collected"" that day, fake signatures and all. We even had someone call ahead as a secretary to say we were coming.

We got to the movie theater with work gloves and a wheeled dolly and asked for the manager. When he arrived we proceeded to tell him, 
""Hi, we're from PCT Entertainment Marketing. There's a defect with one of your displays and we need to take it back to Corporate."" 

He signed for it right then and there and let us load it up onto the dolly. The goddamn thing was way bigger than we expected, lights and motors and moving parts...

This brought on the belief that some women would die due to shame if it were a male doctor that assisted with their birth instead of a female nurse or midwife (because there was such a drastic difference in death rates between when there was a male doctor or a female nurse who helped with the birth).

IIRC: The transference of germs between cadavers and living humans was found by an unfortunate doctor who recognized that he, after being cut while performing an autopsy,  was having very similar symptoms as the women who were so often dying in the hospital shortly after childbirth (sidenote: it was actually safer for them to give birth at home during this time period). This doctor died shortly after but ended up saving many lives because he recognized his symptoms.

TLDR: If you are playing with dead things, be sure to wash your hands afterwards. ",859

We were all having a good time out, considering. Pretty drunk by then. I danced around with all my friends (they all had boyfriends except the one now), and I started dancing with her. Well we got into it a little close, and already my moral alarms were sounding. I'd always felt there was a mutual attraction, but nothing as far as feelings. But all the sudden, she puts her head forward into mine. Seriously, we were like nose to nose.

I knew her and my guy friend were destined to be together, so I just kissed her on the cheek and then went back into the group.

Not a big deal, but for some games with complex pixel art, it's pretty noticeable when placed side by side.

That made me angry. I was typically a very polite kid and kept to myself, but damn it if I didn't hate adults who thought they could boss me around for no reason. 

The other kid took a while, and I grew angrier. What I did next was a calculated (and weird) 4-year-old revenge. As I was sitting in a chair, I stared at the teacher (at the time she was standing across the room from me talking to some kid I think) and, as soon as she met my gaze, I began to pee. For what felt like the longest time, I was just sitting in the chair, peeing while stoically staring at her eyes. The look on horror on her face when she realized what was happening was the best.

After that, she must have apologized half a dozen times saying ""oh my god, I guess you *really* had to go..."" while earning looks of disapproval from the other teacher (her senior).

"I had this friend in college. Sweet girl, A+ personality, we were very close. She had a BF back home who was abusive both physically and verbally, and cheated on her constantly. Finally she took our advice and left him for good. The goodbye consisted of the usual angry insecure no guy but me will ever want you, your ugly, Your terrible in bed, blah blah blah. As he was her first and only lover she had taken this to be truth. She tried to pick up other guys but was often turned down as she is not exactly a good looking girl. Our group of friends could all see with more and more rejection she grew more and more concerned this d-bag was right. One day she asked me if I would have sex with her, no strings attached just to prove another man could want her that way. I feared saying no would destroy her and confirm the doubts installed by this jerk, so I took one for the team. I get good and drunk as not only is she not pretty but my type is curvy dark featured women. She is a petite blonde with no boobs or booty to speak of. Picture Smeagol from lord of the rings naked and ready. On top of that her downstairs STUNK! It was so bad, after I brought her to climax I faked my own. It didn't end there. She noticed the condom was empty. I apologized assuring her it was a case of whiskey dick and not her, or this all would be for not. So she felt we should both deserved a grand finale, and that we could take a break smoke a cig and try again. Well I've come this far, no turning back now right. I insisted this time I take her from behind as it's ""my favorite"". In truth it is but the real reason being I needed her not to notice me squeezing my eyes shut and picturing every porno and great lay I ever had. The following day she tells our group of friends what we did and gave me a sterling review, which resulted in a few of the attractive women in our clique to throw themselves at me. Her confidence was renewed, and she must have upped her game and done something about the smell as she's been a heart breaker ever since. In conclusion worst sex I ever had, and Karma does exist.

"This one isn't a snack but it's my favorite combo. It's called a barnes pancake. You start by frying an egg sunny side up. Once the sides of the egg have started to cook you cover the egg in pancake batter. Then you cook the pancake like normal and put butter and syrup on it. You cut open the pancake and get the golden yolk and sop that up with the pancake. If you hate a runny yolk then just cook it a little longer. It is very filling so a couple usually fills you up.

Edit* I remembered another strange combo. This one is pretty simple. It is scrambled eggs with mustard. It sounds terrible but it is actually pretty good. Get the eggs out either in a bowl or in the pan and just squirt the French's yellow mustard onto it and mix it in. When you cook it, it will take the tangy aspect of the mustard out and leave the deep mustard flavor in. It is kind of like deviled eggs but in scrambled eggs form.

Another Egg one that I like that isn't that weird is to grate some smoked gouda into it and scramble it. Please don't put the wax cover in like some people I've told this one to and then blame me for it tasting waxy. Smoked gouda and scramby eggs are wonderful.",772

Call them back and ask for identification and which policy she was enrolled in. In doing so, make sure that you force them to get very specific, (i.e. more than just the things that you could find in an obituary, including her name, age, address, next of kin, etc...) Second, ask for them to send the documentation to an address where you can pick up the mail (do not give your home address unless you want lots of spam, though if you don't care then do so)

No matter what time it is, know I will be there for you and I will not me mad or tell your mother.""  

Well, during my junior year, I lied to my parents and told them I was sleeping over at my best friend's house.  Instead, I went to a kegger with my friends.  We got wasted and the party ended about 2.  My friend that drove was drunk and insisted that she was fine to drive.  All I could hear was my father's voice giving me that talk.  

So, I called him.  He was all groggy, but made the 45 minute drive to pick me up.  Not only did he take me home, but my 2 friends as well.  It was a silent car ride and I just felt like he was going to explode once my friends were out of the car.

That was 10 years ago, and he still hasn't talked about it to this day.  If any of you have children entering this age, I suggest you make the promise with your children.  Who knows what could have happened to us that night if he wasn't there for me.

Edit: Wow!  What a response!  So, I just got off the phone with my dad and reminded him of this.  We'll first he said, ""Finally!  I haven't talked to you all year!""  True dad.  He said he still hasn't told my mom and claims he knows how to keep a secret, unlike me who has ""told the whole damn internet.""

 For those of you asking how he got ""away with it"", he's a doctor and often gets calls in the middle of the night to go to the hospital.  My mom wouldn't have known the difference. He said he felt no guilt not telling her, as it could have ended up a much more difficult conversation. He was amused that this got some much attention and jokingly snarled at me for that night that happened 10ish years ago.

I'm pleased to hear that other parents have made this promise and that some future parents of teenagers are going to have this same conversation.  I hope that this attention can prevent a tragedy from happening.  Thanks for the kind words about my father!

"&gt; but not once do we see any result of this training except for Count Dookoo who's not even good enough to not get his hands chopped off by Anakin. 

Dooku was a middle aged man at that point and Anakin was in his physical prime and also one of the most powerful Jedi to ever have lived.

&gt; And all the other Jedi we know got killed off pretty easily, so it's not like they were super well trained

Easily? It took a surprise attack by literally an entire army to kill them. Anakin took an entire legion with him to the Jedi Temple.

&gt; ""he trained luke and blah blah blah"". Yeah, well he sucked at that too, 

What? He trained Luke for a year at most well past the age Jedi start training and he was skilled enough to stand up to one of the most powerful Sith of all time. Then after just another year or two of training Luke was able to defeat him in combat AND resist the darkside.

&gt;...Jedi council and Yoda sensed anger in him. 

So, Yoda was right. Anakin should not have been trained.

&gt; He didn't try and go find new students to train (even though he's supposedly the best trainer ever), he didn't do anything to help anyone else, he just went to a place where he knew he couldn't screw anything else up.

He was the most wanted being in the galaxy and he wasn't inconspicuous. If he started looking for new apprentices the Empire would have hunted him down and slaughtered anyone who he made contact with.

What he did do was patiently watch over Luke using the Force.

&gt; Yoda spent so much time teaching him how to move things with the force and not how to freaking fight with a lightsaber.

And moving things with your mind is not a weapon? Look at how Vader pounded Luke by just throwing objects at him.

&gt; Pretty much the only time that luke ever uses the force for anything useful is BEFORE he meets Yoda! 

After Luke meets Yoda we see him using precognition, Force jumps, Force chokes, Jedi mind tricks, and using his light saber to deflect rapid blaster fire. Not to mention going toe to toe with Vader twice, at first surving then winning.

"Okay so, bit of a departure from the 'INSERT CELEBRITY HERE killed a guy once' theme of this thread and probably not a *very* well known celebrity but anyway.

If you watch Homeland you will probably recognise actress Nazanin Boniadi as Fara, the analyst from series 3. If you were to google her now you would learn about her acting credits and her charitable work as an ambassador with Amnesty International.

If you were to watch Going Clear, the scientology doc, you would probably be surprised to hear details of her brief relationship with scientology poster boy Tom Cruise. ALLEGEDLY Nazanin, who prior to becoming an actress was a biological sciences student planning on working in medicine, set a record for selling the highest number of scientology publications in a month and was singled out for a 'special assignment' as a reward for her efforts.

This assignment apparently required her to have her braces removed and get a makeover (the church spent $20,000 on new clothes for her) and fly 1st class to NYC to meet Cruise. Cruise was lonely after splitting with Nicole Kidman and David Miscavige (scientology leader, tom's best bud) could not have that! So within a month they had moved in together (Cruise and Boniadi, not Miscavige).

One day Miscavige came to visit the new couple, Nazanin supposedly had a headache and as such didnt pay much attention to him. This is of course an insult to the wise leader of the Church of Scientology, one Tom Cruise will not stand for! After Miscavige has left Tom goes into a rage, slams his fist down close to where Nazanin's head is positioned as she lies down. Soon after one of Scientology's head honchos shows up at Nazanin's home, removes all evidence she was ever with Tom Cruise and informs her her relationship is over. 

This is where the darker part comes in, Nazanin allegedly tells a close friend about this event as she is distraught. When word gets out she has spoken about this to anyone she is punushed- made to clean toilets on her hands and knees with a toothbrush. As of today she is no longer in the church of scientology and is by all accounts a successful actress and philanthropist, a real role model. She doesn't comment on this part if her past and Going Clear alleges that on her departure from the church she was coerced into a Non Disclosure Agreement. Allegedly. We know how scientologists like their lawsuits though, so I don't doubt it.

So yeah, Nazanin Boniadi was allegedly a victim of and a pawn in The Church of Scientology's PR game.

""So and so"" was my best friend's brother who he knew from football, so he called the football coach that night and got the brother's phone number so he could call their house and ask my best friend for *my* phone number.

"&gt;Will Simpson (the NYPD officer) in Jessica Jones. His character always seems just a too familiar with everyone and every situation he's in. The entire season probably could have gone on with out him. 

He was meant to be that way. Kilgrave was the face side of the patriarchal coin - he saw women as objects, believed his power and his personal suffering entitled him to do what and who he wanted. He was the obvious evil, the leering boss, the rapist, the guy who thinks women owe him attention just because.

Simpson was the flip side of the coin - the way he treated women didn't appear overtly bad. He was superficially respectful. But it was obvious to see that he didn't actually respect the women he was with. His self-image was built around being the stereotypical manly man - strong, virtuous, defender of women. Once that was challenged by his initial brainwashing, he starts spiraling quickly. First, he GOES BACK to the woman he abused, and imposes himself on her until she forgives him. Once he becomes the protector again, he pushes hard to keep the role - inserting himself into Jessica and Trish's plans several times against their wishes. He dislikes Jessica because she's strong enough to not need him. And when he eventually realizes Jessica is capable of stopping Kilgrave where he can't, he does absolutely anything to regain his control/role. In the end, it isn't about Trish anymore, she's just the trophy that Simpson feels entitled to as the protector. Simpson is the abusive boyfriend / husband, the guy who claims to love women, but hates it if they're more than just a wife/mother. 

Jessica Jones, as a show, is HUGELY feminist. You couldn't have a show that focuses on women fighting for their independence and right to self-control without showing what they're fighting against. Kilgrave is the obvious villain, but Simpson is just as bad in his own way. ",170

"Wasn't camping but I used to live in a very heavily wooded area with lots of wild life. 

One night I was walking home from my friends house, and it's pretty dark but I could see from the moonlight. It's about a 5-10 minute walk, but there are no other houses in between ours. 

As I'm walking I hear this lady scream incredibly loud up this small hill from me. It was blood curdling. Terrifying as well, because she did it again almost immediately after. But the second time I realized it sounded a little strange, and that it wasn't a woman but a mountain lion. I started walking a little bit faster, but I didn't hear the screen again. 

A little farther down the road I heard some branches break behind me, off to the left. I kept walking, basically trying to ignore it. A little farther I hear more breaking, but behind me to the right. Then again, to the left. I walked even faster, but was very deliberate not to run. I didn't want the mountain lion (which I am sure was stalking me) to feel like the hunt was on. I kept hearing twigs breaking on either side, back and forth. 

Luckily for me, I had reached my house and I was able to get inside without incident, but it still sends shivers down my spine when I think about what could have happened, if it was hungrier or if I had run, or if it just attacked me. ",215

"One semester I took an advanced physics course, but it was at 7AM. I absolutely could not get myself to wake up in time to get to class. I was late for several classes, and then started skipping it altogether. I eventually forgot that I was even enrolled in the class.

One morning I awoke in a panic. I looked at my clock and the thought just hit me that I simply hadn't been to this class in a month. I got ready and headed off to class. When I entered the class the teacher handed me a paper. I asked, ""what's this?"" He said, ""your midterm."" Needless to say I got a flat F.

I went to his office afterwards and made up some bullshit story about a death in the family, and bargained with him to give me a second chance. If I got an A on the final, he agreed to drop the midterm score from my average. I went nuts studying for the rest of the semester and got 100% on the final and passed with a B-.

To this day, I still have nightmares that I am enrolled in some class and I forgot about it. Like I'm 35 and I'm at the office, and HOLY SHIT I FORGOT ABOUT MY PHYSICS EXAM WAIT IM NOT EVEN IN SCHOOL ANYMORE HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE AAAHHHHH!",147

"This was a few years back, when I was around 15 or so. My younger brother is autistic, only mildly so we don't deal with him all that much differently than any other kid, but he can get a bit much with the questions, feels like you're getting interrogated at times he has so much to ask, but it's easy to cut him a little slack with it, no big deal. At the time he was around 6 and I had a friend over for a little while, just playing some games on my xbox. My younger brother politely knocks on my door so I tell him to come in, and he proceeds to start questioning us on what we're playing, about the game etc etc, normal questions, just lots of them. Eventually my friend has had enough and tells him he needs to shut up, younger brother responds by saying hes only asking and asks me another question. before anyone has a chance to do anything my friend decides to shout at him to shut up and proceeds to slap my younger brother around the head. Got kicked out pretty quick and our friendship deteriorated pretty rapidly after that.

Edit: to those of you asking what happened after not a whole lot I'll be honest as much as I would have liked to I didn't kick his ass. After questioning what he just did he had absolutely no remorse so I told him to get out, nice and simple. Younger brother was fine, he's a trooper. And finally not that it makes any difference but yes he was aware that my younger brother was autistic, wouldn't have excused his actions of he didn't though",1825

"Touring musician.

""Must be nice to play songs for a living. I'm good at guitar/singing/etc. Easy work!""

Unfortunately, people seem to forget that being on tour is like being on constant business trips for your job. A lot of sacrifices are made - miss out on family and friends events like weddings and birthdays and especially watching kids grow up, holidays - stuff that normal people get to do that a touring musician doesn't get to do cause they're not around...yay Thanksgiving dinner at Denny's in the middle-of-fuck-nowhere Midwest cause it's dinner time and literally nothing else is open.

Not to mention bus life is like sharing a hallway to live in with 8-12 people (band + crew); even worse if you're in a van, which is 90% of touring bands cause a bus is roughly $1,000 a day to run - gotta have label support or someone with a lot of money! So no privacy or real ability to get ""alone time"" away from people on the tour when you're fed up with their shit; even if it's just mildly annoying mannerisms, being stuffed in a small space with them with no escape can drive a person insane.

I could go on and on, but every time I hear people say, ""Oh, so and so is an idiot for quitting Band X! They were living the dream and threw it away,"" I wanna lose it. It takes a special breed of person to live the life of being on the road a lot, and that's just for being in the 1% of mid level to headlining national club acts (play 1-2k person venues). Burnout happens and some people just can't take it anymore or were never built for the rigors of the road (or also want to make more money than a part time Starbucks barista).

Bonus - why do so many touring musicians end up with substance abuse problems? Sure, some are psychologically fucked up addicts (hi Wes Scantlin!) but many others get them cause of ""hurry up and wait, especially when more of the day-to-day tour activities get delegated to crew so the band doesn't have to worry about them (gotta keep them fresh to give their best performance). It's like being on your business trips, but you're back at the hotel and...""now what do you do?"" All the time.

Edit: another bonus! Showering and personal hygiene is a pain in the ass on the road. Most American clubs don't have showers, so unless you have a place to stay that night (and not driving 13 hours to the next show cause tour routing is not necessarily designed to make sense for traveling in comfort), you get to love wet wipes and stuff like that. Staying healthy - some call it ""Bus AIDS"" but you can imagine what happens to that bus or van crammed with people when one of them catches a cold or flu :( (always keep hand sanitizer on you!). And diet - to eat and not get fat on the road without blowing a hole in your food budget is really difficult to do unless you're creative, too. (Ask veterans of touring for tips to survive a bit better on the road).",387

Honestly, from looking at how the media portrays marriage, it seems like you're not supposed to have sex anymore afterwards or that it's really not an important part of marriage. That was for young single people. So when people have unsatisfactory sex lives, they often don't think of it as something they need to work on that could end the marriage if it isn't addressed. They just shut up about it because a lot of people will think they are jerks for complaining about such a thing. Hell, even their own partners often shut them down like they are some perverted horny beast for complaining about the frequency and quality of sex. I've literally been in a relationship where I tried to bring up sex and she called into question whether I even loved her, like if you love someone sex doesn't matter anymore.

"To be honest, she was worse when she was drunk. Now that she doesn't drink, she's only relatively annoying. We just don't talk about anything personal and we're good as acquaintances.

 The few times I've tried to bring it up have basically led to me crying in my boyfriend's bed while he cradled me because as much as I don't want to acknowledge it, it still hurts. I found out recently that my brother did know, but thought I was lying because my mother said so. Because of my personality of being a little asshole at the time, I was branded a liar by my entire family. The thing is I don't lie, and I've never had any desire to, and it really sucked because my own brother didn't even believe me. 

For a while it was just something that happened and then when I started getting into relationships, it really reared its ugly head. Still not completely ""okay"", but getting better.",221

"I'm not a Kennedy and supposedly was the only non-Kennedy on the hill at the time. It's a long story that in hindsight, I probably should have sold to a tabloid.  My wife was in the hospital dying and I just wanted to ski with my friend in Colorado to be one with nature. I watched a him slam face first into a tree, last run of the day, playing a silly game of catch the bottle. His last words were likely ""I got it!"" There was blood all over the snow, his face looked like hamburger meat, and then I told the ski patrol where to find him.  I was high on coke and waiting for my friend to get off work so we could party for NYE and when I got to the bottom of the hill and went to return my skis at the Little Nell Hotel where all the Kennedy's stay, his sister came running in with his skis crying that he had died. I saw his ski tips she threw on the counter and they looked like shredded pork.  The next day I was on a pay phone (yes it was a long time ago) and a reporter overhead me talking to my friend. The reporter abruptly interrupts my conversation to say, ""there was only one non-Kennedy person on the hill at the time, are you saying that was you!??"".  Again, I was coked out, my wife was dying in the hospital and all I could think was that the very last thing I needed in my life was the Kennedy family on my ass! So I said 'I have nothing to say"". I think there was a photographer in their ski group of 20 or so people and they must have studied the photographs because believe it or not, there were two Kennedy kids (nephews/cousins??) who I spoke to on the hill 2 minutes after it happened. They were walking uphill without skis to look for him just as the ski patrol came to me on a snow mobile - that's when I told all 3 where he was. The next day, I ran into those same 2 kids at a Jerry Garcia shrine in the aspen trees (it's a thing) and they recalled who I was (even though I wore totally different clothes) and thanked me. They asked 'did you tell anyone what you saw?'. I answered, I just work for the Walt Disney company (true), who could I possibly tell? They laughed and a few weeks later sent me pictures we took and they asked me if I could get their screenplay read!  I said to myself, jeez, even a Kennedy can't get a break in Hollywood. Oddly enough, the whole world knew who it was before Aspen knew.  I just knew I saw a dude die on a tree -- didn't know who it was until I watched CNN the next morning. 

EDIT: 

Thanks for the gold!  I was not expecting this kind of response, but I went out tonight after a crap day, and was happy to come home and see this. Ironically, I live in CO now. And thanks for the many condolences.  And I understand how douchy it sounds to go skiing as my wife lay in the hospital. As I said, I kept this story short. She was in and out of hospitals and psyche wards for two years and I was beginning to break. I cried every day for two years and then was a wreck for a decade after she died, was drinking myself to near death because there was nothing I could do to help her because her mind literally deteriorated. She was not in imminent fear of death at that particular time I went to aspen. She and my family knew where I was, and she simply lost her mind and could not make the most basic decision like ""should I eat an omelette for breakfast or a phone book?"". Honestly, I asked her that once!  It was the most helpless feeling imaginable. That is a whole different story I'll tell another time. Like some have said, until you're in that position of dealing with someone with a chronic mental disorder, cancer, disease or whatever... you too might want to go skiing and get wasted rather than go insane yourself.

Fat and Furious III: Triggered,438
"I told this story before, but here it goes. 

When I was in high school, one of the prettiest girls in the entire school was in my class. Her name was Débora (I'm from Brazil, that's how we spell it). Where I live there are all sorts of pretty girls for all tastes, but I had never seen anything like her. I'm pretty sure she had one of those things people have that make them have different eye colors in each eye, which by the way, are to this day, the single most beautiful thing I have seen in a human body. She also had this cute look, like she wasn't really paying attention to the world around her and how people would always turn their heads when she passed.

Basically, despite being incredibly pretty and desired by pretty much every guy - and some chicks - in our school, she was pretty down-to-earth, simple and nice. We only became friends at first because she was friends with another girl who was friends with me, and since we started sitting together, we talked a lot. She was very interested on the fact that I had learned English by myself, even though I was only 14 and had no help whatsoever. I was proud of that, but at the same time, understood why people didn't like me to be, but she didn't care. She seemed more interested in what I had to say than I was in her beauty. 

She would always follow me to the library, even though she didn't really read any books. She would just stay there with me, asking me questions every now and then and talking about silly stuff. To be honest, I didn't think she was very interesting intellectually speaking, but I liked how she treated me and so we became very good friends very fast.

No matter where I was, she'd try to find me and be with me. She'd be with some of her friends in a corner and as soon as I showed up, she'd abandon everyone to talk to me. Things changed a little after I made a drawing of us and gave her as a gift. Not a very good one, but slightly cool. Good enough that she started to be even more intimate with me.

Now, I was about that age when I didn't even know what sex really was besides what porn and ignorant conversations with other 14 year-olds had taught me. I felt attracted to her. Physically, and that's it. To me, however, it was so impossible, I didn't even consider the possibility of her liking me more than a friend. I dreamed and fantasized about it, sure, but I wasn't really serious about any consideration.

Gradually, she started to hug me, kiss me and even say things that, now, I know to be indirectly saying: ""do you want to try and have a relationship?"". It probably wouldn't have worked. I mean, the amount of dudes who used to hit on her was absurd. I'm talking pretty much all the guys in our school, people on the streets, adults, teachers, relatives. She'd always talk to me about that, saying that she was scared of being attacked sometimes. Even this one criminal from a favela around became interested on her - the guy was 30 something and she was 14, like me.

I spent the entire year being fed many hints to her interest. Never acted on any of them. The last one, was maybe the most obvious, the one that made me think about it seriously and consider the possibility, and also the one that scared me to death of it, because I thought I could never be with a girl like that, even if she wanted to be with me. 

In our last day of school, she came to me while I was talking to some guys at the cafeteria and just sat on my lap. The guys slowly went away and left me alone with her. She told me she was going to miss spending so much time with me and then just stayed there for a good 20 minutes or so. I never felt that way again. I was so terrified, I wanted her to stay there, but at the same time, to go away, because I was really really nervous. I'm pretty sure I kind of blacked out in a way, because I can clearly remember not being able to think about anything really, and focusing solely on every inch of my body that she was pressing against.

Once that moment was over, we talked a little on her way to the bus. I was very poor and had no way to keep in touch with her. She also lived very far away, otherwise I'm pretty sure I'd have tried to keep in touch. She tried herself, visiting me at least twice after that, but never touching me again. I guess that, somehow, she thought I wasn't interested on her, even though, I'm pretty sure this is not conceivable. 

I think she was not the love of my life or anything and in retrospect, the only thing I really enjoyed about being with her was the attention of someone as admired as she was - yes, I was a douche, and also 14, who isn't a douche at that age? -. Still, I regret not having the experience, which, in a way, I think it would have been just too much for little old me.",229

"When I was a boy about 10 years old, one day I was riding my bike along a busy road. An older boy stepped in front of me, stopping me, and took over riding with me on the back.

I told nobody about this, not for another 10 years. That's had some lifelong repercussions, I think. It affected how I felt about myself, sex, and other relationships. It was a mistake not to talk about it and seek help. In my catholic family, sex was taboo, and I felt as though I had transgressed and couldn't talk about it. I am not making the same mistake with my children.

"A good friend of mine's family rented a house to Lindsay Lohan's parents (wish I had documentation to prove this, but this was a while ago—like after Parent Trap but before Mean Girls or something—and it was near or in Huntington, Long Island, if that helps at all. I can probably find the house on Street View if anyone wants to see).

And the family found out later that they did this frequently.",1141

"Probably not as bad as other stories in this thread, but my girlfriend and I went away for a week and a half, and a friend of ours volunteered to housesit and take care of our pets (two cats and two lizards). We made sure they knew what to do and wrote a care sheet for each animal, and what they needed to do to keep the animals healthy while we were away. Feed the cats, clean their litter, chop up veggies for the lizards and feed them bugs, and give the lizard a quick bath if she poops because she'll definitely run around in it. 

So after we ran our friend through our daily routine to care for our pets, we said our goodbyes and went away. When we came back, our apartment looked nice, but there was a HEAVY cat piss/cat shit smell all over the apartment, and when I checked on my lizard, she had shit all over her underside. Not.  Cool. Bearded dragons have salmonella in their feces, and this meant she ran a risk of getting   very sick if she ran over her food. We ended up having to take her to the vet for a $300 vet bill for tail rot and to check for food poisoning. The cat litter was literally solid. When confronted, he said he had just forgotten to clean it once before he left, but it looked exactly like a week and a half worth of two cats peepoos. Our one cat was so fed up with the amount of peepoos in the litter that we saw him peeing on the floor, which has never once happened before or since this incident. 

It was clear to us that he did next to nothing to care for our pets like he promised he would. He just volunteered to stay in our apartment  because it was an hour closer to his new job, and completely used us. We used to be great friends, but I haven't seen them more than once in the two years since this incident. Hard to trust someone after they pull a stunt like that.

Edit: no I did not go after them for the vet bill. I yelled at them when we got back, and they knew they fucked up. I knew I wouldn't get the money from them because they're stubborn as fuck. Just took it as a down payment on not really being friends anymore. This whole situation is why I pay professionals to care for my animals whenever I go out of town now. ",2451

"I was the IT Director for a small software company working 80-100 hour weeks trying  to meet the recent demand that the owner had placed on the team. I woke up one morning expecting to see a confirmation email that my direct deposit (my paycheck) had cleared my bank account, but instead had an all-employee email from the owner saying that paychecks were being withheld until production goals were met. From my bed a few minutes later, I changed every password in the entire environment, shut down every server, and even changed the code on the magnetic door lock to enter the server room. The production environment that customers access as well as the development environment that employees use were all completely down. The owner probably called me 100 times easy that hour. After saving several incriminating voicemails and texts that I received from him, I finally returned his call and informed him that I no longer worked for him. Then we negotiated how much he would pay me to turn his company back on (including the original pay check). I got paid, did my part of the agreement and went on my way. The company was bankrupt three months later.

Edit: I was aware that what I did was potentially illegal, but I had previous information that would have ended the owner's marriage, and the texts he sent me were violent and threatening. He knew he fucked up and he complied rather quickly. I could have wiped every server clean and purged all the backups, but then he would have been sued by all of the customers and I would have certainly been included in that lawsuit. Instead, I just shut everything down and locked the door so they couldn't be powered back on without my permission.

These are well off people who are upper income range so it's not the village or anything, just to set the tone correctly.

There had been events the day before the actual wedding ceremony, which about 500+ people attended and of course people talk, hence word got out...

the evening of the wedding  a group of people showed up and litterally blocked the street so the groom couldn't come to the wedding venue.


The groom had been banging (dating) a female of said blockade family under the promise of getting married. Even introducing himself to her parents and family, planning a future date for his parents to meet hers. Mind you all (500+) the guests had arrived and witnessed this. 

For about an hour there was a stand off and the information got back to the venue/ bride and her family and they called off the wedding. The guests were half in shock, half trying to eat and drink as much as they could before the inevitable cancellation happened.

The bride's family actually took the matter to court (expenses of the wedding and such) and the guy $ettled out of court with them.

You know, there was an [Atlantic article](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/sexual-abuse-victims-obesity/420186/) recently detailing some interesting research about obesity. I'll summarize a bit of it so people don't have to click through. When surveyed, over half of the patients at a weight-loss clinic confirmed that they had experienced some childhood sexual abuse. And that's just one type of trauma — god knows what other skeletons are hiding in the closet. Childhood trauma increases the risk of obesity by up to 100%. One theory is that it's a subconscious defense mechanism — you're less likely to have to deal with sexual advances if nobody wants you because you're fat.

Among women hospitalized for psychiatric problems after bariatric surgery, *73%* reported childhood sexual abuse. Bariatric surgery shrinks your stomach, which means you can't eat as much, which means your coping mechanism is gone. One woman lost 93 pounds and was admitted to a psych ward 5 times in a year. Not a coincidence.

Now, the plural of anecdote isn't data, but I'll summarize my own experience based on a few of my overweight friends. Off the top of my head, one was molested by her father when she was a kid. One was neglected by her drug-addled dad and had an undiagnosed anxiety disorder for years — she used to sleep outside the door to her parents' room because something convinced her that her mother would stop breathing in the night if she wasn't nearby. One was a closeted lesbian who grew up thinking something was wrong with her, kissed her first girl and dropped forty pounds. One was severely depressed since childhood, and he only started losing weight once they put him on antidepressants (a full quarter of the population deals with mental illness at any given time, and depression is among the most common, just to give you a sense of scale). Do I know some fat people who don't seem to have mental issues? Yes. But not many.

Now, are these people's obesity issues directly related to their emotional issues? Maybe, maybe not. But nothing happens in a vacuum. I think of my friend who was molested — violently — by her father, and I think, how much of a choice is it for her? 

Maybe you don't know people's internal lives as well as you think you do.",210

"&gt; alcohol and tobacco related accidents or diseases kill more people a year than most ""illegal"" drugs ever have

Could a counter-argument to this be that perhaps there aren't as many people in this country who do cocaine or heroin as there are who drink?  I'd imagine the kill count for alcohol is higher because virtually every adult in America drinks alcohol, and a shit ton of Americans drink to get drunk.  Also, if we just compare two substances like cocaine and alcohol, I'd say, relatively, cocaine is immensely harder to get than alcohol, just because you can go to countless liquor stores and buy alcohol legally.  And so all of these things considered, I'd assume alcohol consumption completely eclipses cocaine consumption.

[edit:  and this completely disregards the tobacco, which is still used *very* widely today.]

I actually believe in legalizing (most) illegal drugs; probably just things like weed, mushrooms, mdma, etc (but perhaps excluding things like meth or crack, which are harmful to society in general).  I also agree that alcohol is much more dangerous than weed, and that virtually the only threat weed poses is making you less capable of making well advised decisions and some motor-skill difficulties while high.

Bride and groom have been together for a long time, and have been trying to have children for years with no luck. They get engaged and begin planning this massive wedding when they find out that she is finally pregnant!

The day of the wedding comes when the bride is about 7 months along in her pregnancy. Everyone is having a blast at the reception and then they realize that none* of them has seen the bride or groom for a while. They go looking for them, with no luck.

A few minutes later the groom comes out, carrying his new bride in her completely blood-soaked wedding gown. He carries her out to a waiting ambulance that he had apparently called from the bathroom he had been in with her.

The bride gives birth to a baby that is very premature, but alive. The bride suffers a massive amount of blood loss, and is unconscious. The baby is taken to a nearby hospital that is apparently better-equipped for preemies. The mother is taken to a different hospital, which apparently is pretty far away. 

The groom spends his wedding day going back and forth between the two hospitals. When the bride wakes up, she insists on going to the other hospital to see her baby. The first pictures of them as a family are of them looking down at their teeny baby, with the bride still wearing her tiara.

This was several months ago now, and the baby is home and doing well.",205

Finally, I realized I just disagreed with almost everything they stood for. 

It may sound trite, but several of John Scalzi's articles, while they didn't change my mind, they allowed me to turn loose of some of the libertarian ideals I had embraced and be comfortable calling myself a liberal.

"Short answer: Yes.  

Honest answer: It's possible but it makes up at most 25% of the time we claim to be thinking about nothing. Scenarios in which ""*Oh, nothing...*"" are as follows...  

* It actually is nothing. It was something but we finished thinking about it or got bored thinking about it and we are just staring blankly waiting for a new thought to happen.  

* It is really something, but... Our thoughts have crawled down a deep dark rabbit hole and it is only when you ask the question we think about what we were thinking and are so embarrassed/disgusted/horrified with ourselves we retreat to the safety net of ""*oh, nothing...*""  

* It is really something, but... we started thinking about it last Tuesday and have been playing it out in our minds every dump and/or quiet period at work ever since: We are now to the semi-finals of Spiderman, The Predator, Gambit from the X-Men, and Jesus in a Roman-esque gladatorial knock-out tournament and whilst we deem the conversation about finding the greatest hero/villian ever worth sharing we are worried that a) We'll have to go all the way back to the original knock-out stages to justify arriving at our final four, or worse still b) you'll say: ""But what about [*Insert character weird forgotten to include*] how did they do?"" and we'll back to square one... Some thoughts have already had to much time invested in them to share.  

* It is really something, but... it involves the difference biggness between how your ass looked in that dress and how big we said it was, or how hot a woman we could make if we Frankensteined females from your family or best friends and used only their body parts... you know random thoughts there is no possible good outcome from sharing.

Dr. Connors looks into the symbiote and learns that it amplifies their characteristics. So you know how when Peter is Spider-Man, and he's throwing out all these one-liners as he's dodging bullets and knocking out badguys? Alright, imagine that cranked to 11, then keep that persona on Peter Parker, who looks like a character from Silicon Valley.

No, everyone's like ""Dude, who the fuck is this weird asshole?"" This is like if Peter was drunk, but kept his mental faculties. In fact, I'm sure there's a good argument in there somewhere about how the symbiote could be about substance abuse and how your self-perception changes.

"The IT director was an absolute fucking psycho &amp; used to do this to people he was concerned were clever than he was. 

He sets the Targets just very slightly above what's the record over a period of 4 weeks to a month. Best case scenario employee gets fed up of working like a lunatic &amp; doing so much overtime &amp; quits. Worst case he's acquired grounds to fire the employee. 

Here's some other shit he pulled:

*  Said 'it's in the next sprint' to every failed target of his own over 3 years. 

* Spent 2 years, and approaching ten million dollars building a website which once launched cut the company's sales by two thirds. 

* Fired someone for writing a bad review on glassdoor, then wrote a review of himself, and asked explicitly for the whole office to write positive reviews about him.   

* According to his Linkedin profile he got his first 'Vice President' position at the age of 14. 

* He Spent $10,000 for a wooden shed to go in the office. 

* Introdued 'classy Fridays' to the office, meaning you had to wear a tuxedo or a dress so you could drink wine all day. NOT BEER though, &amp; guess why? His wife was in some sort of pyramid wine scheme which meant he could bill the company for gallons &amp; gallons of wine.

* Would tell DIRECTORS that things were working when they obviously were broken 'It's working for me'. 

* Cheated on his wife with a low ranking member of staff who worked in the retail department, &amp; then stopped right before the action started in his hotel room by telling her 'I can't believe I'm about to sleep with a 'shop girl'

There's loads more. This guy was the biggest piece of shit in the history of time. 

*edited to add further crimes: 

* He would refuse to give you a job description at any point of your employment. If he didn't like you, he would then ask, what tasks are you currently assigned to? You'd email back. He'd then forward this email to HR claiming the position was redundant because the tasks performed didn't match a job description the employee had never seen. 

* He fired a graphic designer with zero warning by discovering that he had used an image from wikipedia. Which had a 'creative commons license' rather than a commercial license. (Said image was washed out in the background and under text). He then googled the maximum fine for breach of copyright, emailed it to the CEO saying ""this is what this guy could cost the company,"" and fired him the next day.

* He persuaded a guy (Married with 2 kids) to move 2,800 miles across the country by being sickeningly nice, making out they were going to be best buddies, telling him how great it was going to be working there &amp; said *anything* to get this dude to take the job. He took it. On his first having moved his family new guy asks this cunt director, ""let's go for a beer after work,"" Director replies. ""I'm sorry, I don't socialise with work people"".

* He also relocated an entire team of 8 people to a different country, making them emigrate, then made them all redundant 9 months later. 

* In email marketing, he would crop images so tightly you couldn't see what it was anymore. Claimed it was part of an A/B test, and his test had won every time. We never, *ever* saw the results. 

* When challenged, he would talk for as long as possible, without taking a breath, in a monotone voice, for up to 5 minutes at a time, until you'd lost all thread of the conversation. A surprisingly effective defence mechanism as you couldn't build any momentum &amp; meetings took forever.

* If he knew he was going to be criticised in a meeting He'd schedule it for half an hour, and would then spend the first 15 minutes introducing everyone on the call, followed by reading out the invitation, then would claim he couldn't hear because his connection was bad. 

* Let's say for argument's sake this company we worked for sells books. Well, the Director of Books is a world leading expert, who has made the company millions of dollars, and is completely irreplaceable. Having been there under 3 years IT cunt demands that this guy has 'no input in marketing' (of his own products) and requests for him to be fired. 

* After he was fired, he asked a fellow director that he himself had fired, for a reference. The text back said 'Fuck no.'

* The company website had a forum attached to it, which had been posted on for a number of years. He bought another large niche forum, bought its owner a house, moved him across the country &amp; gave him a job (again, all with company funds.) So now the website has an active, specialist, populated community. IT Director's next decision is to flip a switch, and make everyone's user ID THEIR REAL NAMES. Can you imagine doing that on Reddit? Well, we didn't have a forum or a community after that, only tumbleweed. The guy who's forum had been bought &amp; fucked was also fired. 

There's still more but I'm tired. If people want me to keep going I'll carry on tomorrow!

"As an atheist at heart, but raised a Christian, this always scared the crap out of me. 

How can I (my soul, my consciousness - whatever you want to call it) just cease to be?

It's the main thing that kept me *somewhat* religious into my adulthood. I wanted to retain that idea that when I die, my soul/consciousness would remain even thought my body had died. I wanted to believe that, so I accepted all the other aspects of religion because I couldn't come to terms with the alternative - death = eternal nothingness.

But presumably I didn't exist before I was born.

And then somehow, one day, I came into being.

I believe that life on Earth is just an ongoing chemical reaction. Over time that chemical reaction became so complex that where there was once nothing, there are now components of this chemical reaction that have souls/consciousness.

Consciousness arose through complex chemical reaction. Your consciousness is just a manifestation of a physical chemical reaction going on inside your brain.

And it isn't always the same chemicals. Over the course of your lifespan, some chemicals will be replaced by new chemicals. So it isn't like your soul/consciousness is even tied to a certain set of chemicals. 

I don't fully understand how it happens. I'm certainly not a brain expert by any sense. But I think it's pretty clear that everybody's soul came into being due to a physical process - no magic or mysticism required. 

So why can't that process happen again? After the chemical process that currently creates your consciousness cease to exist, why can't another batch of similar chemicals conspire to create another instance of the same consciousness.

Of course, it wouldn't remember this instance. Memories are clearly recorded into chemicals inside your brain and there's no reason to think they'd survive into the next incarnation of *you*.

It seems crazy to think that in a nearly infinite universe, that the only time chemicals would come together to make *you* (your soul/consciousness/whatever) would be this one single time.

It isn't much consolation. It's just a lot of guessing. And if you prefer to believe in mysticism or magic, then that's fine. 

But if you don't believe in any of that stuff and are scared of death because you don't believe in afterlife, it seems almost unscientific to think that this one instance is the only time *you* will exist. To think it happened because of a chemical process but in an infinite universe it can't happen again is almost somehow granting some kind of magical status to your soul.",107

"Religion.   While I am not particularly religious myself, I have come to appreciate the positive effects that religion plays on the evolution of humankind.  

Before you start quoting the countless atrocities committed in the name of God(s), consider the big picture.  Religion provides a moral framework for society.  That moral framework is adopted by many people and it continues to be relevant over thousands of years.  Golden Rule kind of stuff... Treat others how you expect to be treated.  Assume good intentions.  Be excellent to one another.  Teach your buddy to fish so you have someone to hold your beer while you reel in a whopper.  That kind of thing.

The rest of it is about controlling populations.  That may sound harsh and evil, but it is an important part of society.  Individuals simply cannot produce the amazing accomplishments of a group.  Social order helps to produce big results and preserve knowledge for future generations to build upon.

Humans are unique and random creatures.  There will always be pride, greed, sloth, envy, lust, gluttony, wrath and not cleaning up after oneself in a public restroom.  A universally approachable and adoptable moral code is a good way to understand that reality.  A solid understanding of human nature will help us grow beyond it.",107

"Bear with me, I'm about to talk about Morrowind. 

You gotta have a standard by which to measure your strength. If you just get handed this unbreakable sword that kills everything in 3 hits, and then right before it would be useless you get an essentially equivalent weapon against tougher enemies right as you're about to face said tougher enemies, when you have to option to resurrect on the spot if your health goes to zero or like fight as a ghost to reclaim your body then what's the point? Where's the scale? What are you doing?

Morrowind, if you stick with it, you go from zero to hero over the course of a very long adventure. If you stick out the outdated fighting mechanics, if you accept them, then eventually you master them and then you feel like a badass. When you've gone from a literal nobody with the clothes on your back and 87 gold coins and getting killed by mudcrabs and scrub bandits with fucking chitin daggers to the godkilling Incarnate of Prophecy, the master of every faction, fucking casting spells that do 100 points fire/frost/shock/poison/drain health in a 100 foot radius *and lasts for 10 seconds* you are a fucking badass. You are the fucking *master*. One shotting things that used to drop you in a second. And then you get fucked up by those fucking level 90 werewolves in Hircine's Maze. (Speaking of which, that dude was a joke compared to his minions)

Does Morrowind make me feel like the biggest badass? If it doesn't then it certainly gives me the biggest sense of accomplishment in a game. ",194

"Keeping your knives sharp is easy but most people don't know how. A lot of people own a honing steel but only use it when their knives start to dull, maybe once a month or less which won't work. A honing steel is designed to be used **every time you use the knife**, six strokes each side before you use it is sufficient. It won't wear the blade down because, unless the edge of the blade is worn or damaged, it shouldn't remove any metal (that's why it's made out of the same material as the blade. Ceramic or diamond honing rods on the other hand are designed to shave a small amount of metal off the edge).

A proper steel just straightens, polishes and smoothes down the edge. It's a bit like ironing the creases out of a shirt. If you are unsure of the technique there are plenty of tutorials online. Using a steel will keep your sharp knives sharp. If a knife starts to dull the steel will no longer do the job and you will need to use a whetstone or oil stone to grind a new edge (once again plenty of tutorials online).",213

- She posts about how fat she looks in her pictures where she is obviously skinny as hell. She recently lost like 40lbs because her and her bf got into drugs. Neither of them have a job, she's always posting ""we need a place to stay hmu!"" AND PEOPLE OFFER. They always end up kicked out not long after moving in.
- Posts pictures of herself crying all over Instagram.
- Posts shit about sex and tags her boyfriend for the world to see, as if anybody wants to. She has a pic on Instagram of them in the shower making out... Can't see anything because it's at a weird angle, thank fucking God.
- Posts angled shots of herself while naked so you can tell she is but you can't see anything, saying how she's so confident now even though other times she claims she's fat and ugly. 
- Posts side by side comparison pics saying how happy she is because of her weight loss, once again even though she always claims she's gross and fat.
- The other day she posted about how she wishes she had a girl best friend to send nudes to and some guy was like ""lol what"" she's like ""UR A GUY U DON'T UNDERSTAND!"" I'm a girl, we don't do that shit lol. At least most of us don't?
- She recently posted a screenshot of cervical cancer symptoms (some very gross) saying ""Omg I have all of these!"" She went to the hospital, they sent her for a colposcopy or whatever it is when they take a little piece of your cervix for testing and posted pics of herself there, captioned ""getting a pap test!""... The morning she got the results, she posted "" Today is the day I find out if I have cancer..."" She doesn't have cancer, and I'm unfortunately still wondering why the hell she has smelly, strange coloured discharge... TMI.
- She posted a dark pic where you couldn't really make out what was happening, tagged her bf and captioned it ""they'll never know eh babe ;)"" but it was deleted pretty quick, probably realized how dumb she looked. 
- She always makes sure she or a friend of hers takes videos for Instagram and Facebook whenever she gets drunk. You always see videos of her downing shots with friends.
- I don't know if it was really her cousin, but anyway somebody I know was murdered in December and ever since, she's always posting these big paragraphs on her profile or on his about this and that, saying she's doing this and that for him, etc. ALWAYS makes sure she mentions the word cousin somewhere in it.

He's worth $50-60 million, and I always found envelopes of cash on my desk when he had me do things that were less than legal. He enjoyed guns, hiding cash, steroids, coke, and hookers (I didn't provide any of these, but I was told to look the other way). I was usually able to, but over time, I got to know his wife and three kids. Over my time there, the steroids and painkillers made him paranoid and detached. He threatened to have me killed if I didn't help him transport 60-70 assault rifles from his storage facility to his mistress' house (who was a coked-up, Orange County-housewife, fake tanned, cunt). I explained that I had a problem driving around with all of these guns. A week later, he had hip surgery and needed to be in the hospital for recovery. I drove to his house and told his wife (who was oblivious to his shenanigans) about the drugs, mistress, hookers, and money laundering. I promptly received an e-mail from him that said, ""Effective immediately, your employment is terminated.""

I think one of the thing that plagues many people with overeating is their connection to an agricultural heritage. Breakfasts at one time were huge, bacon-grease laden affairs meant to sustain you through the punishing labor of farm life, from 5am cow milking till an equally huge lunch then a 'supper' at 5pm. 

Our whole notion of breakfast in this country -- especially the midwest -- is still centered around hard manual labor. Ditto the other meals of the day. Add in the cold weather and bulky clothes, and you have a recipe for obesity and general thickness.

I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose.  I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.

"My wife used to have this trainwreck of a white trash girl working for her - you know the kind, who takes absolutely no responsibility for anything that happens to her. 

Well, I reluctantly agreed against my better judgment because I try to be a nice, generous guy. 

Before she came, my wife laid up a few ground rules: 

- Your kids cannot stay here; we don't have the room. They were with the father anyway.

- You buy your own food; we cannot afford to feed you. If we cook, however, and there's extra, we will of course not deny you.

- We are not your taxi service and you cannot drive our cars; we cannot afford to take the risk since we only had liability insurance. 

- This will be a very temporary arrangement. As in less than a month. You can get your shit sorted out in that time. 

She packed my wife's car with her shit and tried to *move in* to my office, while complaining that I hadn't bought a bed for her to sleep on (gave her an air mattress). 

She was filthy. *Filthy*. 

She ate all of our food during the times we were gone, and made sure to only eat the expensive stuff like milk and steak. 

When they were at work, her shift ended before my wife's. She took her car without permission and only called after the fact to ""tell her what was up"". 

I came home late to her and her brood in my house making messes and breaking shit. (I'm pretty sure shit was stolen too.) They were eating all of our food and at the time we were on a very strict budget. 

She told me that she wanted her kids to stay with us from then on because she wanted them close to her and didn't want them at dad's house (never mind that dad was 100% supporting them and not receiving any substantive assistance from her and that they all had their own rooms at his house - let's squeeze into my apartment instead) and couldn't the youngest sleep in the crib with my daughter? 

Her oldest looked visibly mortified to be in the situation, so I guess dad was doing something right. 

Anyway, she had driven my wife's car all over town (without permission) picking up her kids and all that and then later disclosed to us that she didn't have a drivers' license, so if ANYTHING had happened, we would have been screwed. 

I. Lost. My. Shit. 

Didn't even say a word; just asked the kids to get into the car and informed everyone that they were going home. My wife drove them home with her with to provide directions. 

Took all her filthy shit and stacked it in the garage. When she got back she got pissed and tried to manipulate my wife. I had to tell her that tonight was the last night and I will hold your shit for a few days but I am also not a storage facility so figure it out. Then of course nothing was her fault and everything was because I was an evil cunt. 

Best thing? All this went down within 3 days of her coming. It took her 48 hours to wear out her welcome, 72 to be out. Holy shit.

"I was in sixth grade (1996). I was on a science class field trip to one of the nearby rivers where we were building 55-gallon drum pontoon boats for... science reasons. Anyway, my dad shows up about 10 in the morning and tells the teacher I have an appointment I need to go to, *urgently*. I wasn't aware of any such appointment, but when your dad says you have one, *you have one*. So I leave with him and ask him WTF we're doing; he simply says, ""You'll see.""

So we ride on his motorcycle for a while, and eventually I realize we're at the airport (Changi). But not the airport entrance, the back side. He pulls off into a grassy area next to a fence overlooking the main runway and pulls out a picnic blanket (blue tarp), a pair of binoculars, and a then-new-and-awesome laser pointer. He was very proud of and jealously guarded his big bulky fold-out laser pointer, so by now I was suuuuuper confused and a little concerned.

That is, until about 10 minutes later, when an airplane landed. But not any airplane. It was the Northrop B-2, an aircraft that had only been announced to the world some six months prior. My tiny little mind was ***BLOWN***. We were honestly a good mile away from it, and obviously we weren't the focus of the visit so we used the binoculars to get good looks at it, and like little budding terrorist idiots we shined the laser pointer at it to see if it would reflect at all (""science!"") (it did not, even though it reflected off the concrete directly below it). 

Eventually, it took off again and left, and we and the other ~50 assorted people started rolling up our tarps and heading out. Except, I'm guessing the crew saw us with our faces plastered up against the fence, because a few minutes later as we were finishing packing, that motherfucker flew *right over our heads*, at no more than 500ft. The worst part was, not a single one of us heard him coming. He was right over our heads by the time anybody noticed. 

It was the most glorious thing young me had ever seen.

When we were finally done and riding back out, my dad looks me right in the eye and says, ""Son, if Mom asks you what you did today, you had a great time building boats, right?""

One of the best memories I ever had growing up. I'm sure my mom knew, but she knew better than to ask lol

Edit: There was nobody in the plane when we were shining a laser at it, and we were just shining it at the fuselage to see if we could see the dot. And frankly, being the mid 90s, this was both a) not a powerful laser by any definition - about the same power as the average cat toy laser, and b) way before shining lasers into plane cockpits was a thing. We probably would not have attempted this nowadays...

When people got the invite, they glanced at it and assumed he was marrying the long-term girlfriend, got to the chapel and were like ""who the fuck is this?""

It was an insanely expensive wedding with probably 200 people but basically not everyone was treated the same - I found out at the reception that only some people were given +1s. I wasn't one of them, so my then-fiance had to stay at home while I went to this wedding where I knew absolutely no one. (I was okay with it because I thought it was a small wedding but then I got there and started talking to people and we realized some folks were allowed to bring dates and others weren't. Awkward.) 

The bartender spent the entire reception trying to hit on the groom's 14-year-old sister by plying her with alcohol, and I had assigned seating at a table full of the groom's douchebag college bros. 

Just to top it off, they did the whole ""take pictures between the ceremony and the reception"" thing, which is fine, except it took FOUR HOURS and they didn't serve any food until the wedding party arrived.

"I want to follow up on this one to clarify, because it is what I was going to comment.

In the US, we have a progressive marginal tax rate. This means that when you enter a higher income bracket, you will be taxed at a higher rate *only to the extent that your income exceeds the lower tax bracket.*

I will provide a simple example. Let's say that you make $21K. Let's say that the income tax has a flat rate of 10% and that the income tax for income of $20K and over is 15%

**The myth**: Income tax = 15% * 21K = 3,150, which means that your net income is now only $17,850. If you had only made $20K, you would been better off, because your tax would have only been $2,000, meaning your net income would have been $18,000!

**The reality**: Income tax is 10% * $20K + 15% * ($21K - $20K) = 2,150. Therefore, your end income is $18,850, which is more than if you had made $20K

"TL;DR: I quit my online community manager job, my loyal community got up in arms about it and harassed the company demanding to know what happened to me. Almost no work got done that day as everyone was watching the boards and much of the community changed their profile pictures to mine. The company went under. 

I was an online community manager for a Facebook games company, we had one pretty successful title and several others that were less so. I really enjoyed my job and I was good at it. My community loved me, and I them. Our backend wasn't as stable or robust as it really needed to be so there was often fires to put out on the discussion boards about loss items, currency or game progress, ect., and I was the fire extinguisher. (Example: One time we changed how we stored user's data and lost all the data for a large chunk of our users and they couldn't be backed up, so our support team ended up getting weeks behind in tickets trying to restore accounts to what they once were.)

Anyway, the owners were trying to grow quick so they could sell before FB games really started to fade away. They made lots of changes and decisions and hired a new CEO. Which is all fine unless you're the one with a smile on your face and a target on your back to the public and you have to tell the users things. So I got a bit annoyed and spoke up. Surprisingly, the CEO wanted to listen to me so I went in his office and essentially bitched for a good 90 minutes. I was really impressed by him wanting to listen to lowly me, and he actually took notes. I didn't leave because of him.

I left because of the owners. They were out of the country at the time of the changes announcement and found out that I was talking to the CEO. Not 10 minutes after I left his office I was called into a meeting with my direct boss. He told me that the company was unhappy with my work, and that I really need to make improvements or I was being demoted back to customer support. News out of fucking no where. I was at that position nearly a year and had only one instance where I handled something poorly and was talked to about it. This was one of the owners trying to put me in my place. They wouldn't fire me just yet for fear that my SO, one of their senior developers, would walk. 

So that pissed me off. I took the night to think on it and in the morning I quit before most people were in the office. I asked if I could say goodbye to my community and was denied. So I deliberately deactivated my forums account, and deleted my work Facebook account (with several thousand friends, all players of the game who are used to seeing my profile picture as being first in their friends list whenever they logged in) and went home.

The icing on the cake was that that day was their 1 year anniversary celebration/content release of their biggest/successful game. The boards exploaded! ""Where is she?"" ""What happened to Zeckos!"" ""Screw your game anniversary, bring back Zeckos!"" They were so mad because the I just disappeared and the company wouldn't say anything about it. The users ended up getting the office phone number (wasn't really public) and calling from all over the world to try to find out what happened to me. They bombarded support and any company email they could find. The boards exploaded with ""Bring back Zeckos!"" threads and so, so many users changed their profile/avatar pictures to mine so my image was EVERYWHERE! Work ceased in the office that day as everyone was watching the boards and how the company was trying to handle it. And I watched from home, eating comfort foods and crying. I loved that job and my community but I wasn't going to be bullied into a lower position for having a negative opinion of the changes.

In the end, their year anniversary release was a bust, the company went under less than 2 years later, and the owners fled the country. I like to think my leaving helped set them on the final path to running that company into the ground. ",184

(Word limit strikes again... here's the rest.)


He pulls the car into another neighborhood a couple miles down the road to do the paperwork. Evidently, his timing was immaculate, as several XPD officers arrived at my home moments after he pulled away; shrewd move on his part to get me out of there before anyone else could get involved. *I was HIS trophy today.* 

We sat on the side of the road in that random neighborhood for about 20 minutes, and he talked shit to me the entire time. He briefly glanced up from his computer to look at me in the rear-view and cackled ""*You know they [landlords] are going to evict you, right? Your problems haven't even started, and I'd be more than happy to make them worse!*""

I should have kept my mouth shut. It's not that simple though. It's not that I said anything I shouldn't have, it's just that I said anything at all; pretty much the cardinal rule of law enforcement interaction. I did quote Buzz Lightyear, calling him a ""sad, strange little man"". I was in a heightened state that I'd never been in before, and I wanted to know why he did what he'd just done to me, fearful of what he might do next.  I'd ask him what I did wrong, he'd shake his head and chuckle, ""*You're just too stupid for words*"" Huh? I'm stupid, so you tased me? ""*I just got off work, you. ran. at. me. with. a. taser. and now I'm trying to understand why?*""


I'm getting too caught up in details. My apologies, they matter to me, not you! The entire scene was so irrational that trying to articulate it now is a fools errand anyways. So we kept up going back and forth, until he finally tells me ""*You weren't wearing your seatbelt.*""

WAT

This is when I knew he was full of shit. Until that point, I thought there might be some outside chance that something legitimate was going on. *But now I knew the fix was in.* I have a (bad?) habit of taking my seatbelt off as I cut my wheel 90^^^o into a parking space. I've always done it, mainly because my Dad does it, I guess, but this time was no exception. Less than a car length from parking a car, I instinctively take off my seatbelt. *So, run at me with a taser?*

Once we get to jail, I'm booked, processed and 8 hours later, my wife is able to complete the run-around required to bail someone out (another story!) She tells me about the cops showing up right after we left, how several people saw it, etc. One neighbor, I'll call Barbie, is also a teacher. Barbie was pulling in the back entrance to the neighborhood, which is naturally on the opposite side as the front. Guess who was sitting at the back entrance? GI Joe. When she pulled in, he pulled up behind her, following her through the neighborhood, about .2 of a mile. At the same time, I'm coming from the opposite direction, and she sees me park my car about 200 feet in front of her. Barbie was about to park, but she's forced to hit her brakes as GI Joe whips around her, and speeding past my parking spot, he pulls a 180 and jumps out of his car, running my direction, taser drawn. She sat in her car for a few minutes thinking something bad was happening, and by the time she approached, I was already in cuffs.


Fast forward to his arrest report, where he details that he watched me recklessly pull into the front of the neighborhood at a high rate of speed without a seatbelt. Traveling at a high rate of speed in this parking lot *would be* reckless, **AND... given the immediate roundabout and 4 speedbumps impeding the 100 yards between the main road and where I parked, impressive if not impossible!**

Physics aside, he was at the back entrance... not the front, as he detailed. The remainder of his report contains the ""standard"" jargon, vaguely describing me as ""aggressive"" and ""uncooperative"", and that I ""threateningly lunged at him"". Per my lawyers, it reads like the culmination of a knowledge obtained through spending a week at a police seminar, and ""he clearly wrote what he needed to write to cover his ass"". 

I was charged with 7 misdemeanors. They've all been dropped.

This guy has had a lot of complaints in the past, many, if not most, with reports that read identical to mine. Evidently, GI Joe wants to be a cop, but can't. I've been methodically accumulating information about him, and juicy tidbits, such as he was once arrested for impersonating an officer in another state. That's not the big kahuna though. I don't want to get detailed, but I'll say this. To start a ""Company Police"" force in my state, you need to have a $1,000,000 insurance retainer, and I think I know how he got it. It involves some shady shit between him and some ""investors"" from out of state, all of whom work for the same real estate firm. This is my consolation. I'd have a hard time proving ""damages"" in civil court since I never went to a psychiatrist or anything. 

Anywho, I've left out a ton of good stuff, some of it probably important to understand the scope of this, but I'm going to wrap this up regardless. I'm sick of typing this right now; it bums me out and I'm hungry. I'll answer questions if it'll help, (especially if you're a lawyer!) but this will have to do for now.

This was all happening during the Chicago World Fair, which is how he got away with it. Lots and lots of random people going out, and his place was supposedly a hotel. He was pretty greedy, so he sold the bones of his victims and nobody really questioned it. When it was over, he moved on.

He got caught, eventually, because he tried to arrange an insurance scam/murder. He had a ""friend"" of his, told that friend that they were going to run an insurance scam to get life insurance money, and then he just killed the friend. And took the money. He bragged about this to a cellmate while in jail for an unrelated crime, and had promised to give that cellmate some money, but he didn't, and the cellmate ratted him out. When they caught up to him, he was trying to build a second castle in Texas.

"As someone who has worked in both organic and traditional farming, I see the benefit of GMO's, I also see that they are not inherently free of potential abuse, like any modern technology.  Its how it is used.  If we are using GMO's to create a sustainable farming system while maximizing output, great!  If someone cares how their food was grown and decides they prefer paying extra organic, great!  But if someone (consumer or producer) argues that because GMO's are intrinsically good and therefore we don't need to account for the fact that agriculture is based on living biological systems that require a level of sustainability to remain effective, then I have to disagree.  It is a useful and effective technology, but its easy to see how a corporation driven solely by profit can abuse it.  It is neither good nor evil, that falls on the USER.

"Managing rental property I've had some pretty shitty experiences. I will sum up what I think is by far the most foul. So foul it almost belongs in a lovecraft story.

So. We have a small apartment. Technically an efficiency. It had a single room for livjng/bedroom and a small kitchen with a bathroom attached. However there were two nice closests. One a walk in.
So an overweight fellow moves in. No issues. He's got a simple job, his mom helps pay the rent from time to time so it never bothered us when he started changing jobs like socks. Soon he wasn't paying his rent at all and his mother would send checks whenever we bothered to call. So finally we decided to give him notice and evict him. No biggie. Happens alot. People don't pay.

So I go in the clean the place up. He up and left pretty quickly and left a rather gross oily wrinkled note that said something about he didn't want the furniture left in the apartment. Ok dick, thanks for leaving the sofa or something right?

Wrong. What happened next was absolutely disgusting. First, I walked in the back door only to be greeted by the smell of filth and mold. I threw up. Yep. Literally threw up within seconds. Flash forward like 20 minutes and I'm back with a respirator. Like a cliche lovecraftian protagonist I enter the tomb/apartment equiped with respirator, waders, and long rubber gloves. The refrigerator was open, green and white mold growing over cheese and an old milk carton. There were yellow stains as well as if some mold monster decided to take a piss while it molded up the place. Next I noticed the entire top of the stove was covered in oil/blood?/dirt/ramennoodles? And who knows what else. Moving on, the small counter had like five pizza boxes piled up. Ok cool. Nope. Mold. Half still had pizza. Mold mold mold. Oh what's that? Six more fell in the crack behind the end of the counter and the wall. WAAAAY more mold.

So fuck the kitchen. Moving on. The other room did indeed have a sofa (ok?) and on it was more pizza boxes. More mold. I found a pile of underwear and socks on the corner. Smelled like ghastly ghoulish foul shit-stuffs. Fantastic. Opened the walk in closest. Another pile of pizza boxes. Really? Ten more?!? Who eats this much and leaves the fuckin boxes around. Is that pizza rockin around in there? Yep. With mold. Huzzah!
Leaving that mess I go back to the couch and grab the box on top. Only as I grabbed the despicable mess I found it was melded into the pillow, as if some abomination was clinging to its home. Oh what's that? Shit under the pillows? Shoulda guessed. Wait... Condoms... Socks? More pizza and pizza boxes....
(blackout for undetermined amount of time)

Come to and decide to check the last two rooms before I decide to nuke the place from orbit. The closet/pantry in the bathroom hall was a shallow but tall closet and upon opening I was set upon by some fell beast. Summoned from the deepest pits of fiery ovens and grease it was a tower of pizza boxes. Yep.over six feet tall. Enough to tower over me and collapse onto me. Spilling crusts and mold and powered blue-green-white mold shit everywhere. Resisting the urge to pass out I add these to the rest in a demonic pizza box effigy in the center of the kitchen as I plan my next move.

The bathroom.

Steeling myself for the worst. It wasn't until I opened the door that I realized it could get worse. Yep that's right. Just like you other landlords. The toilet was clogged. Full of shit. Probably didn't want us coming over to fix it and discover the secret shrine he had created to the pizza gods. And of course what do you do? The toilets full. But the sink tub have drains too. Great. Yup. Shit in it all..

And that was how I spent three weeks deep cleaning and rebuilding a hellish apartment rented out to a pizza-god worshipping zealot who must've performed inhuman rites concerning socks, condoms, pizza, mold, and fetid shit chunks.

I hope you all enjoyed this public message.
TLDR: I founds a rats nest of mold, 87 pizza boxes, 12 old pizzas, 4 used condoms mixed with socks and more pizza boxes. And a bathroom where every drain was clogged with shit.

"When I was an EMT in MT I had a very similar experience with a young man who was crushed be a falling tree... Such a gut-wrenching day. The young man was due to marry the daughter of the sawyer who felled the tree a couple weeks after the incident. To make matters worse, everyone in the ED that day knew the internal bleeding could have been stopped and the young man saved if the surgeon wasn't a pompous prick who refused to come in that day (very small town). The look on everyone's faces when he reached out and held onto me 1.5 hours into treatment (I was bagging the patient), was utter relief, monitor's were checked and he was still flat-lined... I hate that surgeon to this day for deciding that kids fate as we all squeezed bags of fluid and blood into him and exhausted ourselves believing he would make it. His life was worth more than what that Dr decided over the phone. I miss helping people, but I never miss being helpless and losing these battles.

EDIT: the Surgeon was on-call first day of a three day rotation that was relieved by traveling physicians that the hospital paid for. He did not come in and see the patient stating he was indisposed. The surgeon lost his license for other negligence. I'm sorry that some people here are mad that I have my own emotional battles with cases like this, how dare you judge me for this being a difficult case that I worked? Was it the most difficult? No. Was it creepy that he grabbed me? Yeah.  

And to those that are asking about the hospital and town? Rural Montana is super rural folks, and the weather and terrain in the Rockies can certainly decide whether a helicopter or other treatment facility are options for us! We had a surgeon in our town because he CHOSE to open the practice there, he had hopital privileges in exchange for his 3 day rotations, he opened his practice 2 days a week for office consults and set those 3 days aside to operate on his cases and be on call. Judge what you will.

"I don't think me being Muslim would change my views on the refugees just because they are Muslim. 


I've worked with refugees before in America and in Chile. They are truly some of the most broken human beings I've met. They are trying to rebuild in a country they know little to nothing about and where the people barely want them there. However, they work so diligently to learn the language and culture in order to get a job that can help support their families. They don't ask for much. They just want a little safe home where they can raise their children. Many don't want free handouts. Many want to earn their way in life. When I was in Chile, I worked with a group of Palestinians who spoken their native language with their families and pretty good Spanish with the locals. They morphed traditional foods with common Chilean dishes. Both parents worked day and night to provide for their children. They, like pretty much everyone in the world, just want the chance to live a peaceful life. When I see the news, I feel so helpless. 

After working with refugees, I realized how privileged of a life I've led. Meeting so many of them and getting to know them really changed how I view life. ",244

"&gt;Two women, Sandra Smith and Nicole Childress, discovered the victim, 14-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone, after he had managed to escape from Dahmer's apartment, naked, bleeding from the rectum and heavily under the influence of drugs. They called 911, Balcerzak and his partner Joseph Gabrish were dispatched. Though theLaotian immigrant had been in the country for ten years and spoke &gt;English fluently,[1] in his drugged and brain-injured state, Konerak was unable to communicate his situation to authorities. Dahmer found the boy with the police and convinced them that the boy was his 19-year-old lover. Smith and Childress recognized the boy from the neighborhood and were convinced that Sinthasomphone's life was in peril. They communicated this to the officers and tried to save the boy. However, Balcerzak and his partner returned Konerak to Dahmer's apartment, against Konerak's and the women's protests. The officers noticed a strange smell in Dahmer's apartment, which was the decaying corpse of a previous victim in the bedroom, but made no attempt to investigate. Later that evening Dahmer sexually abused, killed, and dismembered the boy.

&gt; Balcerzak's and Gabrish's positions and roles within the Milwaukee Police &gt;Department were terminated[2] after their actions were widely publicized, including an audiotape of the officers making homophobic statements to their dispatcher and cracking jokes about having reunited the ""lovers"". The officers had never checked the boy's ID or verified his identity. The officers did not check Dahmer's identification; had they done so, they would have discovered that Dahmer was a sex offender previously convicted for molestingSinthasomphone's older brother.

"On a medical school rotation in psychiatry...

I rotated at a hospital which is essentially a full time psych ward for folks who have pleaded insanity or ended up in an acute psych hospital and were eventually transferred here because they could not become well enough to get home. The place was actually very nice. It was nothing like you see on TV. It was essentially like a college dorm with 6 or 8 wings total. each wing had like 16 rooms and each wing was broken down by gender. Each wing also had a gated outdoor area and a gym area so the patients had a relatively good life considering. 

Met many patients with many crazy stories but one always will stand out. 

This young guy, about 25 years old was there. He had had these delusions just after college about some girl he had a crush on from his freshman year of college. She wrote for a popular magazine and he supposedly had these delusions that she was writing about him to make fun of him. He hunted her down in her home town, raped her, and tried to kill her but she escaped. He then plead insanity and was placed here. 

I went up and talked to him as a little 3rd year med student. I started asking about his delusions and what not. It turns out his father was high up in a international corporation and worth millions. The kid, who was hauntingly normal on the surface and incredibly creepy once you started digging, told me that he basically plead insanity only because his lawyers said to. He never had delusions. Never had hallucinations. Nothing. He basically thought the girl was hot in college, drove 400 miles to rape her, then freaked out. But his lawyers advised he plead insanity because as a soft upper class kid he'd do much better in the psych hospital than in prison. 

So there he was. Luckily, he'll likely spend longer in there than he would have in prison because generally that's how it works. But he seriously creeped me the fuck out. ",701

&gt;10 days after the Chernobyl disaster, an even greater disaster awaited, potentially hundreds of times worse than the initial Chernobyl explosion - The basement below the melting reactor core was flooded with thousands of gallons of water, and if the tonnes of molten reactor core broke through the cement floor and hit that pool of water, it would have created a thermal explosion so large, and sending radioactive material so far, that 3 square kilometers would be flattened, millions would have been killed, and half of Europe would have been rendered uninhabitable.
Alexie Ananenko, Valeri Bezpalov, and Boris Baranov volunteered to dive into the extremely radioactive water, knowing full well that it was far, far more radioactivity than what was known to be the lethal limit. They were able to find the manual release valve, and drain the basement of water. They died of radiation poisoning 2 weeks later. The corium did eventually melt through the concrete and reach the basement, as feared, but now dry. These 3 men saved millions of lives, and half a continent from being exposed to radiation.

I would then level out with whatever booze I hadn't consumed in the previous day or night's bender (I didn't have much sense of time then).

Carly Fiorina is the wealthy divorcee you did some housework for a couple times and who turned the divorce settlement into a successful business career but is terribly lonely and constantly drinks wine to numb the pain and if you're not careful she'll corner you and drunkenly rant about something insane.


Martin O'Malley is the dude who really wants to be your friend for some reason and it's fun to chill with him once in a while but being around him too much gets kind of awkward and in them back of your mind you start wondering if maybe he wants to have sex with you.


John Kasich is your father in law or uncle by marriage or something who you don't really get along with but you tolerate him because he knows how to unclog a pipe and fix a loose wire and that kind of stuff.

"I remember talking to a State Trooper once, he was assigned with a Field Training Officer and was responding to a concerned neighbor's call of a drunk neighbor. 

The troopers respond and are greeted at the residence by a heavily inebriated male individual, completely nude besides a small tutu dress around his waist. The individual had an erection, with blood all over, but no visible signs of a cut. 

Upon further inspection, the troopers found, stuffed under the kitchen table, a unconscious 3 year old, bleeding from the anus, because her father had just finished raping her in his drunken state.  

I'll never forgot the trooper's description of having to restraining his field training officer from blowing that guy's brains out. The FTO unholstered his firearm and put it right to the guy's head prompting the trainee to tackle him.

"So, aside from typical smile inducing things like interrupting teacher, standing up saying how immature he behaved and apologizing before doing it again a moment later, one thing really stands out. I don't know if it was the Pirates of Caribbean reruns that caused it or if the guy was Jack Sparrow deep down but here goes. So on our PE in pool, we had that rule, that anyone whos not swimming today has to sit on a bench with no socks due to hygienic reasons. Well, Mr Pirate doesn't seem so fond of that idea so he just goes in with his boots and shit. After participating piece of class got ready for swimming, we all proceed to pool hall. Immedietely he gets asked by our quite awkward, young teacher to take off his socks, to which he, as you guessed declines. He was a well estabilished school clown, mind you, so as soon as answered the teacher goes to get him from one side and the lifeguard came from other. At this moment he proceeds to take out his phone, key and also takes off his boots and hands it to nearest person saying ""take care of it"". He then jumps fully clothed into pool, swims like a madman to the other side while both caretakers watch in awe to the sides. He gets out of the pool, and shoeless and wet sprints out of school.

"Buried alive for 10+hrs following a 7.5 earthquake

Edit for Background-- in 1999, I was visiting cousins in Yalova, a fishing town in Turkey. I'm a former Air Force Brat, so we had just traveled north from our home in Adana, near Incirlik Airforce Base. I was asleep when it happened and the rubble that buried me presumably knocked me out. I woke up with that chalky taste only cement dust can give in total darkness and everyone screaming for help. My neighbor's screams especially fucked with me.. she was begging anyone ( in Turkish ) to help free her son ( 13yr/old ) from the rubble. I didn't see what became of him until much later, but his body caved in from the weight from the waist down. I never cared to learn if he was still breathing when she was crying for help.

I have multiple torso-length scars on my back from that, along with scars on my feet from all the broken glass I stepped on in the darkness when I was able to get free.

okay, that escaping doesn't seem to work. Just do four spaces and ignore the slashes.

&gt; ~~strikethrough~~

\~~strikethrough~~

&gt; super^script

super\^script

You can also scale the superscript into seemingly infinity, by adding additional \^:

&gt; super^script^is^cool

super\^script\^is\^cool

***
(credits to /u/KlonopinUpGirl)  
Additionally, you can use parantheses to group text, like this: (a b c).  
Normally when you use superscript and use a space in the text, it ends up ^like this. (\^like this)  
But by grouping the text with parantheses, you can use superscript on the whole text. Alternatively, you can also put single letters into parantheses to use superscript only on those letters, not the whole word.  
Example: ^(Yorokobe Shounen) or th^(i)s  
Example: \^(Yorokobe Shounen) or th\^(i)s 

***
&gt; If you put a # before your words at the start of the line, it looks
&gt; #like this

This one was explained well, but I can do it better:
\#like this

&gt; You sometimes have to put an extra return between lines, use the live preview box below to confirm.

Two spaces = new line[space][space]  
Two enter = new paragraph[enter][enter]

example

&gt; Sometimes characters don't show up, this guy:

is not escaped properly.

&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

-
&gt; should look like this:  
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯  
Now this is simply too much. If you want to write special characters (\*, \\, \^ etc) normally, you need to escape them with a backslash (\\) in front of them. If you want to write \\, you have to write \\\\. But the third backslash in the smiley is useless.

&gt; you may have to use more than one (like with ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ), but not often.

I don't think I remember anytime when you would have to escape a character twice, except maybe if you were dealing with two different formatting systems at the same time.

-
Additionally:

If a new paragraph isn't enough padding for you, you can add \- on a new line and it'll add another bit of space. Like this:

&gt; a[enter][enter]
&gt;
&gt;\-  
&gt;b[enter][enter]
&gt;
&gt;c

becomes this:

&gt;a
&gt;
&gt;-
&gt;b
&gt;
&gt;c

You can also place a space between quotes like this.  

Without:

&gt; a

&gt; b

With:

&gt; a

-
&gt; b

Also, as you saw in the first example of -, you should generally use [enter][enter] before formatting like quotes, code or such, as they won't work otherwise. Basically, every formatting change which affects whole lines needs to follow two enter.

-
Also, *** will create a horizontal line:

***

"Another one related to horse racing that's a not very well-known piece of history:

Everyone is familiar with the aspect of an announcer calling a horserace, but not a lot of people know where it started.

On February 5, 1927 in Tijuana, Mexico there was a film being shot at the racetrack. A track official noticed the way a director was using a microphone and a loudspeaker to direct his crew and actors during the filming. The idea came to him that if he had a microphone set up in the Stewards booth that led to a set of speakers, he could call the positions of the horses like a director gave direction. 

Later that day, he had it set up without telling any of the patrons to the track about it. When people first experienced it, they were extremely confused. Before that people would keep track of the horses themselves with binoculars and often were unable to get a great view at certain angles. After they got used to it, they loved hearing a race being called and it became an everyday thing at that small track. Now, it's an extremely important part of modern day racing all across the world.  ",2098

"Pixar's quality comes from them not pandering to children and releasing movies that are meant to watched by families but has darker themes. In fact, that's what Disney does too, think about how fucked up The Lion King and Hunchback of Notre Dame are. The Incredibles is thematically dark but doesn't do gore or anything like that. Characters are more complex and interesting.

Cars was just a kids movie. It wasn't bad, the animation was really good, the voice acting was good, it had a lot of humor, but my god was it uninteresting. The antagonist is just kind of a douche. The protagonist is also kind of a douche. The goal of the movie is simple to the point of not being much to care about. He just has to get to a race and win it. Oh look, he won it. The conflict and its resolution are obvious from the get go. In other Pixar movies, the ""apparent"" conflict changes throughout, with an overall ""problem"" that is really what is solved in the end. In UP, the apparent conflict is that the dude wants to go to the falls. Then it becomes him struggling with this kid and bird. Then it's escaping a crazed icon. But overall the real conflict is that he wants a peaceful way to end his life after the death of his wife, which he achieves and the whole movie you're not exactly sure how. The inner personality conflict isn't in your face. The goal of Finding Nemo is to find Nemo (duh), but it's also Marlin's journey to regain courage and accept that his son cannot be constantly protected from harm. All in all, this ends with Cars having not much catharsis at the end. Monsters Inc *feels* great when you see the monsters adopting laugh power and Sully gets to see Boo in the end. Ratatouille fills you with something beyond just satisfaction when Ego writes his review and Remy and Linguine open their own restaurant. Cars just ended. The conflict had a resolution we knew from the start and that's the resolution that happened and alright great, he won the race, nice way to spend an hour and a half.

That's my take on it anyways, I'm sure others feel differently.",128

"I'm doing great, actually. I'll put the abridged version of my story here.

My parents became foster parents and took in 4 girls (2 older, 2 younger) when I was like 10. So, my sister and I all of a sudden had a much larger family.

Fast forward 6 years. I've been treating these girls as family this whole time. When people asked about them, I just called them my sisters. My dad had taught me that it was my job to protect them and look out for them whenever I could, and I did just that.

I got in a lot of fights for them. Way too many. My younger sisters were definitely handfuls, but I loved then anyways. One day, I get home from my friend's house, and they're gone. Just... Gone.

Turns out my mother told the state that she couldn't handle them anymore, that they were just bad kids, rebellious, etc. So, they relocated them. My mother was so happy to have them gone, and I just stood there, shocked, hurt, and confused.

I had it out with my mother, yelled at her until my voice gave out. Told her that she was just the lowest of the low, and that I absolutely detested her.

My dad got home from work and heard the shouting. He didn't know what happened, so I told him. He didn't do much of anything, but there's not a lot be could have done anyways.

My mother told me that if I didn't like her decision, I could leave too. She obviously didn't think I would. I went to my room, packed as many clothes as I could. I walked by her, told her I was leaving and that I'd never talk to her again. I told her that she can't just tear my family apart and not expect consequences.

I loved my sisters, and I still did what I could to make sure they were okay. 

I don't regret what I did one bit. 

After I left, I was homeless for about a year. Then got a job, got a place of my own, and everything started to be okay. Eventually I ended up working as a bounty hunter.

This happened 11 years ago. Today, I'm super close with all of my sisters (even too close with one of them... Things got weird), own my home, a couple vehicles, and am generally just happy.",300

For what it's worth, the next month with 5 Friday/Saturday/Sundays in is actually July this year. Then it's December 2017. Then after that it's not until March 2019. A lot of people fall down on this because they're not that regular, due both to leap years and the lengths of months.

Apparently the bride and groom had been sitting for a couple of hours thinking of everything that they, in hindsight, thought had not been 100% perfect... and then written this as a complaint to all guests.

Since all the complaints were really small things, and lots of them didn't even happen, but were mere rumors... this lead to a lot of angry guests calling each other on the phone, more angry letters as replies, etc.

From what little bit I remember. Apparently during a party I was having I thought it would be a great idea to start a porn company called BrownHole productions! I went into great detail completely talking out of my ass about what we would do and who my stars would be. As we continued drinking my cousins girlfriend kept saying she wanted to be a star in one of our films and that she wanted to be in one with me because I have a pierced MicroDong. My cousin being completely trashed agreed so he filmed my going to town on his girlfriend in my garage on my pool table. Then after that from what I've seen and was told I talked to of my coworkers into giving me a tandem Beejer on camera. At that point I was completely black out drunk. I got woke up to my cousin flipping out because we left the camcorder hooked up to the tv and it was looping me railing his girlfriend. Then we found all my logo drawings that were like a kindergarten drawing and a business plan. After we all sobered up I thought yeah I'm not disappointed by this and for the coming months we decided we would roll with this in order to try to get as many girls to sleep with us as possible. It worked a few more times but then we gave up on it unfortunately,712

"I work in UChicago IT fixing computers, so I've met many people that have worked both with him and had him as a professor. I know that yes, I did not have him personally, but seeing as this thread hasn't gone anywhere I may as well chip in.

From what I've heard he was an excellent professor, very well versed on constitutional law, and (like all professors at Chicago), extremely demanding. The amount of writing people do at the law school can be insane, and Constitutional Law is considered the most prestigious class. Getting appointed a professor at a law school is both really hard and really political, so you have to do good work. I had one person that I was helping that complained that he seemed a little preoccupied with his politics at times, occasionally not responding to students that frequently, but he still said he was a good professor. 

Anyway, at some point IT was supposed to deactivate his ID from the computer system for being inactive for too long, but there was a big to-do because people thought that would be seen as a snub to the guy who is the president. So he is still active, and he (technically) still has an email address that students can contact him at (no, he doesn't answers it). Conceivably he could walk in tomorrow and ask us to help him fix his computer, though I think that he has other people to help do that.

Casual sex can cause unwanted pregnancy, spread infectious disease, or start an unhealthy relationship.  Many people think they are responsible about birth control, or safe sex, or that they can distance their emotions when having casual sexual encounters, but these things just aren't true 100% of the time.  The problem with casual sex, especially in your example of meeting at a bar when there's alcohol involved, is the unanticipated repercussions.

Comparing it to getting a Big Mac is perfect.  Everyone knows getting a Big Mac to ""scratch an itch"" is a bad habit.  It's not very nutritious, and the kind of people who regularly give into that itch often have serious health problems.

Now, to be clear, these are just basic biological urges.  I'm not completely advocating that we should shame people when they give into natural urges.  Shame is a problem in and of itself.  If we consider risky behaviors as criteria with which to judge people, it creates psychological and social issues that are just as unproductive.

But just as it's important to acknowledge getting a Big Mac to ""scratch an itch"" rather than choosing healthier nutritional options is unwise, and may lead to problems if done often, it's important to acknowledge the same is true of casual sex.

Society is built on a social contract that requires us to fight certain biological urges, such as the urge to kill, or the urge to steal, or the urge to get drunk and drive fast on the highway.  Society has a vested interest in restricting risky and destructive behaviors, even if they are only between two people, because those two people affect the rest of society in ways they don't realize.  And the most common way society enforces these concerns, other than laws and government intervention, is good old-fashioned peer pressure and shame.",144

"Yes. It was an issue, when I was a kid, whether or not your parents would let you watch the Simpsons. It was seen as crass and abrasive. Bart Simpson, in particular, was seen as having a negative influence on children.

The Simpsons, up until about season 8, was a beautiful contribution, both to animated storytelling, and TV in general. I was a fanatical viewer. The tone was the last optimistic note American humor had on a large scale. The Simpsons mocked the world, but they did it in a way where you can't mistake their inherent humanity. They cared enough about society to lampoon its ills, its idiosyncrasies, its absurdities. It's like they wanted to save us all from being broken, cynical bastards.

The tone of satire, which is largely just sarcasm now, has evolved to being one of the yukking wiseass, standing in the ashes of the world. *Hehehehehe. This thing sucks.* No hope, no encouragement. And the only thing humor cares about is tearing establishments down. Humorists are like box elder bugs. They need the tree, they kill the tree; they need to kill the tree.

It's not that The Simpsons is holy or sacred, its relevance here is purely symbolic, but absolutely representative of the time. Bart saying 'damn' was controversial, because our humor wasn't wrapped up in a *Oh no they di'int* arms race. There were still sunsets to watch with your wife, or to ride off into. Now, it's a punchline and cut to black. All the better if someone suffers for the laughter.

This isn't a criticism in the 'Back in my day' vein. This is just an observation on the tone and worldview our humor, and by extension, we, espouse. ",108
"I was the best man at my good friends wedding to a rather psychotic woman that he just could not understand was insane. It was in an old house and they got married on the landing of the staircase. He came out and while we were waiting for her to come out, the groom and I both heard her in the room upstairs telling her dad that she didn't want to do it and finally he told her something pretty close to ""there are 100 people out there that came to see you get married so you're going to #$&amp;%ing do this"". Well, she did it. I have no idea why my friend didn't bail, or get it annulled the next day. He blocked that memory out somehow. Fast forward 7 years and he has now spent &gt; $100k on a custody suit, but now has sole custody of their child after she repeatedly proved her level of insanity to a judge.  Things got really insane due to many false allegations on her part and the propensity of the system to favor the mother, but persistence (and willingness to give up all of your possessions and take on debt to maintain a relationship with your child) won out in this case. Funny part of the story was when they got divorced, he asked me why I didn't warn him before he got married. I reminded him of all the times I tried to and he finally ""remembered"" them. ",287

"I interned at the office of the chief medical examiner when I was eighteen. Saw a lot of interesting stuff, learned a lot of interesting things. One case stuck with me more than the rest.

I arrived one morning, went down to the basement where bodies were laid out for rounds every morning. On tables lay the usual, a couple folks who died in a hospital and needed a partial autopsy to sign off on a death certificate, a drug overdose, a drug murder. 

Then, on one table, there was a blue Tupperware bin. A big one. About 3'x3'x2'. It was filled with concrete, and out of the edges a little plastic wrap was lining between the concrete and the bin, and then out of the top of the concrete a couple toes were poking out.

The story was out in the county a family saw a small fire in the woods outside of their house, called the fire department, and after putting out the flames, they found this bin. 

When we cracked the bin open we found half of a man, about from the belly button down. Someone had thought the best way to dispose of this body would be to cut it in half, wrap it in plastic, put it in a Tupperware bin, fill the bin with concrete, and set it on fire. 

What they had really done was essentially cook the body in an oven, with the plastic wrap acting as a roasting bag. Skin was sloughing off of the legs and feet, and the skin was dis colored by this time, a nice green. 

Though this was about ten years ago I distinctly remember still being able to make our saw marks on the top edge of this half however. 

Notes were taken, and no signs of death were found on the legs, and no indications of the persons identity either. 

Unfortunately my internship ended a few weeks before they found the top half, so I never got to learn more about the case, but the image still certainly sticks with me til now ",282

"I'm a police man. A bunch of us met up to clear a pretty big old factory close to our downtown while looking for two or three people.

We couldn't find anything in the first building at all but there were clothes and sleeping bags everywhere.

You can cross over to the second building from one of the top floors of the first building, so we did that. Still nothing, but the staircase leading to the other floors of the second building wasn't as fucked from the top, so we started clearing from the top down on the second building. Still couldn't find anyone, but there was a growing sense of inevitability at that point.

I think we got to the second floor of the second building and it was the only one with any kind of attempt at a lock. Basically the outer door knob was wrapped in some yellow cord and funneled through where the lock would be into the room. Naturally we cut that shit and went inside.

The room was totally dark but we shined our flashlights on a few people sleeping in bags or shitty mattresses. Then we find some more homeless folks. Then more. And more and more. There were homeless people everywhere. Most of the homeless in our city are fairly harmless and keep to themselves, but it was unsettling finding an unofficial shelter for that many people.

My first semester of college I had an art class. There was always this one weird kid that sat in the back and talked to himself in a low mumble.

The weird kid took off his shoe and fucking threw it at her. It nailed her in the face and the sheer look of shock on her face made me laugh so god damn hard. Solid class would take it again.,268

"I grew up in a very rural area before the internet era. I spent countless hours trying to stalk animals just out of sheer boredom after I read a book called The Tracker. I never hunted, but I got to the point where I was sometimes able to sneak within touching distance of the occasional rabbit or deer. 

It turned into a game. I started noticing how much noise people make when they walk and I just started making sure I moved silently, even when running. It became just a habit I didn't think about much except for randomly getting a little annoyed at someone dragging their feet or change jingling in their pockets. 

I'm a good long distance runner, and I constantly forget to cough or something before I pass people on trails. I've had people nearly fall down when a large man appears at their elbow out of nowhere. I run with my wife and she *hates* this, she hates it even more when we get separated in a store and I appear out of nowhere beside her but the stubborn part of me kind of feels like other people should just pay better attention. 

edit: It was just brought to my attention that I have another creepy trait from my childhood. I was dirt poor, and our house didn't always have electricity. So I kind of just made a game out of that too. I got really good at navigating in pitch blackness. But I did it so long that it became a habit. I tend to just not bother turning lights on in the house. So I'll be minding my own business, relaxing on the couch, listening to a podcast, the light will go on and I'll see my wife nearly swallow her tongue because to her I was just ostensibly sitting silently in a dark room doing nothing at all. She doesn't like that. Or the fact that I follow her around the house turning off lights. I'm starting to realize that I'm a lot creepier than I thought I was.

"I worked at a travel agency as an in-house web designer. I also did general office tasks.

One day my boss (who boasts about traveling 120 days a year) decided to go on vacation in Europe, along with most of the office, leaving me to hold down the fort. I was fine with it, since there was likely very little work to be done and I was going to make a lot of extra money.

When he got back, a customer complained that their cruise they had booked online was cancelled. I was blamed for it because, apparently, I was supposed to process their payment in our system. Bear in mind, this was not my client, I had no knowledge of any responsibilities toward this client, and it was not part of my normal duties to process any payments.

So at the end of the day my boss took me to the back room (a cramped, uncomfortable space) to talk to me about how I had fucked up. I denied everything, because this was my boss' way of placing the blame on someone else for his own mistakes. He told me to take two days off to ""think about how I can grow with the company"", and finished by tapping my shoulder and saying ""Grow up /u/Mirgo "" and giving me a douchey looking smile. To top it off, he had also reduced my hourly rate by $1.00 per hour, after I had worked there with distinction for almost a year.

I was absolutely livid. As soon as I left for the day, I went home, chilled out, and starting planning my next move.

The next day I applied for a couple of jobs, and got an interview on the second day at another company. I was offered the position, and started a couple weeks later.

When I went back to the travel agency, I sat down and waited for my boss, who always had a habit of coming in late. Once he did, I said, quite loudly, ""&lt;boss' name&gt;, I came here to let you know that I quit. I don't want to continue to work for you for less money. I also expect to find my final check in my mailbox by next Monday at my regular pay rate."". He only replied with ""Do you have a timesheet"", to which I said ""It's your responsibility to keep track of my hours, so you'd better have them"". He then said ""Ok, have a nice day."" and that was the end of it.

I ended up taking him to court later over unpaid wages, and won. Not the best way to earn a severance, but it works.",5137

One Friday night before our reporting deadline (means we are exhausted AF) Beth made this elaborate plan that includes everyone going out after work from 5 pm to different places that she likes to drink, a Japanese sake bar, a sports club, karaoke and then casino until we finally top it off at a night club full of drunk 18 year olds . It's all well and good except my workplace is full of people in their late 20s early 30s who just aren't into that type of hectic and expensive drinking. 

In the end of the night people start leaving and numbers dwindled after each location until it's only Beth and another girl left who is super over it and says she's had enough and ain't gonna line up outside some kids club for 30 minutes at 1 am just to be drinking with random 18 year olds. 

Beth, who is pissed drunk at this stage started crying and cussing about all the effort she went into organizing a night out so everyone can have fun and how we are all ungrateful shits and all sorts of bitch fit.

"I've posted this before but here we go;

Every once in a while I'll go ""urban exploring"" with one of my friends. Usually he just checks out abandoned houses and the odd factory or two, it can be a really cool experience for anyone who is into history or photography or asbestos inhalation. Today though, he decided we're going to a local abandoned hospital , at night, with just the two of us, because it'll be more ""intense"" that way and he's evidently never seen a single horror movie in his life.
Despite my mild hesitations we end up getting to this place as it's starting to get dark. We make our way in through a window that someone has torn the boarding off of and my friend gives his usual yell throughout the building announcing his presence so we don't startle anyone else who might be inside by saying ""WE'RE NOT THE COPS. WE'RE JUST LOOKING AROUND AND TAKING SOME PICTURES"" By his logic we're doing a courtesy to anyone else exploring the building who might panic if they heard us coming otherwise, by my logic we're announcing our presence to every homeless person in the building who might want to steal a camera from two dumb kids.

Despite my fears, nothing bad happens. We make it through the building going through multiple floors and checking out the roof last. We get a ton of cool pictures and take a look at some of the creepy ass old bathtubs and tables they left in the place. There's some really cool graffiti inside as well mixed in with your usual shitty tags. The whole building is pitch black except for the few spots where moon light shines through so we literally can only see whatever we happen to be pointing our phones at at the time or by using the flash on the camera. Even though I'm still worried about being murdered, I'm glad I went and I'm less freaked out as we're making our way back to the window we came in. We get back to the room and I hop out the window first and have my buddy pass me the camera. As I take it from him and he starts climbing out the window a soft voice from what sounds like just 10 ft or so inside the building says *""Wait...""*. I look around my friend and can just barely see a silhouette standing in the doorway from where we entered the room.

Now, I'm not proud of what happened next but in that moment the force with which my butt hole puckered propelled me away from that building with enough forward momentum to last until I was at the edge of the property back towards the road. My friend followed after me quickly, more so to laugh at me than out of fear. He didn't seem to be too worried about it though he agreed we definitely weren't going back. I know this isn't the most exciting story, but what terrified me at the time was that I was 100% sure we were alone in that building. It was dead silent aside from us. The fact that the Man (?) waited until right as we were leaving horrified me as it made me realize they could have been watching and following us throughout that entire building. Just listening to us talk, watching us taking pictures...just following us.

Needless to say I don't do too much urban exploring anymore, at least not at night in old spooky buildings constructed prior to WW1.

With that rule in place, every single one of my students are college bound. They're all enrolled in AP or honors classes. That means they're the kids that have it easy when it comes to school. They don't study. They don't fucking know how. 

I didn't realize this in school, but Spanish is hard. You need to practice. If they don't get homework, they won't know how to practice. They'll only get in class practice and the information will never stick. So, they get some homework. 

I understand they have things after school. I do too. I have to plan and design the lessons with each student in mind, I have to create the work and the homework, I have to grade it all, and I do all of this with a life completely unrelated to school.

Also, for guys commenting so much in general (not in this thread) that girls need to be honest and clear and not drop hints when asking them to do something, that needs to be employed here too.

Star Wars played for several months and then would be re-released a few times over the next three years before Empire came out.  And often, they would sell out.

Hubby wasn't having any of that. Domed her with the pickaxe. Also, saw a guy with third degree burns over about 50% of his body. He was smoking hash with a family member when he dropped a joint roach.

"Mother's husband's daughter. Showed up on two hours notice with her boyfriend and said boyfriend's German Shepherd.

They stayed the night, then went to see her grandparents. Taking our entire supply of dog food with them. For two days.

Because her dad is such a narcisistic twatwaffle, I had to purchase my own separate groceries rather than just toss money into a collective fund for the whole household.

Now because her father never punished her, she also grew up to be a narcissistic twatwaffle, and as a result I had to explicitly mark the food I purchased.

Which didn't matter, because she'd eat and drink my stuff anyway.

So would mom's husband. Despite him having thrown a fit over food that resulted in me purchasing my own food in the first place.

So yeah, this wonderful human being threw a shit fit one night because I figured that he was a decent human being and had made a plate of food for my mother since she was working. When she got home I asked if I could have it, and since she was starting a vegan thing she said I could.

Nope. His seconds. He threw a goddamn temper tantrum over two pork chops and a baked potato.

So that particular weekend Daughter+Daughter's BF+Mom's Hubby+Mom's Hubby's BFF were all eating my leftover spaghetti, despite it being my quite clearly labelled spaghetti. That I had bought, paid for, and cooked myself. They're literally stealing food from a disabled dude on foodstamps.

After the daughter left, while his buddy was still there I told him he needed to pay me back for the food they'd eaten and the pop his daughter and her BF had drank.

""OMG! MY DAUGHTER IS NOT A POP STEALER! SHE MUST NOT'VE KNOWN THAT THEY WERE YOURS!""

Which is what he'd said the last time. So in order to get at my sodas they would literally have had to remove two strips of masking tape that said ""VK'S SODA, DO NOT DRINK!""

So I told him that if his daughter wasn't a pop stealer she was either blind, illiterate, or mentally retarded.

""OH MY GOD, THEY'RE LIKE FIFTY CENTS!""

And they'd drunken eight of them. That's four bucks. Or, you know, about the same value of foodstuffs that you'd pitched a fit over and forced me to purchase and maintain my own separate stock of food.

And despite dropping by fewer times than I can count on my fingers while I was living there, she insisted on having the maintain a bedroom there, in which no one else was allowed to sleep.

Daughter there twice a year? ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE A BEDROOM! My siblings and niece there every other weekend? FUCK THEM, THEY CAN SLEEP ON THE COUCH!""",153

"got across the border at around midnight. restaurant owner in muriqqa or something pushed some tables together and let me sleep in the corner. in the morning I caught a few rides til I was close to tirana. 

I was absentmindedly standing on the street with my thumb out and I take my phone out to check the time. At the same time a car pulls over to pick me up. There are two other hitchhikers, a cop in the front seat and a younger student in the back. He speaks a little english.

He is interested in my phone (iphone) and asks to see it. he turns it over a few times in his hands, glances at the cop up front, and hands it back to me. He then starts trying to buy it from me. I try to explain that I have photos and stuff on it and I'm not interested in selling it. 

We stop to let out the cop, and the student gets out too. He has a conversation on the phone, and as he gets back in the car (the rear, with me, despite the fact that the cop left) he says ""I love you, I love you"" to the person on the other end of the line. which is weird cause why would his girlfriend be speaking english?

anyway as we keep driving he says my clothes are dirty, that I look hungry, and that I should come over to his house to eat and wash my clothes. Which I'd been doing for hundreds of miles of hitchhiking. So I said sure and got out with him just inside tirana.

so we step out onto the dirt shoulder of the highway, and he leads me up a bridge over the road. As we get to the middle a beefy albanian dude comes up from the other side and I stop dead in my tracks.

I realize when he was calling his ""girlfriend"", he was actually calling his friend to come mug me. so I smile and say goodbye and start walking down the other way, and as soona s I get to the top of the staircase back down to the highway I'm kicked from behind. me and my fully loaded backpack fly down the entire flight to the bottom of the steps. Didn't hurt myself but my contax g2 rangefinder was broken. anyway I start walking away hastily and then follow me to a cafe, I go inside and at first ask for policija, telephone, but they don't understand, so I ask for a taxi and a coffee. which is the same in every language apparently. they were waiting for me outside, presumably for me to walk somewhere without witnesses or something, and I ran to the cab and locked the door behind me.

We lived in a tiny flat without a dining table so they bought a beautiful one with them and let us keep it after as well as lots of other goodies. But apart from that, he was such a wonderful guy to us and when Gordon had finished teaching my mum how to cook paella, we all sat down at the table (my mum, him, me, one of my mum's friends) and ate it all together and discussed random shit for like an hour while the crew packed everything up.

"My brother got married a few years ago, and it was a clusterfuck from day one. His fiance was nuts - seriously, she was diagnosed with various mental health disorders early on in their relationship. Between the two of them, they essentially estranged everyone in my family before the wedding. My parents, who were funding pretty much the entire thing, ultimately decided to cut their support off about three months before the wedding. My brother and his fiance (mostly the fiance) then wrote an email to everyone invited to the wedding calling out my parents for their ""lack of support"". This essentially fractured the family. Ultimately, about 60 people showed up to the wedding (only the most immediate members of my family). Bear in mind that I have a huge family -weddings for other cousins of mine have been in the ballpark of 250+ attendees. 

The day of the wedding was a continuation of how horrible everything leading up to it was. My brother and his fiance stiffed payment for the officiant and failed to pay the caterers for food. Because of that, we were literally only served with a few platters of vegetables - and these were paid for by my parents on the spot. 

These are only a few of the horrible details that made up my brother's marriage to his now ex-wife. That whole relationship was a disaster, but the wedding was an especially bad episode for our family. ",286

"Be single and work on yourself until you're genuinely happy being single. That might include finding new hobbies, getting in shape, therapy, new friends, trying harder at school or your career, what have you. When you're genuinely happy and satisfied being single, you won't get into relationships just because you can, and you won't stay in relationships that aren't actually making you happier. 

I realized I was truly ready for a full-fledged, adult relationship when an attractive, generally cool friend liked me, and I didn't date her. There was nothing wrong with her, but it didn't feel quite right. I didn't feel the need to plug that void with her because there was no longer a void. There'd be other girls and I'd be perfectly happy in the mean time.

Everyone will experience it to a degree. It is different, but the same for everyone.

You are not young anymore, but you are also not old. You have come to terms with what your life has become, what you have become. You work a shit job, but it pays the bills. Each day blurs into the next, same routine over and over. 

Your belongings and property own you. Your spouse is not who they were when you met, but you are stuck with each other. You both have been unhappy for a long time. You haven't had sex for so long that sexual frustration has subsided and you've become mentally castrated. You're not even interested by sex. And at this point your genitals don't even respond to any kind of attempted arousal, save for the once-in-a-blue-moon lonely, sad masterbation. After some time, even masterbation is a distant memory. You don't want to leave them because you are used to each other. Besides, you just plain don't want to be lonely. Your kids are off doing their thing. You know that your dreams died with your youthfulness in your mid-thirties. You wanted to change the world. You watch the news and it's the same shit over and over again. Each day blurs into the next. 

Your body is shit and you feel like shit, but eating something delicious is the highlight of your week or maybe even your month because you mostly eat bland food that is too salty and the drinks are too sugary. You wake up, you go to work, you come home, you eat, you sleep. You do what you are told. Same thing everyday. Each day blurs into the next. 

You want to change but you are in debt so you keep plodding along. After a while you become numb. You stick to the routine. Each day blurs into the next. 

One day you wake up and look at yourself in the mirror. You are old now. Ten, twenty years has passed. How did this happen. You would like to end this, this ""life"", but the religion that you don't believe in anymore says you'll go to hell. Besides, who will be there for your spouse? So fuck it, you stay, but you are unhappy. You've been unhappy for years, but you are numb. Even pain is a welcomed sensation at this point. The days get shorter and still you plod along. Each day blurs into the next. 

At first, days are indistinguishable from one another, now, you can't tell apart years.

""Thinking about their lives, eh?"" he asked. 

""How did you know?"" I responded, perplexed.

""That one over there, the guy with the green jacket? He's actually a millionaire. Won the lottery a couple years back. On his first ever bought ticket, too. The woman right behind him? She only recently graduated high school.""

I was wondering how he knew all these people. I tried asking him, but he just cut me off and kept going.

""The cashier? Broke every bone in his left arm when he was 12. Skateboarding accident.""

""How many more of these people do you know?"" I inquired finally.

""Another one,"" he responded. I then realized who was talking to me. It was DJ Khaled. He told me that he once got the guy making coffee to record him playing basketball at the local court for his Snapchat story.

He finished his coffee, pointed at me, said ""you smart"" and left. ",1186

"When my dad was 15, he woke up out of a dead sleep covered in sweat and shaking. His bedside clock said 3:02 am. He looked over and saw his grandmother, who lived with him at the time, standing at his doorway. She stared at him for a second and then suddenly walked away down the hall. My dad said he had never felt such dread and fear in his life. He jumped out of bed and went to her room and she was in her bed; she had died in her sleep. My father woke up and had seen her ghost the moment she died. He's fifty-three years old now, and he says that every night ever since that night he wakes up at 3:02 am on the dot. 
Here's the creepy part.
Ever since I was a baby, all the up way to now (I'm 19 years old), I wake up at 3:02 am every night on the dot sweaty and terrified, though I don't know why. I have an older sister and two younger brothers. I'm the only one of my father's children that this has been passed on to.",646

"I experienced the most complicated Catch-22 I've ever seen when we were dealing with people building our house. Let's see if I can remember all the parts...

- The bank couldn't approve a construction/mortgage loan without plans from the builder.
- The builder couldn't provide the plans without an easement guaranteeing rights to a shared side of the property.
- The county wouldn't approve the easement (or maybe the lawyer wouldn't write up the easement) without an up-to-date survey on the property.
- The county couldn't perform an up-to-date survey without an up-to-date title on the property.
- The lawyer couldn't perform the title search without something from the county records department, I never fully understood what.
- The county records wouldn't provide that without proof that I own the property. Which I didn't yet, because the bank hadn't approved the construction/mortgage loan.

"Arc flashes are no joke.

I did a literature review of arc flash injuries and fatalities in the rural electric industry. With only a few exceptions (and some really crappy luck), nobody wearing all of their PPE (personal protective equipment) and wearing it properly died. The vast majority of deaths were people wearing no PPE at all. Their clothes (often winter jackets) caught fire and they died several weeks later of infection or organ failure as a result of comprehensive burns. Definitely not at the top of anybody's list of favourite ways to go. People who didn't catch fire very often made a full or nearly full recovery.

You can't prevent arc flashes 100% of the time, so you have to assume its going to happen and take precautions. Your buddy's training probably did save his life. Statistics suggest that an untrained operator's odds are not good.
