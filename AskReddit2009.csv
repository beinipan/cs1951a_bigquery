Why doesn't Obama instruct his DEA head and AG to stand down on the raids until a scientific study can be presented to either establish or discredit (for once using actual scientific evidence) that marijuana causes a clear harm or public health risk, or that it doesn't? How much political currency would he lose for funding such a study when countless other studies lately find it valid and useful as medicine?

Is it so difficult to simply establish a series of positions on these matters that moves *towards* changing them, instead of becoming even more deeply entrenched with them? I am thrilled with his current efforts on health care; I'm not entirely ungrateful...",3

I'm not talking about the people who have honest issues with the healthcare reform bill(s) or are wary of too much government control.  I'm talking about the people who will make up any excuse not to trust our president.  Pardon me for my sensitivity, but it feels an awful lot like these people don't trust Obama simply because he's black.  And what that boils down to is another situation in which mainstream, white America is telling black people that we aren't trustworthy just because of the color of our skin.  That somehow, our skin precludes us from having everyone's best interests at heart, even though every minority group in America has given upperclass white men the benefit of the doubt on this from day one.  

That's why there's a double-standard for white pride.  Because as far as majority opinion is considered, white people have no reason to be ashamed.

"How Ignorant are you my friend. HE has been an inspiration to MLK and Obama, The president recently said if he were to have dinner with one person from the history, it would be Gandhi

Statement by President Obama on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary

On behalf of the American people, I want to express appreciation for the life and lessons of Mahatma Gandhi on the anniversary of his birth. This is an important moment to reflect on his message of non-violence, which continues to inspire people and political movements across the globe.

We join the people of India in celebrating this great soul who lived a life dedicated to the cause of advancing justice, showing tolerance to all, and creating change through non-violent resistance.

Americans owe an enormous measure of gratitude to the Mahatma. His teachings and ideals, shared with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on his 1959 pilgrimage to India, transformed American society through our civil rights movement. The America of today has its roots in the India of Mahatma Gandhi and the nonviolent social action movement for Indian independence which he led.

Tomorrow, as we remember the Mahatma on his birthday, we must renew our commitment to live his ideals and to celebrate the dignity of all human beings.

Just goes to show that the Nobel committee has a much better sense of context than they're given credit for.

Seriously, a mere 50 years ago or so it was nearly impossible for a black person to attend any college except for a handful of black-only institutions. Does anyone really think 50 years is enough to fix racial inequality in the US?

Additionally, a diverse campus is a benefit to all students. College life should prepare students for the real world. That includes learning how to interact with people of other races and cultures. Just as we provide international students with scholarships in part to create a culturally diverse campus, we also provide racial minorities with scholarships to create a racially diverse campus. Many talented black students would otherwise be unable to attend pricier colleges that are historically mostly white.

Khamenei has laid down the law to the opposition at Friday prayers.  He has validated the election and put his status on the line.  It's going to be like Burma all over again.  Since they are already pariah status, they have nothing to lose.  In the aftermath of a national trauma like the one experts expect to see, the opposition will be devastated, cowed and afraid.

When that Persian ""Tiananmen incident"" (as so many analysts are expecting) occurs, we should allow Israel to bomb Natanz as well as other sites in Iran, including Ahmadinejad's and Khamenei's houses.

Iran is using this sham election to draw out the opposition (like Mao's Hundred Flowers Campaign, followed by the Cultural Revolution) as well as **buy more time for their nuclear program**; they have *no* intention of negotiating.

&gt;
&gt;Next door to Narayana, Dr. Shetty built a 1,400-bed cancer hospital and a 300-bed eye hospital, which share the same laboratories and blood bank as the heart institute. His family-owned business group, Narayana Hrudayalaya Private Ltd., reports a 7.7% profit after taxes, or slightly above the 6.9% average for a U.S. hospital, according to American Hospital Association data.

&gt;Dr. Shetty's success rates appear to be as good as those of many hospitals abroad. Narayana Hrudayalaya reports a 1.4% mortality rate within 30 days of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, one of the most common procedures, compared with an average of 1.9% in the U.S. in 2008, according to data gathered by the Chicago-based Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

And how much does all of this cost?

&gt;His flagship heart hospital charges $2,000, on average, for open-heart surgery, compared with hospitals in the U.S. that are paid between $20,000 and $100,000, depending on the complexity of the surgery.

This is what Entrepreneurs do in a Capitalist market.  Economies of scale allow for lower prices.  People take risks with their wealth -- sometimes for social or even altruistic purposes -- and can still make a profit.

The AMA is, in effect, a guild or union.  It [calculates how many doctors it thinks the US needs](http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-03-02-doctor-shortage_x.htm) and allows only so many people to graduate.  This creates an artificial shortage of doctors, thus keeping doctor's wages high.

Someone submitted to reddit a link to a map showing the insurance costs for medical testing in the US; I unfortunately cannot find it in my archives.  The costs were highest in the coastal, liberal states. Why?  That is where most of the money is concentrated.  The article also went on to state that doctors prescribe these tests for both [defensive reasons and to placate patients](http://patients.about.com/od/followthemoney/f/FAQdoctortests.htm) who now spend too much time online reading WebMD and forming their own treatments instead of listening to their doctor who, as someone else here pointed out, have spent 12 years in medical school to learn their jobs.  There are so many people telling doctors how to do their jobs that [prescriptions of placebos](http://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000109mag-talbot7.html) are increasing just to give people pills and make them shut up.

Insurance companies are for-profit businesses, and there is nothing wrong with that.  But insurance companies are not necessarily the bad guys here.  In fact, [last year, Medicare was the largest denier of claims](http://blog.heritage.org/2009/10/06/medicare-largest-denier-of-health-care-claims/).  But because doctors order so many extra and unnecessary tests, and because of governments regulating who must be treated without saying who pays, you end up with situations like this doctor in Manhattan who has [two doors to the same office](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33863680/ns/health-health_care/) that treat patients differently.  Why?  Because in one door people pay cash at cost, and the other gets paid by insurance (including Medicare/Medicaid) at below cost.

So, how do things work out?  I'll put on my prediction hat.  Let's say the Health Care bill passes.  Obama has clearly stated that he means to reduce costs by limited treatments to only necessary procedures.  This means that the testing done that shows women should not get mammograms until 50 would likely become government policy, even though [women are screaming for it to be covered before age 50](http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/112309dnmetbrinkermam.2e5c30508.html).  In addition, if you are overweight or a smoker you will likely be charged a premium for the services (that is, your taxes only cover so much, and if you're fat you'll pay out of pocket).  If the government gets single payer, people will drop their private insurance because they're already paying taxes for the public insurance, creating a de facto universal healthcare.  The costs for the program will be underestimated by at least 10 fold, just like in [Massachusetts](http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/11/18/success_could_put_health_plan_in_the_red/).  The costs will go through the roof and service will suck while the AMA has to ramp up the number of doctors to meet the needs.  We'll be waiting at least 10 years to get the number of doctors required, during which time health services will go to shit.

I am against this public option not only because I believe a more free version of Capitalism can work -- and there are plenty of example to prove this -- but also because there is no one in Congress that lobbies for The People.  Every interest is represented by some group -- lawyers, doctors, insurance, medical devices, etc.  -- but nobody there represents the average Joe.  You might think that is what your Congress Critter is for, but they are more interested in getting re-elected and running their own fiefdom than they are in satisfying their constituency.  How can you claim otherwise when the [Bank Bailout was passed](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/jul2008/econ-j28.shtml) when voters called their representatives and told them they were [100 to 1 against it](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1845512,00.html)?

I am against the bill only because I know Congress is going to screw it up.

P.S. I apologize for linking to About.com, but it did have a good summary of why doctors order so many tests.

It seems to me books did not used to reference many trademarked items.  I listened to an interesting segment on NPR once where some authors talked about the cell-phone dilemma.  The problem with giving their characters cell phones were two.  First, just a call on the phone had much less drama than putting all the characters in the same room.  Second, when phones first came out it was an item that might ""date"" the story too easily.  The same could be said with trademarked items ... in 15 years rereading that same book Firefox (FSM forbid) could not be around anymore, in 30 maybe you don't even know what a Firefox is and now the story makes no sense.

&gt; ""Have you ever read up on Illinois or Chicago politics?""

No, I haven't. All I know is 2nd hand stories I've heard that its pretty dirty. Yes, I realize Obama coming out of that environment without being tainted in some way is very unlikely.

&gt; ""Has public culture fallen so low?""

Yes. Yes it has. ;)

I hope I didnt seem like I was trying to lower standards. But compared to what we had for 8 years, its refreshing to have anything even marginally better. 

Regarding what he's done so far:..... I'm with you on being leery of government management of large projects. I work in a municipal government and even small city projects can be riddled with ineptitude and waste. But I don't think thats solely Obama's fault. It's inherent through the system (top to bottom). I do give Obama credit for tackling the big issues and having vision to plan far enough ahead. These big projects may not even get done until after his presidency, but if he lays a good foundation, he'll be remembered for putting us on a better path. That definitely takes leadership. 

&gt; ""I view choosing between the two (parties) as a choice about whether I'd rather be shot in the leg or stabbed in the shoulder.""

I completely agree with you. Neither party is significantly better than the other. All I'm saying is the mood in the country now is noticeably more positive than before. I don't blame that on Republican administration per se.. I think it was a collective malaise/combination of factors (administration, unpopular wars, housing bubble, 9/11,etc)..

I'd do everything- naked. I'd hire a few whores, stay OUT of the house all the time. I'd go out and buy a gun, I'd shoot random things somewhere I won't be caught. I'd go skydiving. I wouldn't sleep. I would buy a puppy and a kitten. I would go horseback riding. Fuck working out, I'm buying every single junk food item I can think of. I'd have a backpack with me. I would borrow a shitload of money, or use my credit card to the max. I'd always have a backpack with a lot of money, a gun, a lot of food I love, some lube, and assorted other things. Now that that's out of the way, here's my schedule.

Extravagance. I'd wake up early as fuck, and go to the mall. I'd run to a supermarket with my backpack and buy every food I've ever wanted. I'd fill my backpack up, and have bags filled with this food. I'd run and put it in my car. Next, I'd go to an Electronics store. I'd buy the biggest television there, and transport it to my car. I'd go to a sex shop, and buy shit. I'd buy one of every item in Wal-Mart, until I run out of my 50,000 dollars. This should take 3 or 4 hours. It should only be 1 pm. I'd hire about 30 whores to come to my house and 10 of them would set up the furniture and TV's and shit, naked. The others would have sex with me multiple times, as much as I can get done in two hours. I'd have a redbull or two, and get back on my way. I'd go do weed, or LSD, and see where that gets me. Considering I'm back to my senses in 2 more hours, it'd be around 5 pm. Now, I'd go buy a car. An amazing car. I'd ride in it to the nearest place that lets me skydive, and I'd skydive. I'd be doing all this wearing a suit. I'd get a mohawk. I'd go locate some porn stars, and pay them the amount of money they want to come to my house. They'd come, and the whores would still be there. I'd tell them to sit tight. I'd put on Dexter, and let the whores do whatever they want. I would go to a swimming pool and jump in it. It's probably 9pm now. My parents would worry about me. I'd explain to them. They wouldn't believe me. I'd tell them that I believe in God to the fullest, and I will go to heaven if I do what I'm doing. I'd buy my parents everything they've ever wanted, and let my brother into my house, with the whores. There's cake there, and videogames. Now, I'd tell facebook about a party at my house. Everyone who comes gets 1,000 dollars. They just have to come naked. Next, I'd go take a can of spraypaint and graffitti my house, as I don't want to get arrested on my first day. After more partying, I'd go outside naked, and lay on the grass while being fed chocolate cake and fanta, getting a blowjob from 8 girls. Then, I'd fill my hot tub with fanta and take a bath in it. It's probably 4 am now. I'd drink a red bull or two, and have all the girls I had a crush on have sex with me, if they won't, I'd pay them. The music on the stereo systems would be, well, who cares, I'd hire a band to play live. Now, I'd crash, but I'd tell everyone at my party to wake me up at 11 am, and they'll get 1,000 dollars each. If they wake me up with a blowjob, they'll get 5,000.

 More fun: I'd go down to Disneyworld on an airplane and bring all of my whores. I'd pay them, of course. I would go to the bathroom with one of them, and join the mile high club. I'd come back, and sit down, and pay the stewardess 400 dollars to sing my favorite song. I'd have about 300,000 dollars left right about now. I'd get a hotel at Disneyworld, and get a fast pass. I'd have sex on a roller coaster. I'd go to the zoo and buy a llama. I'd depart from Disneyworld. It's probably 5 pm now. The whores can leave, I'm going to Vegas. I get to a great hotel at about 8 pm, and hire a new batch of whores. I have a 15-some, if that's possible, and marry one of the whores. I'd go to a nude beach, and just be nude there, and jack off, and do some drugs. I'd go to a stripclub, and make the bouncer give me a piggyback ride. I'd confess my love for all of my crushes who weren't at my party, via phone. I'd take a plane to Hollywood, and just meet Eddie Murphy. I'd have sex with Megan Fox, no matter what it takes. I'd crash, and go to sleep on the pavement, naked, waking up the next day at 12 pm.

Extremes:I'd do everything I'd ever dreamed of. I'd bungee jump off the highest ledge, I'd ride my bike off a cliff, I'd parasail, all safely though. I'd meet Obama, and introduce him to reddit. I'd go to Greece, Spain, basically every single country, and just step in it, and go back on the plane, and keep going, until I got back to New York. This will take a while. On the plane, I would be relaxing, and playing simon says with everyone, after I paid them.

 Kindness: After sleeping on the plane, back in New York, I'd take my backpack with loads of money, gift certificates, and candy, to the city. I'd walk into every third store on my side of the street, and give everyone 100 dollars. I'd do this until I was out, and then give people candy and stuff. I'd gather up every homeless person back to my place, and have a party with them, free food, free sex, and hire some whores for them. I would just relax for the rest of today. I'd make a list on my arms and body with tattoos of what I have to do next. Considering I have 2 and a half days left, I get serious. For the rest of the day, I make the list.

Revenge: For all the injustice and mistreatment in my life, I seek revenge. I go and find where everyone is, and even though this might not be revenge, I pay man number one to get a tattoo saying ""I love Nickelback."" I feel this is sufficient. I go to the next persons house, which is my teacher. I bribe her to fuck me. Next person, my ex. I bribe her to fuck me, wondering if I should get her pregnant, but I pull out, and wear a condom. Whatever. I'm going entirely crazy now, so, I do some more weed, what can it hurt. Now, the police are after me. I run. I do all I can. I'm going for broke now. I move to Paris, which takes another day.

 This is it. I pull out my machine gun, which is extremely light, because I had it custom made. It's small too. It might not even be a machine gun, but what do I know. I take a test shot at a can. I walk, flaunting my money in bad neighborhoods, waiting for people to try and mug me. I kill them. It was only self-defense. I'm extremely crazy now, and helicopters are looking for me. My gun has a speaker which plays 80's music hits, so I'm easy to find. I'm just not going to give up without a fight. A meteor is coming close to the Earth, and everyone knows what's going on. They try to do what I've done in the past week, but it's too late. Instead of them being burned alive slowly, I put everyone out of their misery, in an act that I feel had good intent. In a sick game of duck hunt, I kill everyone I see. Everyone. I feel the heat of the meteor coming at me, but I won't stop. What's this? As I'm walking past a cemetery, zombies arise. What is this!? I thought the meteor would be sufficient enough to end humankind. I shoot the zombies and run. I run as fast as I can, not knowing why I still want to live. As the zombies are coming after me, It starts to rain, hard. The rain turns to hail, and volcanoes arise out of the ground. The volcanoes shoot flaming man-eating horses out of them. I run. I drop my machine gun and run. I run back to my house, which is close, and find all of the homeless dead. There has been an icy flood which has killed them all. All I want is to have sex one last time. I can't find one more human alive. I run to a cliff, that I am quite familiar with, thinking about ending my life. I'm going to die anyways. I thirst for sex. A carnivorous fire horse appears behind me. I do not know of this. As to cure my lust, I start to jack off. I hear the horse behind me, and I fall. Falling to my death, and thinking about what a great week I had.",4
"You don't, you can't possibly win. Having logic on your side is like having really nice rims in a drag-race -- it won't help, and if anything, will just hinder you. You need to just focus on the fact hat they're your family, enjoy your mom's pot roast and sweet potatoes, and avoid politics as much as possible.

"I don't think that shows that the country is divided. I think it shows that the two main political machines are so highly tuned that they're essentially deadlocked. They both know exactly how to manipulate public opinion and work the electoral college system, but because they both have this knowledge and equal resources neither can clearly win. (until Obama's massive fundraising efforts tipped the scale in his favour)

I think the vast difference in the opinions espoused on either side are more telling, even if the vote was as unbalanced as 70-30.

Edit: What I'm thinking of here is this quote from [Al Gore](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1622015-2,00.html): After a detailed review of all the polling information and careful testing of potential TV commercials, the anticipated response from my opponent's campaign and the planned response to the response, my advisers made a recommendation and prediction that surprised me with its specificity: ""If you run this ad at this many 'points' [a measure of the size of the advertising buy], and if Ashe responds as we anticipate, and then we purchase this many points to air our response to his response, the net result after three weeks will be an increase of 8.5% in your lead in the polls... I authorized the plan and was astonished when three weeks later my lead had increased by exactly 8.5%.""

I'm not trying to say there's some vast conspiracy by the ""elite"" to subjugate the masses. I'm just saying that their ability to model the psychology of human beings _in bulk_ is what makes election races so competitive. If all each party could do was write down, once, their proposed agenda have it sent to each home in america, do you really think the races would be neck and neck? ",-1

The Nobel Prize is often given to leaders in the *middle* of complicated or important struggles for peace -- thus Arafat, and Mandela/de Klerk (who got their prize *before* the end of apartheid), and many others.  The prize isn't intended to reward peacemakers -- it's not like the prize in physics -- it's intended to *create peace* by supporting embattled leaders who are trying to bring peace about, or by encouraging/pressuring leaders on the brink.  So no, Obama doesn't 'deserve' any kind of achievement award for making peace.  He might, later -- but he doesn't today.  The Nobel Peace Prize, however, isn't exactly an achievement award, and I think the motivations of the prize committee go much further beyond getting wrapped up in election rhetoric or liking Barack Obama personally.",1

Heh, I would have believed that a few years ago, but the internet is getting scarier all the time.

But seriously, I agree with your points heartily and especially appreciate your kind words. That said, there are 2 reasons I still would rather maintain as much anonymity as I can.

1) Even if this conversation is one that no potential future employer, client, or colleague could find objectionable, a quick search of my reddit history will turn up a laundry list of my own personal crazy, contentious, offensive, and generally unpalatable political opinions. In my line of work the most successful people are those that keep their personal political preferences far away from their work. I pride myself with working with equal success with both sides of the aisle, and have enormous respect for many of the talented folks working diligently in both parties. I am not willing to take even the most minute chance of jeopardizing those relationships that I rely on day to day.

2) This is a bit illogical, but the negative connotation of ""lobbying"" has made a vicious cycle of secrecy amongst lobbyists. Because public perception is that we're about 1 step above Satan, (even Pres Obama has barred ANY registered lobbyist from appointed positions in the administration - a move that has kept countless smart, qualified, passionate individuals from getting jobs) politicians generally don't like to brag about being influenced or even cooperating with us. We're kind of Washington's dirty little secret, which is regrettable. 99% of registered lobbyists are incredibly honest, decent folks - because you typically don't last long in this business if you're perceived as a bullshit artist. But the other 1% has made us pariahs. Thanks a lot, Abramoff.",4

"Because in standard American rhetoric, there's no difference between economic and political systems. The actual meaning of ""socialism"" has been hollowed out, but it's meant to imply that if you have a socialist government, you're going to have no rights and tanks will be rolling through the streets. It just comes from the fact that our Cold War enemies were always talking about socialism. It's right in their name, the Union of Soviet **Socialist** Republics. But that logic, you can claim that Democracy is evil because our enemies were also in the German **Democratic** Republic. ""Socialism"" is more convenient to spin though.

What I love is that, when there's a major corporate bail out, for example (which happens all the time, incidentally. Obama's not doing anything new), the politicians are only called socialists if the pundits disagree with it. When they're in favor of the bail outs or other forms of corporate welfare, it's hailed as a triumph to preserve the wonders of the free market.

I believe that Vietnam was a mistake much like our current occupation, but pulling out of Vietnam before it was finished made us look bad then and like you said, we accomplished nothing by leaving except making the lives lost even more meaningless.  I think if we leave now, we'll not only be making the same identical mistake twice, but also accomplishing nothing yet again.  It doesn't take someone with expertise to know that would be a negative thing for our country.

I was against the war when it started, but I was very young.  Now I have a different opinion when it pertains to leaving.  I wish we hadn't started.  I wish it were over.  But I realize by staying we are probably doing more good than leaving the power vacuum for the Taliban to crawl back in to.  I already said I hate armchair Generals, so I have no clue as to how to fix our situation there and I won't pretend to have one.  But I still believe leaving has dire consequences.

It is my (humble) opinion that despite all of the difference of opinion that goes on around here, most of the real heated disagreement comes from how a comment is worded rather than its content. Very few people on reddit 100% hate all conservative ideas and immediately downvote anything that is not pro-Obama. On the other hand many people immediately downvote something with a logical fallacy, sensationalist misrepresentation of analogy, or misplaced anger at Obama. Proper wording and logical construction of argument could fix all of these problems. Not to mention that things like kind body language and caring tone tend to get lost over the internet.

Also, if there's one aspect of the label ""liberal"" that bothers me,  it's the blind idealism spouted by some. Everybody on death row isn't just a misunderstood minority who had no opportunities growing up and was forced into a malicious life of crime and murder just to survive, only to be convicted by a racist jury.

""Republicans in Congress vilified Democrats for both the overall size and the number of earmarks attached to the $410 billion omnibus appropriations bill that Obama signed Wednesday.

http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/03/republican_earmarks_pork.html

If the party in power was MORE partisan, it would mean freezing out the opposition party from earmarks and appropriations and would likely result in LESS spending.

"&gt; Sure, I could scoop shit out of a pool in 12 months too, but that doesn't necessarily disinfect the water.

You sure as hell aren't going to disinfect it if you don't start scooping shit.

&gt; I think military withdraws from conflict zones (where we have our hands very deep in and muddy) are an extremely subtle business.

Because everyone tells you this is so, and because it appeals to your emotional needs for things to be complex. If these issues were at all simple, you'd have to own up to at least being supportive of atrocity, if only indirectly.

If you stumble across a rape in progress, you don't try to be diplomatic, or make up excuses about how just grabbing him and ripping him out of there could be even more traumatic. ""Just look! We did that with a few rape victims, and they never recovered! We have to slowly ease the rapists penis out of her over a period of 5-12 years, and perhaps replace it a UN peacekeeping force's penis in the meantime, or it will be chaos!"".

And I hope you find this analogy horribly crass and offensive... because the idea of people dying in Iraq and Afghanistan is the same to me.

Because he has another option... to simply do nothing. To leave those places. If your ""fix"" is worse than the injury itself, you refrain from fixing, and hope that it heals itself. He's doing the political equivalent of drilling holes in a patient's head to release the demons.

Keeping this in mind, it is a well known fact that the ONLY way you can stop someone from tracking your cellphone is to take the battery out.  Even if you shut off your phone, the firmware could be rigged to look like the phone is off after you have turned it off, but it is still listening and tracking your location.  

With that said, Apple has created one of the most popular mobile phones ever, now with convenient GPS technology.  As we all know, the iPhone is currently offered EXCLUSIVELY through AT&amp;T.  However, what is so weird about the iPhone compared to other mobile devices?  The battery is locked into the device, impossible for consumers to remove it, thereby, making it impossible to stop someone from tracking you.

(1) I have no idea about the specifics of Obama's healthcare plan but I have seen comments to the effect that it is nothing particularly like the NHS, which seems far more believable than not, as it seems logical your govt would create a system attuned to current American needs and one that was suitable to transition to from your past/current system, rather than wholesale adopt the system from a completely different country (demographics, population distribution, taxation system, etc etc).

(2) Even if your proposed system was extremely close the NHS, asking one random Brit about the NHS would not be especially helpful.  Although it is N for National, it is not a homogenous monoculture, as authority is partially delegated to [PCTs and other types of trust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_trust), or in plain English, quality and availability of care can be quite different depending on where you live (which our tabloids like to refer to as ""Postcode lottery"" etc).

(3) Asking Brits about the NHS is always a funny one - generally/anecdotally if you ask them something like ""Is the NHS good?"" they will rip on it with a list of gripes about MRSA etc (we do love a grumble), whereas if you ask them ""Was your last experience with NHS treatment good?"" they will be far more positive.

"Okay, this may be a bit long, so bear with me. Basically, what you're describing is what I'd call a politically correct mentality; in short, it's the over-acknowledgement or deference to the opinions of various groups approved by 'society', which in this case is actually a sub-group of a society that's taken upon itself to police the rest of us. 

Social norms certainly do create inequalities for people, but it's really only politically correct to bring up the problems of certain special groups. Black or latino poverty is often addressed, but white poverty (such as is present in Appalachia, or much of the Southeast) is ignored... in fact, such people are often referred to as 'trailer trash' or 'white trash'. Only the 'popular' suffering groups get positive attention; the others are ignored or mocked. (I'm of course discussing the dominant form of political correctness in the US today, the liberal sort. However, all sorts of PC attitudes exist all along the political spectrum, some rather specialized.)

Besides being one-sided, political correctness has a controlling mentality. To sum it up: ""If people won't do what we want, we'll change the culture by making what they say unacceptable."" Israel has tried to do this by yelling ""anti-semite"" at anyone who disagrees with its policy for any reason, various American churches claim persecution because a gay group has protested about some policy or other, Muslims complain that no one may say anything they might not like about the prophet Mohammed, the Bush administration slandered anyone against the war in Iraq by claiming that they were unpatriotic, and now whenever I read a debate about Obama on Reddit, any criticism (warranted or not) is met with cries of ""idiot, jackass, Republican fucktard, etc"". A political dialogue cannot occur when one side doesn't like what the other is saying and then yells ""stop talking"", while refusing to engage in further debate.

Quite simply, you don't have the right not to be offended by what others say or do. Now, it's one thing is someone is going out of his way to intentionally harass somebody else, I'd say most of us would step in in such circumstances... but going around and policing others' use of language is just being a busybody. If you don't like someone using a certain term, feel free to say so, and then explain to them why. But don't assume that it's 'not okay' just because you happen to feel that way. Others have just as much of a right to their opinions as you do.

As for language and culture, you really ought to look closely at the emotional weight attached to these words and the context in which they're used. Meanings do change over time (the word 'gay' is a great example of this) and I think that when used in a certain context, these words are no more harmful than many others that have passed into our language over time and become fairly innocuous. (""Gypped"" comes to mind.) Now, if you feel that someone doesn't really get the distinction between one use of the word and another, feel free to enlighten them, and then let them make their own decisions.",1

Just what I want to hear. I looked for a minute in disgust and of course said something about it out loud to the nerd sitting next to me. He likely a) is christian too b) has no issue with the president discussing his personal religious beliefs during a press conference on CNN, or c) didnt give a shit either way.

Too bad. I was disgusted, and he was going to hear about. I walked out of the room before I could even hear his response. 

I wish he was up there speaking about islam the way he was speaking about christ-lam just to see how people would react.

"That sounds like an interesting idea, but I'm not sure about it.  There are powerful people in the world with some fairly crazy obsessions.  I'll think about it.

I'll answer the ""defenseless"" question briefly since I didn't explain myself earlier.  I don't think you'll like what I'm going to say, though.

In retrospect this is obvious, but it appears that now, in 2009, it isn't.  For decades the national governments of the First World (caps, right?) have been slowly slicing away at personal freedoms.  This trend is beginning to accelerate, and will eventually result in de facto dictatorships in nearly every nation on Earth, including the United States.  You'll still have elections, at least here, but they won't mean anything since the only choices you have are all vetted and approved of by the same power structures.  That's already true in most nations right now, but people simply refuse to believe it.  In their minds whatever the government does is okay so long as it's their guy at the helm, and not ""the other guy"".  In this sense the vast majority of the population is perfectly okay with losing their freedom and actively participate in its demise.  From an outsiders point of view, you not only tolerate a more oppressive national government, you actually desire it and work towards implementing it.  The changes are always incremental, or in some way justifiable, so the number of people alarmed by the trend is always small enough that they can (mostly) be ignored or ridiculed into silence.

Here's an example in your near future:  your national health care plan is going to pass before the end of Obama's first term.  It'll be compulsory and the terms of the health plan will be absolutely awful by any civilized standards.  Everyone will be required to buy insurance and anyone who refuses will be fined.  Those who won't pay the fine will be jailed.

After the health plan will come a national insurance card which you'll be required to carry with you at all times, no exceptions.  It's for your own protection, of course, in case you become so badly injured you can't communicate.  The insurance card will have all of your personal information on it, along with the results of any medical testing you've ever had, including genetic workups.  Because the card is universal and because it carries an enormous amount of personal information, it becomes a national i.d. card in very short order.  Employers will require that you submit your card for scanning when you apply for a job; shortly after that they'll have to do this, because it'll become law (the purported reason being to weed out illegal immigrants).  Now the card carries not only your personal and medical information, but also your employment history.

To many people this doesn't sound too bad, but it's just one link in a very long chain to controlling what you do or don't do, and to keeping tabs on your activities.  It's to acclimate you to having to report your personal information and your activities on demand to both the government and employers, and to carrying this information with you wherever you go.  Police will have the right to stop you and require that you present your card for no reason whatsoever (again, the illegal immigrant issue).

Police powers will grow, as they have been for many years, and very soon it'll be possible for the police to obtain a warrant 'after the fact' if they can prove sufficient cause for suspicion to a judge (this happens during Obama's second term, if I remember correctly).  In practice this means that the police will be able to legally enter and search your home for any reason, getting a rubber-stamp warrant afterwards.  People who object to government policies, even those who just post those objections online, will find themselves the favorite targets of these raids.  Often they'll be arrested on trumped up charges (resisting arrest, obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty, etc.) and as an added insult the police will make a point of destroying a fair bit of their property while conducting their search.

Most people will just ignore all of this, just as they've been doing in decades past.  Most people will claim that the government wouldn't be bothering person X if person X weren't guilty of something, so whatever the government does to them is okay.

There's so much more I could go into, but I need to keep this brief.  By the end of this next decade any sane observer will call the U.S., and most other nations in the First World, ""police states"".  The police can do pretty much anything they want to you, at any time, and there's very little you will be able to do in return.  In fact, trying to do anything will just bring down more misery on your head.  Your neighbors and friends won't come to your rescue because they don't want to attract that same attention to themselves.  And besides, you're person X, right?

The police states will make it their business to silence objections to their policies and institutions through the use of these tools.  We see this all the time in Third World dictatorships so it isn't anything new, it'll just have a more refined veneer in the First World.  The prison population is going to explode, and although the new additions will be charged with a variety of different crimes they will, in fact, be political prisoners.

This situation will become steadily worse until the 2030's.  I don't think anyone can change this future, primarily because I think the vast majority of you actually want this sort of government.  I was very angry about the situation the first time around and was one of the people arrested as a political prisoner (I wrote a book the federal government didn't like), but now I'm just resigned.  This time around I'm going to keep my head down and wait for the whole thing to blow up in the '30's.  I did my part on the first run-through and have no desire to go through all that again.  I've been beaten, jailed, and shot at enough for one lifetime, no matter how long that lifetime is.",3
"... except that while voting for a Presidential election may be statistically meaningless, voting for school board is not.  Voting for your Representative, State Representative, Governor and Mayor are probably statistically meaningless, but it's also ignoring the role that civil society can play in these things - an individual or group of individuals has the power to sway these sorts of elections with enough local activism.

That's why I think local elections are far more important than Presidential elections.  If I voted for Obama or McCain, what does that matter?  Practically zilch.  This is why I'm a conservative (I know that makes me unpopular on reddit) - I'm a believer in the power of local government over the Federal government, and I think far more government should be delegated down to a local level.

It's amazing - go to your local public hospital and ask them - which makes more sense:  people losing their lives because they cannot afford care, losing their homes &amp; careers, losing their ability to be CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF THIS GREAT SOCIETY, or, treating them, their families, perhaps even the occasional alien, for the greater good?

If you only treat those who can pay, you are looking at the fast track to pandemic malady.  **YOU CANNOT PROTECT ONLY A PORTION OF THE POPULATION.**  It doesn't work that way - your kids go to school with the uninsured children.  You work with the uninsured; they clean your bathrooms, they employ you (think about how many business owners forgo their own coverage to make ends meet) or your neighbors, they clean your streets and fix your vehicles.  **THE UNINSURED ARE EVERYWHERE.**  If you disregard public health you are only harming yourself.  

If we cover everyone it **WILL COST** - but the alternative, covering a portion of the population, *will cost even more: you cannot stop a pandemic at the gates of your subdivision!  You cannot halt disease at an income bracket!* - so why pretend that you can by denying life to those that can't afford the crooked insurance system we've built?  

*LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.*  Last I checked, that's what America was about.  Not 'no insurance?  GO DIE.' or even worse, 'Your cancer is a pre-existing condition we do not cover, GO DIE'.  Insurance death panels kill more than 'obamacare' ever will - all in the quest for a **HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN.** 

That's the choice you make when you deny care.  If you do so with open eyes, that's your business (you cold hearted fuck) I suppose, but when pandemic flu kills your children, don't ask why.",3

After saying that, though, I will say that the majority of my opinions are my own. I am affected by public opinion. If I like a book, and I read a review where someone completely and totally bashes it, I'm going to be a little uncertain of how much I like it. Within an hour, though, I'll be back to normal. It's the same with other aspects of entertainment. When it comes to politics, though, I purposefully hold no opinion on nearly everything related.

I have no opinion on Obama, or Glenn Beck's shrieking, or the health care, or any such thing. The reason? Because, as is the nature of people, the supporter will exaggerate the good and understate the bad, and the nay-sayer will exaggerate the bad and downplay the good. Pretty much the one political thing I care about at all is rights and laws related to the LGBT community, and that's simply because I am a part of the community, so it really hits home.

"Depends. I'm the guy who listens, but doesn't have much to say. Contrary to what is commonly thought, I attract more guys than girls when it comes to being a listener. 

First. People complain... a lot. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot wrong with my life but I never complain. My mum taught me to shut the fuck up (though as she's grown more senile...I mean older..she's been transferring quite a bit of complaining to me. There's something to be said when the person who taught you everything begins to unravel into the greatest bullshiter you've ever seen..but yea enough with my mommy issues). People complain a lot on average, but when they're your friend expect that complaining to increase a whole lot.
biggest topics of complaining: money, work, school, relationships. Rarely does it go outside of these three. You'll rarely hear anyone randomly denounce arithmetic for having arbitrary axioms. Contrary to popular belief, politics is actually quite rare in topics of complaining. Even among college students. Most people just don't give a shit about politics in general above superficial things (Bush sucks, Obama is here for your children etc.,).

People like juicy news. Who's sleeping with who? [This strangely number one.].  Who fucked their life with drugs? Who died in that car accident? Who's preggers? An abortion? even better! If a particular piece of news can get people talking for 30 minutes or more, it's considered epic.
These are just examples but people like meaningful and interesting updates on what's going with other people, not because they're nosy but because humans are generally curious and seek knowledge. 
This is why facebook and twitter are very popular. I've personally never encountered this but some people do like to discuss celebrities to a frightening degree as if they're a next door neighbor.  

Third on the top is humor. Most people like to laugh. Careful though. There are gender and personal exceptions. Some people just don't appreciate humor in general. Don't talk to them. They're assholes. Also guys are more playful than girls. I'm generalizing here but there is noticeable difference in how both genders perceive humor. Look at female comedians and you'll find their form of humor is somewhat different, relies more on long narrative. The topic of discussion overlap a lot with male comedians but delivery is different. Even the crudest female comedian (Lisa Lampanelli-mild though annoying shock comedy) doesn't come anywhere close to the crudest male comedians (Doug Stanhope (midget fucking, squeezing bananas out of vaginas into someone's mouth)). Don't get too worried. But DO recognize that difference. It's not a firm one but it's important enough to be considered.
 
Now you don't need prepare specific one-liners for conversations. In fact any signs of pre-preparation can kill the mood. People are most receptive to spontaneous humor in regular conversation. People who have been around each other for a long time develop what seems to be an encyclopedia of inside jokes, which again is why it can hard for you to join a long formed group. People like a healthy combination of spontaneity and repetition. Bringing someone new in creates the dangerous risk of trying to explain an inside joke and finally revealing how retarded it is. Not good! But nevertheless, fooling around is common among both girls and boys. Privately, both genders can get as dirty as dirty can get in their humor, but they just do it differently. You'll find some shit that made your male friends laugh their asses off, flying right over a girl's head. Vice versa too. But it's not a big deal. You'll notice I'm beating around the bush on this one; I stand by my thesis, but I cannot explain clearly why


You'll find a fair share of guys who are perverts. They'll throw sexual one-liners when some remotely cute girl comes within the vicinity. Don't assume these are all virgins. You'd be amazed how their personality u-turns when they have a chance of getting laid. You know when rain just suddenly stops falling and it's sunny again. That's how dramatic the change is. Now you have to be careful with these guys, they're borderline sociopaths. They'll tell you fucked up shit they've done in a casual fashion. 

The less intelligent the guy, the greater chance of excessive emotional attachment to vehicles (they'll never own) and sports team. If you don't  know anything about sports or cars, you're in trouble. 

Girls... hmm.. they talk about everything. You just need to find the girl who vibrates on your level. I personally prefer girls who are off in terms being a girl. Genderless but female in sex. Remember, the less intelligent the girl, the probability of the newest cellphone being mentioned increases. There is literally nothing going on these girl's heads. NOTHING. How they raise children is a mystery. You should shed any preconceptions you have about women. They can be as nasty or as kind as their parents raised them to be.

Don't expect intellectual conversations to pop up too often. Even among so-called readers. You'll hear some popular names dropped like Foucault, Lacan, Kafka, Zizek, some German dudes, the Jewish lesbian lady who believes in gender construction, etc., But if you hang around liberal arts types, expect some superficial conversations on society, capitalism, politics etc., These conversations always have the same premises and conclusions. Liberal vs. Conservative. Bush sucks. Postmodernism for the win. You'll all agree that you're angry with how society is run and you'll all get drunk and repeat this weekend. [Class sucks, Fuck society, Fuck everything, let's get drunk]. When you graduate. Replace class with work. When you're retired. Replace work with [wife or anyone who bothers you (kids on the lawn etc.,)] Expect plenty of gross generalizations, oversimplifications and exaggerations. Never EVER be ambiguous and express any signs of clear thinking in these discussions. These discussions are a manifestation of groupthink and are necessary affirmations that strengthen bonds among the members of a group. Think of them as the replacement of the Prayer of the Lord. They're basically a ritual.

Every group of friends keeps a clown, a jester. Be careful not to end up in this spot. You are there to provide humor, not in a dignified comedic way but in a self-deprecating-potential for Virginia-Tech-kind of way. You could have a GPA of 4.0 but you are not immune. This is a fulltime job. Expect the stupid shit you do to be talked about by your ""friends"" EVERY day. Now I've never been a jester but I've been curious about the psychology of the jester. They can be very intelligent but it seems to escape them why they're the dumbass of the group. Even large groups of people, for example, a class of 25-50, typically have some village idiot roaming around. This idiot raises his/her hand constantly and the retarded questions provide endless humor. The problem with being a jester is once you've firmly assumed the role, ANYTHING you say or do is now stupid and fucking funny. You could give a coherent intelligent talk on the downfall of the Umayyad Caliphate and it would be fucking funny all the way through.

Sex as an act doesn't come up as often as you think, even though movies portray it as such. Things of sexual nature come up often but something in the line of those ""lay reports"" those demented seduction people post all over the internet don't really come up. 

Drugs like alcohol are necessary to kill the mundane nature of everything. You'll find even the most intelligent people do drink, smoke, or take drugs. I don't drink, but my recommendations is you'll need to drink if you're hanging out with people who are drinking. You'll need to smoke if you hang around smokers. You'll need to do drugs if you hang around druggies. Being the oddman out puts everyone on guard and the quality of conversation declines. Drugs make childish things acceptable. They make substandard jokes, monologues, and dances highly prized. If you have any dumb jokes that just wouldn't cut it when everyone is sober, save them for the weekend binge.


Summary: The more you have in common the better. Don't try to explain a ""that's what she said"" to someone from overseas. Guys hang out with guys. Girls with girls. It's not a sexism thing. It's just that your girlfriend is going to bash your head in if she finds out most of your friends have vaginas. Vice versa for girls. Not sure how it works for homosexuals. I have never talked to an openly gay person.

The more educated the person, the more cultural references are made. You will not get them if you're not at the same level or are from overseas.

"Oh, I have to go get my dream journal. By the way, I recommend keeping one of these. Looking back on past dreams is extremely interesting. I wish I wrote them down everyday, but I'm usually too lazy. These ones, however, aren't so much ""totally awesome"" as weird/surreal. 

* Vivid dream in which I seemed to belong to an old man's harem. Hundred of young women were in the harem. We lived in a hilly green valley with tall trees scattered about. We were constantly trying to run away, and at the same time trying to stay where we were. One girl had died and been buried under rocks in a ravine. One day while running with some others I tripped over the rocks and revealed her face, pristinely preserved. Two of us stared in shock and fear, but a third girl crouched down and touched a flower resting upon the corpse's collarbone. ""The flower preserves her,"" she said. 
* Ridiculously long spiel about a haunted house and not wanting to be scared, begging the haunted house actors to leave me alone, and then: Next thing I was on a date with the businessman in a fancy restaurant, and though I knew nothing about him other than that he owned the haunted house (didn't even know his name), I loved him utterly. Vice President Cheney was at the table next to ours, celebrating his birthday. A black woman hugged him and he said something offensive.
* Dream that I was in a playground talking to my mother. But my mother was young, only in her 30s. The playground was very dark. The sky was completely overcast and felt like the time of day right before the sun rises, when everything is kind of blue. A child cried and I picked her up. My mother smiled as she looked at us, and I realized (or perhaps always knew) that the wailing two-year-old was me.
* (June 5th, 2008) Vivid dream scene where I was in a large atrium in a crumbling penthouse. Everything was covered in vines. My grandfather was there standing opposite me, only he looked nothing like my grandfather. He was telling me that Barack Obama shouldn't win the election because he's ""nothing but victory in image."" My grandfather said Hillary Clinton lost the primary because of sexism. He appeared very jaded. I wanted to disagree with him, but I could not speak.

I also once had a lucid dream that involved dinosaurs chasing humans down. Everyone was running around all frantic and I was just like, ""This is weird."" Also, Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer kept yelling at me about not running.",4
"Obviously, discussions tend to become hostile depending on the fraction of people arguing that actually are mature, civil, literate, and have open minds. If I post an unpopular opinion, it's likely to be downvoted/chastised less quickly on subreddits than on the main page. As an example, see the difference in the depth of discussion on youtube videos of a popular topic (e.g., Obama's town hall meeting) and on a topic that's of limited interest (such as a physics video). 

I've also noticed that cultural differences tend to influence someone's ""default"" stance against disagreement. I'm Indian, and in web forums that are predominantly Indian, we have very few people who retort to comments/posts they disagree with using an insult. However, it seems to be common practice in mostly-US forums to reply to such comments with ""Your wrong"" or ""Your retarded"" (present company excluded, of course!). More interestingly, at the first hint of an insult, opposing parties seem bent on escalating the debate to a full-blown flame war. I have a number of theories for this: 
 
 * We (Indians) take pride in our country, but we have never colonized other countries or been superpowers. Our politicians (the literate ones, at least) do not preface speeches with ""We are the greatest nation in the world"". Perhaps people that toss around insults freely feel that their country's prowess negates any need for humility or modesty. 
 * People who grew up in the real world carry real-world manners back to online discussions, but people who grew up with bad grammar and name-calling on IRC chatrooms and web forums stay that way. Many of my American friends who are the same age as me started using forums in their early teens; I started when I was 19. So it's quite likely that kids in India these days are just as bad mannered (and have worse grammar) than kids here.",2

"This is not how categorization works. People do not group objects, concepts or ideas into strict groups (there are a few exceptions to this, eg; the group 'Triangles' is very strictly defined, but this is an exception, not a rule), rather they create broad groups of *similar* objects. For an object (or idea or concept etc) to be included in the group, it is not necessary that it meet all of the criteria exactly, but rather that it shares similarities with other members of that group. Objects can belong to more than one group, and it is not always obvious what the boundaries of a group are. This is very apparent when discussing the categorizing of people into 'races'. It will often be unclear exactly what defines the members of a 'race' and the boundaries of the group will be unclear. 'Typical' attributes may describe the members of more than one race. And a person may possess attributes of more than one race, and yet clearly belong to a racial group, or a person may fit into more than one racial group, depending on the viewpoint of an observer. 

So for example the category 'Black', may contain the some of the following *possible* attributes (all of which are very subjective, and depend on the observers experience of 'normal', for this example the observer would be a white American):

* Dark skin
* Dark, curly hair
* 'African' features (eg: large lips)
* A higher than average chance of sickle-cell anemia
* Higher than average sporting ability
* Etc...

Of course to a person from sub-Saharan Africa, a person who fit those attributes from the point of view of a white American (eg Obama) may seem to be closer to the category of 'White'.

So the linguistic use of the idea of race really fits quite well into the cognitive framework with which people describe the world based on their observations. We here all know that the genetic basis of race is tenuous at best (more likely completely irrelevant).It is not the linguistic idea of race that is wrong (indeed it would probably be impossible to change this), but rather the way that those ideas are (lazily and unscientifically) applied to people and used to form snap judgments about their character. In this area I think that society is clearly making rapid advancement towards a fairer, more careful way of thinking. It is important to be vigilant against racism, but it is also wise to occasionally stop and take a moment to appreciate just how far we have come (we have a black President!). I don't think that this progress was made by denying the nature of peoples mind by forcing them to think of others without the concept of race. I think it is rather due to people becoming more aware and careful of how their attitudes can negatively affect others.",2
"Obama doesn't just get to impose his will on the rest of America. Presidents only have veto power.

"""So no offense intended"" but I think the argument that stupidity is limited to a small portion of the American public is wishful thinking - and that American members of an online community that considers itself intellecutal and progressive are far from immune to stupid - at least by European standards.

I honestly believe some Americans have watched ""V for Vendetta"" and read a load of scaremongering news articles on the subject and believe that is reality! Especially when I read comments like ""you're living in a police state"", ""surveilance cameras everywhere"", ""tracked by the government at every step"". What makes this totally unforgiveable from a redditor perspective is, generally speaking, I witness many looney US reports being torn apart/laughed at (and rightly so) when they scaremonger US progressive affairs and reform, but obviously the same people swallow up complete and total shit when it comes to looney US reports on foreign countries such as the UK. Unfortunately, because the US Conservative right is so insane, it's forced the US left to swing out wildy to counterbalance them so you aren't going to get much help there either.

Also don't read centre-right UK tabloids (e.g. Daily Mail/Daily Express/etc) and give them any importance. They are just as stupid as US news for impartial reporting. If you do read them and base your ideas of the UK on them, please start agreeing with everything Glenn Beck is saying about Obama and health care reform - because you are committing the same intellectual crime.

I'm not saying it's perfect in the UK - don't get me wrong, this current Labour administration has attempted to, and in some cases managed to, pass some laws that don't make me particularly happy. But nothing much more virulent than the ""Patriot Act"" has been enacted, so don't worry too much for us - and start wondering why you aren't just as worried for your own nation.
 
Anyway, when it comes to the crazy ideas many redditors have about the UK life because we are apparently living in an Orwellian nightmare - the phrase ""wake up sheeple"" comes to mind. Your media wants to make you think you have it better than every other country, and that your country is the best (as usual) - and spurts out exaggerated bullshit to keep you feeling warm and fuzzy that you live in the ""land of the free"". Did you believe O'Reilly's rants about Amsterdam being a pit of vice and evil too?

"I'm not exactly House, but I really don't like a lot of people in the world. I was doing pretty well today though. I got up early, taking the time to have a good breakfast, and watch some local weather and traffic reports. I packed my lunch, and my gym bag before heading out the door. I even said hello the newspaper woman, and held the door for my neighbor. I was having a nice, stress-free drive to work (getting up early also comes with the benefit of less traffic). 

I said to myself, ""Gee, wildeink, you're starting the day off pretty well! I'm going to be really productive today. Maybe you'll even ask out the good looking intern at the gym!"". I felt great; did I mention that? I actually said hello to my coworker, already on cup #7 of his morning coffee, on his way to pick up one of the 50+ emails he prints out daily. Cheerful, I say, ""I'll put on the radio! Maybe I'll get lucky and hear something new"". I flipped the switch, and put on my headphones. ""Lady Gaga? No thanks."" I changed the dial.

And it's communities who ***can't afford*** a full-time fire staff use volunteer staffs. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a community that wouldn't like to have enough funds to pay for a staffed fire department. 

And that's sorta my point too, a government program doesn't have to be at the federal level, or even the state level. I think government backed health insurance should be at the federal level, but there's no reason it can't be done state by state except for the fact that state's don't have as much money and have less leverage in making more than the federal government.

Also, Obama and the Democrats aren't even talking about government run health care, or mandatory government health insurance, they just want an ***option*** to buy health insurance from the government. It's still gonna be an premium based services, he's not even talking Euro-style tax funded health services, just the ***insurance*** part.

As it stands a small number of arms manufacturers will benefit from these wars and of course the funeral parlours in Iraq and the US will also see a bit of a boom time as a result, but for you, me and the man on the street it means less money for public services, a higher future tax burden for us and any kids we have and definitley not saving the world economy.",1

Is it fraud that he asked to be laid off?  Tricky question, but if he has a termination letter stating that he has been let go through no fault of his own, then he is probably eligible for unemployment benefits.

However, if you can prove that he is not meeting the requirements for unemployment, then you could bust him.  Most states will require you to be actively searching for work, so if you could prove that he has no intention of looking for work, then you might be able to get him.

Call in to report him and see what happens.",3
"I understand what you mean and I sympathise. It's just that as I understand it Obama is faced with a rabid opposition who are denouncing him as the great Satan at every turn. Obama's proposals on health care are the bare minimum for what a civilised country should have, and look how the right reacts. He's labeled a communist, wild rumors are spread, and people in the red states talk about secession. Utter hysteria. 


Now can you imagine what their reaction would be if say, he took even the slightest step towards legalising cannabis? I am all for it, but it seems clear it would be the end of his political career. Even if he took the rational and modest steps you suggest, imagine the take Fox news would have. ""Obama putting doobies in your baby's mouth!"" And a significant portion of Americans would believe it. 



As I see it, the problem is that as a black president, Obama has to be very careful with how he spends his political capital. For his first term he seems to have decided to put his all into health care, and even that might not be enough. I think he's being politically savvy by neglecting things like ""Don't ask don't tell"" etc, and focusing on getting one thing done at a  time. That isn't to say gay rights are not important, but I think he identifies health care as a more critical issue. This pragmatism combined with compassion is I believe what makes Obama a great president. 


You say being a president is about multitasking. In my opinion, it's about prioritizing. He has to make the decision to neglect some areas in order to save others. Every issue he on which spends his political capital means that another issue goes without. If he tries to take on everything piecemeal, I believe he would get torn to pieces. Even the small steps you suggest would be opposed by lobbying groups and blown out of proportion by the media that caters to people already frightened of a black man in the White House.",3

Also, the bill explicitly states that illegals are NOT to be covered, even if there is no enforcement.  The reality is more nuanced than ""Obama was misleading"", and certainly does not allow for an unsubstantiated ""You lie!"" comment.  Furthermore, when Medicare had enforcement against illegals, it led to more problems for those who qualified but did not have their paperwork in order, and affected very few illegals, who are proportionately few in number.  The reason for no enforcement is mainly because no option for enforcement is easy to execute, and may hamper critical and necessary care.

The British House of Parliament, for example, rails hard and often against their Prime Minister, but accusations akin to ""You lie!"" are explicitly *not* allowed.",4

He promised that every non-emergency bill brought to him to sign would be available for public review and comment for five days prior to signing. Every bill signed so far has been done so immediately.

He promised no lobbyists in the White House. I'm guessing the more than a dozen former lobbyists don't count as their new jobs prevent them from continuing their old lobbyist ones?

Obama criticized Bush for his use of signing statements attached by the president to signed bills to instruct as to how the laws ought to be carried out. To paraphrase Obama: No president has this authority. Yeah, you guessed it, he's doing it too.

Of course, there's the ubiquitous no new taxes pledge as well. He signed a $.62 per pack tax increase on cigarettes. I don't smoke, but still, it IS a new tax...

Fun story: at the time I worked for an environmental non-profit, and since we are a non-profit, there are very strict rules about talking about politics in the office.

The policy adopted by the Obama administration is basically the opposite of that adopted by the Bush administration.

See comment by [stone11](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9scui/how_the_fuck_do_you_win_the_nobel_peace_prize_for/c0e82iu) concerning the rest of your points.  It is up to debate as to whether or not a decision by the Obama adminstration to withdraw from all forms of military participation in that area of the Middle East would lead to a) sudden order and acceptance of a legitimate United States attempt at sustainable peace there or b) cause widespread sectarian violence and a regrowth of terrorist activity.  b) seems more likely.

Additionally, I might add that the Obama adminstration inherited this.  When did Bush put a time line on Iraq withdrawal that was within his presidency?  Secretary of Defense Gates has actually scolded extravagant and unnecessary spending by the Pentagon and DoD, though admittedly has not lowered the budget.  

If you were handed a silver platter with a time bomb on it, would you immediately throw the bomb away from yourself, regardless of its effects elsewhere, or would you take a rational approach and attempt to sort out which wires defused it? (yes, it is a silly analogy)

Don't get me wrong, let my opinion be known- I am skeptical of most bureaucratic organizations, especially the federal government, and certainly don't approve of many of the things Obama has *not changed* (Patriot Act extensions, ""state secrets"" privleges, Afghan war, you had mentioned)- but note he hasn't instituted many regrettable policies of his own.  I just think it a bit unfair to claim that Obama is simply ""not Bush"" (or the administration-equivalent).  We are orders of magnitude better off with our current administration, but we are obviously not perfect.  I just think they have a more sustainable approach to the geopolitical scene.

"Its actually more interesting from a foreign policy perspective than it is a domestic. At the moment everyone is focused on the economy and health care, and the missile defense stuff doesn't need congressional approval so it was easy to slip though domestically. Even still it probably upset the republicans (who are arguing themselves into irrelevancy, since everyone knows they have no interest in supporting anything the president does) and possibly some of the blue dogs (although I haven't heard much from them, to be honest).

The real fun is in the whole Europe/Russia area. Central Europe doesn't think Western Europe can/will protect them against Russia so they want a deal with America that puts troops and equipment in their countries. Russia is becoming more authoritarian and assertive in the region, which aggravates the situation. Western Europe just wants to sell shit and get oil, so they're hoping the US would take care of the issue and thus are not pleased about us pulling out. Once Obama made the call, Russia was immediately declaring victory. Eastern Europe is not exactly happy, and reactions from Western Europe were mixed.


Missile defense is an interesting subject because it has nothing to do with missile defense. There was this great interview on PBS awhile ago with some general (I'm sorry I can't be more specific) about why people (Russia in particular) are upset.

Its been over 60 years since we've had a world war, and while people may through around a lot of reasons the biggest is that the next world war is going to be the last. MAD has kept the cold war from boiling over simply because both sides new direct action would be suicide. At the same time missile defense is only possible against a limited amount of missiles, one of the reasons both the US and Russia have an insane amount of weapons. Missile defense is only really reliable against those limited numbers (which is why we're saying its for protection from Iran), so if you think there is a threat you need to take out as many missiles as you can first.

For these reasons the ""defense"" aspect is kind of a misnomer. By eliminating MAD we get the ability to wage war on a global scale again, and more importantly (at least as far as Russia is concerned) this raises the viability of the US launching, and surviving, a first strike. Thats what missile defense ultimately boils down to- a first strike weapon. Its for these reasons there was worry about an arms race- if we get missile defense, then Russia will want to as well, not to mention both countries working to overcome their counterparts defenses.

"&gt;It is one thing to agree that things need to change. It is quite another actually have some kind of plan and try to move towards a goal. What did conservatives do for healthcare when THEY had an overwhelming majority? Nothing. 

&gt;Obama may have disappointed me on several fronts in terms of his promises of change, but so far healthcare is not one of them. We are seeing the most ambitious movement for change that we've seen out of this government in a long time.

Herein lies the problem: people assume that since the current system is broken, we need change, and therefore 'change = good'. What people don't realize is that the new system will only be as good as what it is changed to, which is in this case, arguably even worse than the current system. People just don't realize it because of the back and forth propaganda from both sides that has obfuscated most of the core problems.

&gt;I don't think liberals believe that public healthcare is flawless. It does, however, solve a lot of problems that simply cannot be addressed by a free market alone. How can you argue against that? By making up stories of ""death panels?"" Of forced euthanasia for the elderly? Telling people that Obama will kill their grandma?

Really? You don't think that the liberals represented on sites like this one think public healthcare is flawless? Have you not read the comment response on places like digg and reddit to those horrible anecdotal arguments for healthcare like 'LOL IM A HIGHSCHOOL DROPUT WHO JUST WANTED TO CHILL YO BUT THE GOVERNMENT IN AMERICA WOULD BE ALL IN MY SHIT FO PAYIN INSURANCE BILLZ FO MY DIABETES+OBESITY+ENSUING HEART PROBLEMS FROM EATIN GOOD N SHIT BUT LUCKILY IM IN DA UK AND IMA GET MY SHIT FIXED **FO FREE**"" and then the liberal circlejerk responses like 'OMG CONSERVATIVES ARE EVIL PEOPLE THAT SIT AROUND A TABLE AND PLAN EVIL SHIT THEY TRYIN 2 GET US KILLED SO THEY CAN B RICH AND STEAL ALL THE GOOD INSURANCES SO THEY BLOCK THIS WONDERFUL HEALTHCARE!!11""

For every problem public healthcare 'solves', it creates even greater ones. Healthcare now is like having a cut artery in need of repair and public healthcare is like putting a big, expensive, fancy-looking but ultimately useless and bacteria-infested band-aid over it that people think looks good, but aren't aware does nothing to fix the cut. 

Focusing on counter-arguments with the dumb stuff that a few of the equally idiotic and misguided conservatives have been spewing (i.e. Palin's death panel nonsense) causes the kind of bullshit politics I mentioned earlier that cause people to get caught up in nit-picking retarded points and just addressing those in an attempt to make each other look stupid rather than looking at the issue objectively and the benefits vs. flaws of each sides of the argument. 

Look, I hate to break it to you guys, but this is not some 'good vs evil one side is completely right and the other side is completely demonic' debate here. If the solution was as simple and effective as the gung-ho liberals were trying to make it out to be, nobody would be trying to stand in its way, even if you think politicians invest 100% of their time in making the other side 'look bad'. If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. That applies just as much to what you've been hearing about public healthcare.

Henry Kissinger won it in 1973 - this after conducting a massive bombing campaign in Cambodia that led to civil war and genocide, as well as playing a central role in Operation Condor, a campaign of assassination in South America.

Nelson Mandela won in 1993, after conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare in which many civilians became casualties. 

Yasser Arafat, who won in 1994, was the leader of the PLO, which was also well-known for attacks on civilians in the name of their cause, and was regarded by most of the Western world as a terrorist.

.

The Nobel Peace Prize isn't intended for those who have never committed acts of war or contributed to any form of violence in any way. The intended recipient of the award, as declared by Alfred Nobel, is to be awarded to the person who:

&gt;""during the preceding year [...] shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.

Now, as frustrated as you may be about Obama's decisions (increasing troops in Afghanistan), and failure to act as swiftly and decisively to rectify the problems caused by Bush (and in fact on occasion being in the awkward position of defending the actions of the Bush Administration), it's foolish to ignore the strides he *has* made towards world unity and peace.

Firstly, he has outlined a plan to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq, a withdrawal that has already started (albeit undoubtedly not nearly as quickly as many liberals would like). He has spent a great deal of time and effort engaging other nations of the world, as well as his unprecedented gesture of addressing the Muslim world, extending an open hand to longtime enemies like Iran (albeit while still warning them that this is not to be taken as weakness or a sign of tolerance towards human rights violations and violations of international treaties). He has worked towards nuclear nonproliferation, eased tensions with Russia, and extended diplomatic overtures towards North Korea. He has been vocal in his opposition to Israel's recent actions in the Gaza strip, and has been a leading figure in the effort to resolve a recession that has extended throughout much of the world.

Many people throughout the world have seen his willingness to open discussions with leaders around the world as a refreshing and stark contrast to Bush, and feel that his diplomatic ties with other nations have strengthened international relations immensely. Obama has not just abandoned the unilateralism and domineering approach to international relations Bush had, but has actively engaged other world leaders, and gone out of the way to show them due respect, much to the chagrin of his political opposition in America who balks every time Obama bows to a world leader, not to mention those times when he concedes to the requests of other nations (such as when Obama announced plans to scrap plans for a missile defense site in Poland, much to the relief of Russian leaders).

Yes, Obama's hands aren't perfectly clean, but in today's world it's virtually impossible to accomplish something like that. If Obama decided to rip every last American soldier out of the Middle East, the results would likely be catastrophic - chaos would ensue in the region, and most likely far more lives would be lost. Those are not the actions of a bastion of peace, but of a coward whose distaste for war has blinded him to the high cost of abandoning it.

Were there others more deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize? Maybe. But overall I don't think that Obama is a poor choice, regardless of his decisions regarding Afghanistan. He has indeed done quite a lot in his short time in office to strengthen international relations, and despite his shortcomings has become a beacon of hope for the rest of the world, making him a symbolically strong choice, even if the man doesn't quite live up to this public perception.",4

The previous year, this particular program received over 500 applicants and accepted 30 students.  (My applying year they had even more applicants than the previous)
It's competitive.  It's competitive because people are realizing the value of it...PA's can do 90% of what MD's can do.  Hell, my boss who's 35 and extremely successful, agreed with me that PA was a better route these days than MD.  There's no malpractice insurance.  They diagnose, treat, write scripts, assist in surgeries...almost everything.  They do need to work under a ""supervising physician,"" but can be either on site or not.  On average, fresh out of high school you can be a PA in 6 years, however some extremely intense programs push it into 5 years; much less than Pre-Med, Med School, and a residency.
Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant are essentially the same thing; the real difference is that Nurse Practitioners need to be a Registered Nurse first, and can practice without a physician-but most work with doctors anyways.
Median salary is $85,000 or so, work regular hours, no need to be on call, again-no paying malpractice insurance...not bad for 5 or 6 yrs of school.
And hey-the way Obama healthcare is looking, doctors won't be making all that much more in the near future anyways!",1
"I'm sorry, but that's wrong.

Ad Hominem ""is an argument which links the validity of a premise to an irrelevant characteristic or belief of the person advocating the premise.""

Straw Man ""is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to ""win"" an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic.""

In his argument, Johnnycourage is clearly attacking the character of the opponent by making statements like:

&gt; You don't seem like the king of person that digests scientific evidence well.



&gt; your imaginary friend



&gt; ... interrupt the Toby Keith concert or hold you up at WalMart?

He is clearly trying to illicit a negative response by drawing on our stereotypes. At no point, however, does he change the subject. There would be no need to make a straw man argument in this situation, because barley's point is so easily refutable to begin with. For the sake of argument though, a straw man would look like, ""Yeah? And I bet you're against Obama being elected as well.""

There needs to be a clear shift in subject, otherwise the argument isn't a straw man.",1

"Don't think it would work properly, especially with the current two-party system.

For instance: Obama and McCain made very different promises, and had substantially different ideas about how to run the country.  The majority voted for Obama and HIS platform.  If he were to die, McCain would run the country based on his platform, which is the will of the minority, not the majority (who elected Obama).

That's not to say I'd be psyched about Biden being president.  But I think that he'd at least keep the country moving in the direction Obama has pointed it, not turn the ship around like McCain would.

I like the idea of having a presidential election, then a separate runoff election for VP.  The runoff election could be between the Republican candidate, and the most prominent Democratic primary runner-up.",1

"From the post ww1 era on through the cold war era (and afterwards) the american public was told of a great red communist menace, threatening the United States. You likely remember this better than I. We had to be afraid and oppose the evil communists or else all would be lost. In the midst of all this, the term socialist got all wrapped up with the term communist. It became a common assumption that communism and socialism were antithetical to america and all the awesomeness we supposedly stand for.

A couple of years ago, I was telling some of my college friends that I was a democratic socialist and one girl, a liberal and a leftist (she later worked on the Obama campaign), asked me ""aren't those two [democracy and socialism], you know, like opposites."" Somewhere along the line this poor girl had been indoctrinated, likely unintentionally, that socialism was really very horrible and that it is incompatible with democracy.

Bailing out the banks when they were about to go under (something I was not happy about at all) is different from socialism.

Supporting labor unions is different from socialism.

Welfare is different from socialism.

Expanding administrations is different from socialism.

If Obama were a socialist and an anti-capitalist, he would be actively moving towards such a system. He would be adamant about buying out all of the health insurance companies, then making healthcare a 100% state run system. He would actually be buying up companies instead of just giving them loans (like an idiot, I hate that he's doing this) and trusting corporate executives, something conservatives seem to be all about, right?

"Hey one important thing. When I said you were angry and said something happened, well that was insulting and came out the wrong way. As soon as I wrote that I knew I was going to look like an ass. I truly apologize for that. I don't know you at all and it was stupid. What I meant to say was that we can't filter logic and facts through the prism of our own experiences.  I don't want to be that guy that comes here and spews personal attacks, and I came a little to close for comfort, bad on me all the way around.

Now to the rebuttal.  On point 1 you actually made my point. Population did not increase dramatically in the 1980s, but GDP did.  This is only possible because of real job/productivity growth.  

You are dead right on credit for ups and downs. And assuming a defensive posture on attacks on Reagan probably skewed my rhetoric. But, without a leader espousing free market growth, it would not have happened. In other words, even though Blue Dog Democrats and fiscally conservative free-market Republicans pushed the agenda in Congress, Reagan led the charge. Carter would not have done so.  

The single most important aspect of the Reagan administration was monetary policy.  Now lately Volcker gets all of the credit for this, and he should get the lion's share.  But it was Ronald Reagan who point blank asked Volcker why we needed a Fed in the first place. I believe it was also Reagan who ""encouraged"" Volcker to raise interest rates and slow inflation at any cost.  We can argue til the cows come home about fiscal policy. The truth is that many nations with irresponsible fiscal policies survive and turn things around. For monetary policy this is not the case. Nations that pursuit inflation to pay down debt, do not survive. You will find no examples of this in recorded history, it doesn't work and it leads to abject poverty for many, and a loss of living standard for all in the nation.  Debt monetization is a nation killer without fail.  It killed the Spanish Empire and their currency was actually silver. It killed Weimar Germany and precipitated the rise of the fascists throughout Europe, and Gideon Gono has surely killed Zimbabwe in the last few years. Were Mugabe not a brutal tyrant with guns, he would be dead or deposed.

If you're honest about your position on Obama's deficit spending, then  your consistency and character are not in doubt. But how does he continue to push big expensive government programs?  You cannot be for both. At some point we run out of rich people to tax, and at some point I think everyone agrees there is a Laffer curve. Surely you cannot tax the wealthy at 95% and expect investment in innovative technologies to continue.

"3 months: US economy is beginning to recover; most shit is pretty much the same. Situation in pakistan and mexico both get worse. for myself, I will be going back to school and hating that.

Housing market is still down. Campaign for the 2010 fall elections is fierce. Personally, will be moving to Hong Kong for a summer internship

5 years: 2014, Obama is still president, having won re-election. International relations-wise, shit is going down in the middle east, again, because oil prices have been falling (from alternative energy and more fuel efficient vehicles) and supplies have been running low. US has been giving lots of aid to a lot of places. US economy is back in full swing and growing strong. Personally, will be 2 years into my job and living in Geneva, getting married soon

10 years: democrat is still in office, having gotten the post-successful presidency bump. Iraq and Afghanistan are finally free of US troops. Israel has agreed to a two state solution, but not what the palestineans had hoped for; relations between the two are tense.

"Regarding the recent history, quickly, the Clintons tried to pass a form of single-payer health reform in the '90s.  This bill was written within the Clinton Administration and completely failed, it might not have even gotten out of committee (I was only 8).  The important distinction is that the Obama Administration has insisted upon Congress to make the bill.  Possible to encourage ""bipartisanship"", but more likely to avoid the embarrassment the Clintons went through when their bill was a piece of crap (which this bill also is turning out to be).


  The reason why this debate has been going on forever, is because of the way in which Congress writes and debates legislation.  Bills originate in Committees, which are issue specific and composed of members of both parties.  

  For this bill, three committees in the House produced their own health care bills, and two committees in the Senate produced their own separate bills (the Senate Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions Committee and the Senate Financial &amp; Something I Don't Remember Committee).  

  Then the House merged its 3 bills into one bill, which passed.  The Senate is in the process of merging its 2 bills.  If the Senate bill passes, Health Reform enters its Final Stage: where the House either passes the Senate bill as it is, or it attempts to merge these final bills into one bill.  
THEN that bill needs to pass the House and Senate, and bypassing Filibusters (60 votes).  

And finally President Obama can sign it.

The assassination issue brought up by Pernius is one of the original reasons why there was a change in the first place.

The rednecks who claimed that Obama is a Muslim did so because they never really met a Muslim. If they knew Muslims they wouldn't be afraid of them. You can't blame someone for not knowing better.

"&gt; I was speaking in the collective ""you"", which, whenever confronted with the vitriol of the atheism subreddit, act as though the majority of posts that are outright attacks on people who think differently don't exist, such as this.

Am I not part of the collective you? You say I'm one of the most level-headed, but you make statements that pretend I don't exist either.

The post you cite is indeed vacuous and trollish. I'll point out that it only ever got to 97 points, 123 people voted against it, and there are several highly rated comments criticizing it.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/76vv3/if_idiot_conservatives_will_argue_that_obamaosama/) equally vacuous post got modded up to 2324 because it criticized Palin and conservatives instead of Christians. It's even a red-numbered post, meaning it hit #1 across all of reddit.

Edit: On Dawkins and Hitchens: I won't defend Hitchens. He's got a bit of a trollish streak in him, no doubt. Dawkins, however, is usually rather polite. Dawkins does not believe that religion is the root of all evil. BBC4 gave his documentary the title ""Root of All Evil?"" (with the Fox News question mark) to drum up controversy despite his wishes. Instead he says the idea that anything is the root of all evil is ridiculous.

"It's not so much recurring as it's happened more than once:

""She's out of town, c'mon.""

"The most important thing to remember about posture is that advice which is good for a certain body type, is going to be bad for another body type.

""Sitting up straight"" - is good advice if you have a lot of meat on you, and your abdomen can support the weight of your torso. It's very bad advice if you're skinny, because it really stresses your vertebrae. A back which is curved out distributes the force of the weight of the head and the torso a lot better - whereas, if you're skinny, and you ""sit up straight"" - all that force will fall on those four or five vertebrae in the arch of your lower back. Slouching or putting your feet up (think about how Barack Obama sometimes sits [at his desk][obama]) is really good for a skinny person's posture while sitting. Remember that good posture, even when seated is dynamic, not static. You should always be shifting your weight around, adopting different ways of sitting, so as to relieve the pressure on certain bones or the stress on certain muscles. Of course, shifting your posture, and even rubbing parts of your body sometimes, also helps the lymph to flow in your body - which promotes good health overall.

When walking or doing daily tasks, some general advice would be to push your chest out. Think about walking with your legs attached directly to your chest... and manipulating objects with your hands with your chest muscles being active. It may feel funny at first, but it changes the way forces are transferred between muscles and skeletal structure in a way that's really efficient. In addition to this, for skinny people it would be important to do what feels like bending the lower back out a bit (which will actually be just removing the arch in it).

As far as arm placement goes... having arms just at the sides is actually quite natural looking. That's one of the things that choristers in choirs have to be reminded of by their director sometimes. Standing in front of an audience with arms loose at the sides can feel awkward when it really isn't.

As to your question about using good posture when you're not thinking about it - mostly it has to do with just getting into the rhythm of doing it. Another part of good posture is how you express yourself with your face... managing your composure is something that was taught to women in finishing schools in the early 1900s. Another  important thing to think about is what patterns your eyes take when they scan around you. Beauty is really not in the structure of the body or face; it's rather how you hold these things - and how your attitudes about life show through with your body language. I find when practicing this kind of facade, it's important to do it even when home alone. If you ""let your hair down"" when alone... the habits just don't take root.

Finally, it's a good thing to think deeply about Newton's laws of physics. The body is like a spring. And as you stand or sit, the ground/chair is pushing on your body, as much as your body is pushing on it. The forces always are matched in two opposite directions.

My mate was not amused and said ""If she likes dubya, you like dubya, at least until the morning."" He had a point.

Next time in fact was almost the exact same circumstances with a Girl from Texas. She was visiting Dublin last year (summer 08) and started talking about how I should like McCain because he has an ""Irish second name"" (even though, if anything, it's biggest connection to Ireland would be Scotland, so at most, ulster scot) - but that bizarre statement aside, it was the statement ""Obama has too much of a muslim connection"" that pissed me off. She instantly became unattractive not because she believed that Obama was either a secret Muslim or had too many connections (his father) to Islam that she didn't like. She became instantly unattractive because if any of that, even if it was true - should not make any fucking difference. It's one thing I can not wrap my head around about North American conservative rhetoric. If someone was to say they are not going to vote someone because they are a Jew there would be uproar.

"This is going to sound crazy but whatever.  So in 2008 I was working as a congressional intern on capitol hill.  Id been there a few weeks and one day after work I realized I had forgotten my id card in the office.  So I talked the capitol police officers into letting me run back to the office and snag it.  So Im walking through the halls of the Rayburn building and its like 1030 or so and the lights are dim and the place has a real creepy vibe.  Every now and then Id see someone out of the corner of my eye and itd be janitorial staff or what have you.  So Im walking down the hall (halls in the RHB are super long, almost a city block) and I see a light on from under the door in the Armed Services committee room.  I dont think anything of it and and keep walking and out of nowhere...a gunshot.

So I whirl around and Im sure the shot came from the committee room.  I start to panic a little bit and I hear shouting coming from the room.  I know I should I run but I dont.  I snuck over to the door and put my ear to it, hoping I could hear whats going on.  There was a guy crying, sounding like he was begging someone else not to kill him.  I didnt know what to do so I just stood there and listened and heard what the guy said.

""We told you what would happen if you talked to a reporter. As far the world is concerned, its true.  He was born in America.""

The crying guy said something I couldnt hear and then there were two more gunshots.  ""That was for Obama!"" the other voice yelled.  ""And for Mother Kenya!""  There were a bunch more shots and I took off.  This is the first time I have told anyone about this.  ",-12

They also deny their fellow supports the opportunity to read conflicting points of view, which may sway their opinion, or may make their conviction stronger as they challenge the critical point of view. In short, a knee jerk down-vote, particularly if it comes without actually reading the article, is akin to sticking your head and the heads of others in the sand.

"Who we think is ""better looking"" is partially automatic, and partially learned.  If you've been trained as a child to value the particular characteristics of the race you belong to, (think Mixalot's ""I like big butts""), the other group may not seem so obviously better looking.

It's hard to *see* smarter.  And how successful you look in elementary, middle, and high school usually has more to do with your family than your individual accomplishments.  Why does that person come to school with a designer bag?  It's not because she's got a job at McDonalds....

Were you popular in high school?  I wasn't.  And so, when I had friends to sit with at lunch, I was happy for them.  If I went elsewhere for lunch, I was largely ignored, and occasionally insulted.  And I was white sitting with white people (... or close enough).  That changed in college-- if I needed somewhere to sit to eat, no one would make fun of me, I just might not be included in conversation if I didn't know anyone.  But the habits from middle/high school die hard...

You also seem to believe in self improvement.  You seem to think it's possible--even likely-- for you. Many minorities look at the people around them, look at the  people who have TV shows, political careers, tenure at universities, whatever-- and while it's no longer impossible to see themselves doing those things, it doesn't seem likely.  Their family often doesn't expect it of them.  Their family may not even be encouraging.  And this is all assuming they want it.  What if they personally define success differently?  And, of course, how success is defined is often defined by the culture you come from...  If the ""successes"" of your community are drug dealers, rappers, Oprah and Obama (non-exhaustive list!), it may seem easier to be a success as a drug dealer or gang member than to become president.....

"I'm happy to share my opinion. Let's take your questions in turn:

&gt; If the basis for ratings are the results of a test, 

What is the better metric? Really, I don't know of one. Happiness? Good nutrition? Most marijuana busts per student? I agree that test scores alone don't adequately judge the performance of a school but it's the best one we have. And, critical point here, the point of NCLB was to incrementally *improve* scores and raise the base level of young learners. We lag far behind many countries (too tired to quote stats, maybe someone else will or I'll look it up tmw) in basic math, science,  and language skills at the pre-secondary level. NCLB sought to raise the level over time, to show continuous improvement to get us to a reasonable baseline. That has not been accomplished yet so we are still trying to complete this historic improvement trend.

&gt;... and teacher pay is based on these results, 

If only! Teacher pay is based on all of the things that union jobs reward - years of service and education. Obama has taken the historic first step towards [performance-based pay](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/03/10/2009-03-10_president_obama_education_plan_calls_for-1.html) and, to me, it's very exciting. But it has no basis in NCLB.

&gt;...the job of teachers has in essence been shifted from educating broadly to narrowly tailoring their curricula as well as focusing on test taking techniques. 

I understand your point. I would argue, how is this different than before? My elementary school didn't work too hard on making me a better person but to fill me with knowledge, test my acquisition, then steer me towards a suitable education/career track. This is, and always has been, our banking system of education (lots of resources out there but [this is fresh and interesting](http://dynamicg.blogspot.com/2008/04/banking-system-of-education-outdated.html)).

&gt;To me (at least as I understand the legislation), the primary message to teachers is that the only rational option is not to inspire children to learn, but to adopt an almost entirely trivium based system of knowledge transfer.

Knowledge transfer is the definition of learning. That is the goal. The vehicle by which this is achieved varies, and I propose that inspiring i.e. opening minds, is the best way to teach, and the best way to learn.

It's easy to see this big bad government initiative as being evil or wrong. I just don't. I think it's about time we started putting value on our childrens learning, regardless of their race or location or income. They deserve a decent platform from which to make decisions later on. 

Schools that fail to perform (we can argue performance metrics all year and not ever completely solve it) have sanctions applied. Assuming they are fairly applied (huge assumption, I know) then we should be comfortable that students are then free to attend a better school i.e. one that performs at standard levels. Kids should not spend their short school careers waiting for us to figure out how to fix a school.

"What is this about public policy you speak of?

First of all, I don't agree that some races are inherently better than others.  Many cultures have valued certain traits or thought processes for such a long time that they have a more natural affinity for it.

However, it now begs the question:

Should we treat others based on how their ancestors once lived?  Colin Powell might never have been taken seriously, neither would have Barack Obama.  Filipinos should be considered a weak group of people, considering how many countries have invaded them.  Is this the public policy you where talking about?

Modern transportation allows people to emigrate their own countries and spread their genetic material to other areas.  Over time, a very long time, humans will have some genes that were associated historically with East Asia or North Africa or South America or Europe.  This won't be soon, but it will happen.  Airplanes, bullet trains and automobiles will help the homogeneity of the genetic pool. Yes, people have traveled before.

Some other things off the top of my head:

* Get ready for no air conditioning (my only real complaint)

* You can smoke in bars, which is either awesome or not, depending on whether you smoke

* Coffee to go is not common (no DD, Starbucks). Belgians do not drink coffee and walk; however they DO often eat their sandwiches on the go

* Clothing is expensive

* Don't convert prices in your head: $1 = 1€ - prices seem more normal if you think about it that way

* If you want water, you'll have to buy a bottle at many restaurants. It's not a scam - people seem to have accepted it as a fact of life. 

* Priorité à Droite (google it)

* Ditch your white socks, white sneakers, and shorts. Lower the volume when you talk.


In general, try swimming with the school - it's great if you don't fall into the trap (like lots of expats) of bitching about how slow the waiters are, there's no Costco, etc. Some people just love to bitch about things being different, and they don't enjoy the experience - so avoid those people.

"1942-1953 (12 years)

    * The Baby Boomers (Boom Genearation) were the generation born just after World War II, a time that included a 14-year increase in birthrate worldwide. Baby Boomers in their teen and college years were characteristically part of the 1960s counterculture, but later became more conservative.

1954-1965 (12 years)

    * Generation Jones was the heretofore lost generation between the Boomers and GenXers, which has emerged now as a bona fide distinct generation. The election of Barack Obama to the U.S. Presidency created significantly increased awareness of this generation as many prominent sources referred to Obama as specifically a member of Generation Jones.

1966-1978 (13 years)

    * Generation X is the generation born between approximately 1966 to 1979, and connected to the pop culture of the 1980s and 1990s they grew up in. Other names used interchangeably with Regan Generation, Generation X are 13th Generation and Baby Busters. Most of this generation are children of The Baby Boomers and The Silent Generation. Those born before 1973 spent most of their teen years in the 1980s.[1]

1978-2000 (22 years)

    * Generation weGeneration We—the Millennials—has arrived. They have emerged as a powerful political and social force. Their huge numbers and progressive attitudes are already changing America and the world. Millennials are the largest generation in American history. Born between 1978 and 2000, they are 95 million strong, compared to 78 million Baby Boomers. They are independent—politically, socially, and philosophically—and they are spearheading a period of sweeping change in America and around the world. No one knows the Millennials like Eric Greenberg. In Generation We, Greenberg explains the emerging power of the Millennial Generation, shows how they (and their supporters from other generations) are poised to change our nation and our world for the better, and lays out a powerful plan for progressive change that today's youth is ready to implement.

"That electronic voting machines are [being exploited to control elections](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3hUPP_bdOo).

Of all the circumstantial and anecdotal evidence, one politician's case still stands out as particularly chilling. Chuck Hagel from Nebraska won his first Senate seat in 1996 against a popular incumbent Democrat. He won almost every demographic, including blacks who had never before voted Republican in the state. The Washington Post (1/13/1997) called it ""the major Republican upset in the November election."" 

One thing Hagel never disclosed during his bid for the Senate is that he was once head of ES&amp;S, one of the three largest voting machine manufacturers in the country, and the one that has an 85% share in Nebraska's elections. He continues to this day to hold part interest in this company.

Six years later, in 2002 Hagel won 83% of the vote against Matulka. Matulka requested a hand-count only to learn that his request was denied because Nebraska had very recently passed a law that nobody, not even election workers, could look at a ballot. All recounts had to be done by machines. Eighty-five percent of the time these machines were ES&amp;S machines. 

Bev Harris of www.blackboxvoting.org was threatened with legal action from ES&amp;S when she went public about Hagel's involvement with the company. She responded by making the legal threat publicly available on her website.

Bev, along with The Hill's Alexander Bolton met with the Director of the Senate Ethics Committee and informed him about Hagel's failure to disclose his relationship with ES&amp;S. The director met with Hagel's office twice, and the afternoon of the second meeting he resigned from the Senate Ethics Committee. 

Meanwhile exit polls, the indicator most Americans relied on as sign of  the integrity of the election process, are becoming more rare with each election.

"well actually one of the criteria for the prize is actually the preceding year. It was specified in Nobel's testament. 

It is a little different with the science and literature awards, but the peace prize is more limited as such. Also giving the peace prize as a life time ward would render the prize less relevant. By giving it to Obama I think it continues to be relevant and a critical award.

He is absolutely not continuing Bush's policies. GITMO. They've stopped using torture, and they are releasing prisoners. Obama does have a huge problem here, but the Bush policy is NOT being continued. I wish he would take that further though. Iraq, he voted against going in in the first place, one of the few, and he has committed to withdraw. That is not an continuation of Bush policy. He has initiated talks, and ended the unilateralism that Bush and his cronies perpetrated. That god that nut case Bolton is out of the UN. Hi ended the missile defense shield and he has initiated the atomic bomb disarmament. Actually just about everything Obama is doing is different from Bush. 

It really has a lot to do with impact and none of the well deserving people or organizations you mentioned has the same impact as Obama. I think giving the prize to Obama puts even more pressure on him to do good and keep his promises.

I do agree it might seems as if I am sort of conflating two individual groups and that is not fair. However I sort of discount the far right as being part of the ""not relevant to discuss because nothing good can ever come of it"" group. Where I do think a lot of the criticism from people on the left and that you are bringing up is relevant to the discussion. Clearly I think you have a point, but I do think that you are discounting time here. For two reasons. First of all, the topics are incredibly complex, and if they are not handled correct I think Obama is in danger of being the ""lame duck"" early on. Secondly you cannot just turn back time and say this never happened. It did and it has to be handled. Now I do think that the war crimes should be taken seriously, and that it should be investigated. I think the reasons why it isn't is the president it sets. I might disagree, but I realize the issue is complex as I am sure you do too.
Now when that is said, Obama is making good on his promises. He promised to get out to Iraq, and the process has started, but you cannot just pack up and leave. The vacuum would make the whole region incredibly unstable. He has initiated talks of a world without atomic weapons, and

"Just look around you, and watch a bit of cable news. Right now ""moderation"" is a pretty dirty word. On the one hand you have fox news and right wingers who claim that ""Obamacare"" will lead to death panels and socialism. 

While the left is somewhat more moderate simply because it's in power (look at the far left during the Bush years if you think the left is intrinsically moderate), there is also a good deal of frustration that's manifesting itself as hyper partisanship (see the refusal of several liberal senators to consider anything that doesn't have a public option).

The irony is that Obama vs. McCain was an election between two professed centrists, and the percentage of the electorate who self-identify as ""independent"" is at an all time high. Part of this could be simply because extremes tend to generate more controversy and with that more ad revenues which is why you see them on the media... personally I'm not sure",1
"This is the correct answer.  The United States is, or is supposed to be, a nation of laws, not of men.  Any police officer - or anyone with arrest authority, which is a truly huge number of people in the United States - who witnesses the President committing an arrestable offense or who knows that an arrest warrant exists for the President, can arrest him.  There is not one word in the Constitution or anywhere else saying that the President is unarrestable.

The teacher's desired answer is, perhaps, the Sergeant at Arms, as noted in another comment.  This is incorrect, and frankly harmful to teach, since it suggests that the President is above ordinary laws.  If Obama guns down someone on the White House porch, any officer witnessing it not only can, but should, arrest him.  That's the difference between a kingdom and a democratic government: in a kingdom, whatever the king does, including gunning people down, is automatically legitimate.  In a non-kingdom, leaders must obey the laws like everyone else.  The teacher is teaching that the United States is a kingdom, with no support in law for that position, and the teacher deserves a hearty fuck you for that.

Whether this would actually occur is debatable.  Police officers, like everyone else, have a healthy respect for their own skins, and the officer who arrests the President is obviously taking a risk.

"A man makes a new friend, a guy by the name of Merv. One day the two were talking and Merv brings up Jay Leno, saying they're friends. The man doesn't believe it, so Merv offers to fly them both to L.A. for a Tonight Show taping. After the show, Merv introduces his new fried to Jay, and the three spend the evening touring L.A. in one of Jay's classic cars.

Another time, Merv mentions being friends with President Obama. ""No way,"" the man says. ""I could believe that you knew Leno, but not Obama!"" So Merv flies them both to Washington D.C., they go to the White House and are greeted immediately by the First Lady. They spend the rest of the evening watching movies with the president in the White House's screening room.

Yet another time, Merv and the man are talking about religion, and Merv mentions something the Pope told him. ""Wait,"" the man says. ""It was hard to believe you knew Leno, near-impossible to believe you know Obama, but don't tell me you know the Pope too!"" So Merv flies them both to the Vatican, where a monsignor meets them and tells Merv that he's welcome to stand next to the podium that day while the Pope celebrates mass. ""Your friend, though, will have to stay with the congregation.""

After the mass, Merv goes into the congregation to find his friend passed out cold. Merv revives him and asks what happened. The man says ""It was hard to believe you knew Leno, near-impossible to believe you know Obama, and wholly implausible to believe you know the Pope. But when the guy next to me said 'Who's that up there behind the podium next to Merv?', I couldn't take it anymore.""",46

Ultimately, I would be shocked if the bill doesn't pass, given the large Democratic majorities and the hit Obama and his party would take if they lose this fight. But if any party can screw this up, it would be the Democrats",3

"Bakersfield? My condolences. If you're the sterotypical redditor, you might not mesh with Bakersfield politically.

From Wikipedia:
&gt;Bakersfield differs from many California cities in that it is overwhelmingly conservative. In the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, John McCain carried Kern County by a 17.8% margin over Barack Obama, with Obama carrying the state by a 24% margin over McCain.[13] The same year, the county approved Proposition 8, which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, by 75.3% yes-24.7% no, the widest margin in any county statewide.[14]

On the other hand, maybe this doesn't even matter to you, or you might be more conservative than what I assume the average redditor is.

In any case, I figured it might be worth mentioning. The Central Valley in general kind of has a bad reputation among Californians in general, because it's (obviously) nowhere near the water, relatively rural compared to SF/LA/SD, and a lot more politically conservative.

"I voted for Obama, I think he is a great President. I took the religion test and scored 100% Secular Humanist. I volunteer to help young kids and for animals. I think too many people in the world are getting the shaft by the governments. However, if I look at things strictly logical, what would be best for the planet, not just a human centric version of that, I come to the conclusion that we are overpopulated. If any other animal increased population the level we have, we would immediately go out and put a bounty on them and slaughter them until the population was a sustainable amount. With humans we don't do that. I don't think that is right for animals either, I think you do it by controlling births and sterilization( for people with severe genetic disorders), not by murder. We could devise a DNA test, that would fail about 10-20% of the population based on genetic markers for the worst diseases. This would be genetic only, with race, color, creed, religion disqualified from even being known to the technician running the test. If you fail but your wife did not, there would be qualified sperm donors you could use. This would only affect a couple generations, and you would have eliminated some of the worst disorders on the planet, and strengthen our chances of survival. It would descrease the burden on everyone else, control healthcare costs, lower crime. Also if you are on state assistance, you should have to use birth control as long as you are on it, after you get off, you can have a kid, but will not be reeligible for assitance until you have the child.

The graphs I used were not 'my' graphs.

That was also why I said the other graphs that were more shocking were unfair to use. 

As far as the bailouts, I think it is disingenuous to blame the entirety of our malaise on Obama. The whole deficit does not belong to him; just as it does not belong to W. W's policies of not having adequate regulation, actively loosening regulation, and (albeit, by listening to his economic advisers) allowing Freddie and Fannie to buy up near as much junk as possible. 

This is a problem that should be at the feet of the executive as well as the legislative branches.  

My point is that Democrats do tax and spend (including raising spending), but Republicans cut taxes, raise spending, then borrow and spend. This makes what is spent on services and entitlements nearly invisible to most people. If taxes had to be raised to pay for the war, I have a feeling there would have been fewer hawks.  The phrase ""The Marines are at war. America is at the mall"" is extraordinarily accurate. Having a yellow magnet on your SUV (or hybrid or anything, really) is more of an empty gesture than anything else.

"The Obama administration [could totally close Gitmo today](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113237785&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1014), if it so chose.  All it would have to do is content itself with letting a bunch of prisoners go without fully knowing the reasons that the Bush administration put them there in the first place.  But if it doesn't want to do those things, then it has to deal with Republican pressure to work more slowly, congressional attempts to restrict necessary funds, the logistical problems of finding host countries for released detainees who would likely be persecuted if returned to their home nations, and a new set of legal protocols to replace the corrupt protocols initiated by the previous administration.

The administration could also order the withdrawal of all troops from Afghanistan if it chose to.  It would take them a while to get all of that material back to the U.S., of course, but if we rushed it we could probably have most of it back home by New Years, and the rest sold off to surrounding allies.  All that would require is leaving the Afghan border undefended and the Afghan people vulnerable to Taliban reprisals.  The upshot of the war there will have been the unwarranted raising of a lot of hopes, the destabilization of Northern Pakistan, and the eventual retrenchment of the Taliban in an expanded territory.

Yup, that all sounds good for peace to me.

I'm not saying that Obama was the best available candidate for the Prize this year, and it does seem like this was more of a political calculation than an estimate of Obama's actual achievements, but the OP makes it sound as though simply dropping all of the conflicts stirred up by the previous administration would have made Obama a better candidate for the Prize.  Which is absurd.  Regardless of whether or not he created those problems, Obama has inherited them as responsibilities, and the best we can expect of him and his administration is that they handle those issues responsibly.  Unfortunately, that means going slow on the issues of Gitmo and Iraq, but that doesn't mean that we aren't already committed to withdrawal on both.  And in the case of Afghanistan, I would say that the interests of peace are, sadly, best served by an intensification of military presence in the hope of improving security.

The big breach of the peace, and the clearest continuation of Bush-era military policy, to my mind, is the way we've been conducting operations in Northern Pakistan.  The use of drones and long range weapons there seems to be causing as much suffering and destruction as it's preventing, and we desperately need to find a better way of restoring order to that region -- preferably by enabling Pakistan to deal with Taliban presence there, and without empowering more dangerous elements within Pakistan's government itself.",1

"**tl;dr -** Beck's program is getting hurt in the wallet by an exodus of advertisers after he called Obama a racist, so Beck is attempting to discredit and defame the most vulnerable target associated with the group getting advertisers to drop Beck.

**Full Explanation -** Van Jones is a founder of Color of Change, which is the group that has led the charge to get companies to pull their advertisements from Glenn Beck's Fox News program (over 50 have pulled ads so far) because Glenn Beck said - and never apologized for saying - that President Obama ""has a deep-seated hatred for white people.""

Van Jones is a fairly easy target, given some activities he participated in in the past, like getting arrested protesting after the Rodney King riots (charges were later dropped and Jones won a settlement against the arresting police force). Jones became disaffected and admits to having communist opinions, but has most recently been supporting eco-capitalism. Beck can hold him up and say, ""See? This guy just wants to tear down white people! He admits he's a commie!"" and the ignorant viewers of Fox will believe that having divergent political opinions and being an activist for minority rights means he wants to destroy America.

It's all bullshit, mostly due to the fact that Color of Change hit Beck's show right where it hurts the most - the wallet. Beck alleges discrimination and violation of free speech rights, but Color of Change is just convincing private corporations to explicitly not support Beck's message of racial intolerance by pulling advertising from Beck's show.

Additionally, Jones is an adviser to the Obama Administration on Green Jobs, or environmentally-friendly economic policies that will improve the environment and create jobs. It's a double-whammy for Beck, he gets to denigrate the group organizing the advertiser boycott of his show while simultaneously implicating the Obama Administration's participation or knowledge of this simply because Jones works with them on a completely unrelated issue.",3

People will throw their hands in the air and say ""Anybody but Bush!"" and mean it. If you can create the character that people love to hate, you'd be falling right into the plans of someone who wants to go beyond it. They don't want America to *have* a leader. They want a corporation, a council, and committee.

Bush is no accident. He was a dunce, to go to the dinners when Cheney and Rumsfeld and others controlled what was going on. - They got us into Iraq, they got the military-industrial complex rolling again. Anything beyond that, they don't care. They're not after glory or respect or to be admired by history.

Cheney was our president. Maybe Bush had control of domestic affairs, but Cheney was the one calling the shots when it mattered. - The failure of Bush isn't an ""Oops."" He was a convenient way in by people who couldn't otherwise be elected. - You wouldn't *vote* for Dick Cheney, but he's the guy to whom the guy you voted for would turn. All the power, none of the spotlight.

Corporations are international beings with no loyalty to the United States. If they can turn a profit by gutting the infrastructure of the United States (giving bad loans to everyone and then betting against them) and eventually driving it bankrupt, you're not shitting in your own backyard. You have a new backyard. - Halliburton is now based in Dubai. Oil companies have no patriotic feelings toward the U.S. - They have higher GDPs than many developed countries. 

If you want to run the world, the best way to do so is by *ruining* the strongest competition. We're bankrupt and in over our heads, but people still make billions of dollars off of it and will continue to do so until there's nothing left. When that happens, they'll have an easier time than we will. The United States will be bankrupt, and they won't. - You don't want a strong leader for that.

Despite Obama's ambitions, he's a relative unknown, hated by as many people as those who love him. He can be the anti-Bush, but he's still the perfect guy for the next stage of the process. Not to say that he has anything to do with them or that he's doing it *for* them, but that they've stacked the cards to get him here. If you have a guy who will rely on lots of advisers to make up for his inexperience, you don't need to control *him* if you have control over the advisers.

Not to point the finger *at* Timothy Geithner, but he's probably not the guy Obama *would* have left in had it not been for the economic crisis right before Obama came into office. - He didn't want to change the guard in the midst of a shitstorm, so that's who he had to trust.

If Tim Geithner has an agenda that doesn't go with Obama's, Obama still has to suck it up. He has little control in the face of corporations who can make or break our entire economy.

If you're looking for a one-world government, the best way to get it is to destroy what is already in place. One bank, one currency. You're either with them or you're not. No limitless freedoms. Their way or you're screwed. - You can't do that while there's still a functioning government. 8 years of Bush pushed that along. He may have personally been a colossal failure, but he suited their agenda.

"I'm paraphrasing a fairly well-known quote, but the most powerful vote you have is what you do (or don't do) with your money.

Your money directly supports things, but mostly indirectly.  (Directly, giving to campaigns probably has more of an impact than your vote.  Obama raised a ton of money from many contributors, helping him beat Clinton in the primaries, and most of the money didn't come from the actual state the primary or caucus was being held in.)

In any case, I don't think we can downplay the role of money in politics, on a personal level, which includes the products we buy, the taxes we pay, and the candidates we support.  And that this is more powerful than our vote.

As for the military, I know a lot of people who joined the military.  Anecdotal, to be sure.  But not one of them wanted to fight in a war or kill anyone.  But some of them (depending on what they were doing) knew that was a possibility.  

The US military has about 1.5 million active-duty, and about 1.5 million reserve.  There are 115k troops in Iraq, or 8% of active-duty, 4% of total including reserve.  That's a hell of a lot of people, to be sure.  But it is a fraction of the total.

I am against the Afghanistan plan, mostly because of (what I consider) idiotic ROE.  But if I were in charge right now, I don't know what I'd do.  I don't think you can just pull everyone out of Iraq and Afghanistan and not clean up the mess we've made.  And especially in Iraq, leaving can't be done overnight.  Estimates I've read range from 10 to 18 months, and the entire time the soldiers would be targets.

"3 months: August 11, 2009 - Up is an easier guess than down for the US economy, especially consumer confidence.  Gas prices higher than today, lower than last summer.

1 year: May 11, 2010 - Unemployment lower than today, higher than 2000 when Bush first took office. General consensus that the worst of the recession has past. Iran continues a modest uranium enrichment program - but fewer running centrifuges than today.  Negotiations about Iran's nuclear program are ongoing, but accept that Iran will have some domestic enrichment capacity. Israel has not bombed another party since Gaza 2008/9. Zardari out of Pakistan presidency.  Karzai out of Afganistan presidency.  US troops still in Iraq, not in cities.

5 years: May 11, 2014 - Obama reelected in 2012.  Recession fully over. No two state referendums have been held regarding Israel/Palestine. One state, ending Zionism as a project, is mainstream/dominant liberal position on conflict. Mubarak has died by now.  Egypt run by his son, who is under substantial, but not intense pressure to institute democratic reforms and end state of emergency.  US has presence in Iraq, but Iran has more influence there.

10 years: May 11, 2019 - Reddit.com mostly forgotten.  Apple and Google are the most hated tech companies. OpenOffice surpasses MS office in market share.  MS Windows of some form at &gt;70, &lt;90 market share for desktop computers.  &gt;40 market share for portable computers that are what people really care about.  Cell smartphones are actually decent cameras (with flashes) and video recorders.  Video social networking, using mobile computers is massively popular.  The US economy has had a couple of booms and recessions since 2009.  Israel exists, with a Jewish majority, but that is clearly being phased out.  Egypt is for the most part democratic.  There have been political reforms in Iran.  Iran and US have normal relations and full trade.  Iran is ""nuclear-capable"" as Japan and Brazil are today.  Iran imports uranium and sells enriched uranium on world market but has not tested or built a weapon.  The United States is substantially more liberal than today.  Both parties, have shifted to their lefts.  Democratic party won three elections Obama, Obama, some woman - first time since Reagan, Reagan, Bush.

Obama,1
"When Obama took office, .. there seemed to be this huge collective sigh of relief. For weeks afterward you could walk around outside and people held their heads higher. People actually said hello to strangers. Random people would pitch in and help at unexpected times. There was a new hope that we could actually make a difference if we focused on the right things (having a positive attitude, doing concrete things to help our community,etc). It's basically like people realized instead of being cynical and complaining about how bad things were getting, that we could redirect that energy into being positive and helping. 

Sure, things are pretty shitty. The economy is in the crapper. There are still world events and military engagements that are unpopular. ... but on the whole, I find the renewed hopeful attitudes are still very prevalent. Times may be hard, but people are still willing to do the hard work because Obama is setting a great example for what it means to lead a nation. 

EDIT: I realize that last paragraph makes me sound like some glittery-eyed Obama lover... I do like him, but I don't think he's perfect, nor do I think he alone can fix every problem. What I find encouraging and uplifting is his leadership. He's just a classy guy. (Even the very small things like how he interacts with people,etc.) He's setting a tone (and a new bar) for what it means to lead a nation. And thats commendable. ",5

Not true. 

His diplomatic and political prowess have changed the nature of the foreign policy of the world's only superpower from one of xenophobic belligerence to multilateral negotiation and compromise. He's done this in the face of incessant attacks from the opposition at home. Granted it's early days yet, and this is nothing as concrete as a peace agreement, but it is a significant achievement for any man.

"&gt; A ton of the people protesting Obama's reforms are angry because they think it's socialism,

Well, it *is*.

&gt; which they associate with communism

Well, it *is* associated.  Both ideologies have ""egalitarianism at all costs"" as the underpinning utopian final goal; the difference is the mechanism used to achieve it:

1. Communism denies the private property of means of production.  Communists must use violence / threats to achieve that state, because property is a natural feature of post-caveman human beings.
2. Socialism / socialdemocracy denies property altogether by first giving it lip service, but then claiming a special ""exception"" for the rulers and certain domains of human action, to take people's private property.  Socialists must use violence / threats to achieve that state, because property is a natural feature of post-caveman human beings.

Both ideologies have at their core the belief that violence against peaceful people and the violation of property / humans is OK / permissible / moral if the authorities are the ones executing it.  This is no different (from an inconsistency / exceptionalism perspective) from saying that the Amadors (my family) have a right to kill you, but your family has no right to kill anyone.  In the name of everyone ""being equal"" or ""having equal opportunities"".  Can you believe how absurd that is?  Clearly, if a group is allowed to violate your property rights (with violence and threats, may I remind you), then you *no longer have* property rights because axiomatically a right is either universal, or *it is not a right at all*.

If you ask me, at least communists are more sincere.  Socialists are like the rapists that say ""Oh, I am absolutely against rape... but if rape gets people educated, roads built, and police forces paid, then I guess I would let the politicians put only the tips of their penises up people's vaginas and asses.  Surely you don't want chaos and anarchy on the streets, right?  So split them legs up!"".  You cannot be ""in favor of X"", make up exceptions to X for some arbitrary people / reasons / circumstances, and then claim that you are following a principle because you are raping the principle to begin with.  The fact that socialists do, exposes them for the relativists, self-contradictory and deceitful ideologues that they are.  Hypocrisy is the label we use to denounce people who claim that they have principles but conveniently find exceptions and excuses not to apply them.

Anyway, as you can see, the principle of ""egalitarianism"" is logically at odds with the principle of property rights.  One cannot believe in both principles at the same time.",3
"""(a) You are going to have to choose an issue. My fingers would fall of if I tried everything.""

Fair enough.  How about health care reform?

""(b) Teleprompter. There will be a death panel. Private insurance firms have those also. Obama might not be a natural born citizen. He is an American yes. But until he shows his long form birth certificate. No one knows. BTW Hawaii does give birth certificates for children born out of State.""

Whether he's using a teleprompter or not doesn't change the fact that the people who support him aren't following him because he's yelling louder or longer.  When he speaks he uses facts, he lays his position out clearly and calmly, and he gives his reasons for holding it.  So your point doesn't really address the question. 

Just because you say there will doesn't mean there will be.  What is your reason for believing this?  Where is it in the document?  Of course private insurers have them, that's what the recission and pre-existing condition clauses are there for.  That's why we desperately need a public option at minimum and, at best, a single payer system.  There would be no reason for a publicly funded insurer to rescind coverage, since they are not required by their shareholders to increase their profits every quarter.  In fact, a publicly funded insurer would NEVER turn a profit, nor should it.  Public insurance is the only way I have yet heard to insure that we _won't_ have 'death panels'.

He can't show his long form, because the Hawaii Department of Health doesn't honor requests for copies of that form.  The short form has all the information required by the State Department to prove citizenship by birth.  There are sworn testimonies from several people that they have personally seen and handled the long form.  Even _if_ President Obama was born outside of the United States to a mother who was an American citizen, there is no clear definition that says that would make him not a 'naturally born citizen'.  That term is not defined in the Constitution, and has never been defined by the Supreme Court.  There are legal arguments on both sides, however, since there are documents showing that President Obama _was_ born in Honolulu, and none showing that he _was not_, it is incredibly unlikely that a decision on the matter will ever have to be made in regards to his eligibility.  Oh, also, there was a birth announcement in the local paper.  Sources follow:

""(c) NO founding fathers were far right even past libertarians. They were trying to escape the English government

WOW

After all, they're the ones who came up with 'all men are created equal' and wanted to guarantee the right to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'

Yes democrats want the opposite of that. They want groups to be more then equal by taking from others.

They are sort of communising threw laws now. Better to control with the unseen hand.""

I didn't bring up the founding fathers in some attempt to prove that conservatives are socialists, I brought them up to point out that claiming that holding these ideals is somehow 'anti-American', or trying to 'destroy America' is ludicrous.  I'm glad we're in agreement - those of us who want socialised care are just trying to uphold the principles the country was founded on.  Democrats specifically do NOT want the opposite of that.  Also 'more equal than others' is a self contradictory statement.  What we have right now is a system in which the right to 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness' is distinctly not available to all, insofar as we need medical care to live our lives fully and to pursue happiness.  Under the system we have right now, that right is not available to everyone equally, it is only available to the rich or lucky.  We don't want to give better care to some people than others.  In fact, if the private insurers become the 'deluxe' option that only the rich can afford, fine by me.  I just want everyone to have adequate health care, so that we can all be guaranteed the right to live and pursue happiness equally.  What's special interest about that?  Also, how is it 'taking from others'?  Last I checked, we all pay taxes.

"I'm 18, and I live in southern Illinois, it's far from Chicago.  The nearest movie theater is 20 miles away.  The only real store we have is Walmart, and the only sit down restaurants we have are Applebee's and some local places.  Most people here are conservative, and while I try to respect their opinion, election years are sometimes not bearable.  I'm still in high school, and after 4 years of having an political opinion that disagrees with almost everyone, I have learned to shut my mouth to keep my friends.  I'm not real, and I can't be.  While there are some kids that believe the same things that I do, none of them are in my classes.  I'm in mostly honors classes, and the kids in there are very conservative and opinionated.  Most of the people who are my friends are only that way because they think I'm a good Christian boy, when the truth is I only go to church to please my parents.  Otherwise, I'm a non-believer.  

At the school, teachers sometimes express their personal opinions too freely.  I have an English teacher that has asked us to pray for her friend.  She has obsessed with anything to do with the holocaust.  When we read things in class, there is always a character or some symbol of Christ or Hitler.  We had a discussion in class one day about whether the Jews killed Jesus.  She told us this long story about how that was a myth and used the bible and a book written by a pastor as a source.  I looked up the book on amazon and it seemed to be a book that believed Israel could do no wrong.  I don't see how it could be unbiased at all.  Mrs. X also has a facebook where she her about me reads, 'I love God' and is a member of many groups devoted to Churches.  While I really don't mind people having their own beliefs and opinions, this woman takes them into the public school classroom, stating stories from The Bible as fact.  Our school has no complaint box.  While I would like to send in a complaint about this teacher, there is no way to do it anonymously, and the school officials believe the same things she does.  

Most other students have the same opinions as the teacher.  I have seen a girl be verbally attacked because her sister is diabetic and stem cells were mentioned.  She supported the research and was martyred.  We have a student news program that plays every morning.  During the election coverage and even still some now, I would always hear heckling of Obama and rude comments that have nothing to do with his policies.  Students also make racist, unnecessary jokes.  The honors students are some of the worst.  They think asians don't have to pay for college and that blacks can't earn an honest living.  While I will admit that I find some racist jokes to be funny, I find more humor in the stereotype than the actual pain the words cause an individual.  These students make fun of all other races, but seem to leave whites out of their humor.

"&gt; returns are diminishing every year.

What are you talking about? Endowments are growing by leaps and bounds every year. Prices are determined by one thing and one thing only: ""how much can this person afford now, and if we give a loan, assuming they attain their intended major, how much disposable income will they have over the next X years to pay us?"" Why else do you think they set the tuition at some astronomical rate, and then expect you to prove you cannot pay for it by providing bank account balances and tax returns to show you do not have the funds, upon which time you magically get a grant (from others if possible, from them if need be) which is from their own pocket, so it is essentially a discount, in conjunction with a loan. They aren't about to take a loss on educating you.

Universities often lobby politicians (Barack Obama and Jim Webb being two great examples, check opensecrets.org for data) to put these types of laws in place, because when the government decides they will end up issuing Pell grants or GI Bills to pay for peoples college, colleges can then add those to their current bag of tricks (scholarships, grant and loans) to safely increase tuition and profits. Let me reiterate this, when the government pays for college, tuition prices go up. 

Think about it, a) Universities train the MBAs, they know these business practices better than anyone, b) Medical School, Business School and Law School, how expensive are those? Anything like what doctors, lawyers and executives make in salary? Is this really a coincidence?

Generally Americans are thought to be extremely America-centered and stupid.  I used to think this is true and to some extent, I have found it to be true now that I have lived in America.  

Americans do live in a very America-focused world, so it's not surprising that people aren't fully aware of other countries, but I am amazed when some of you guys can't locate major world countries like Iraq on the map or differentiate between countries and continents (someone asked how long it takes to 'drive' to Africa WTF).

"Not confrontational at all!  However, I'm not actually a Republican.  I'm somewhere between liberal and libertarian.  I voted for Obama, and I liked what his economic advisors were saying about healthcare.  I'm disappointed in the direction it's going, though, to the point where I might have preferred McCain on this issue.

We might have a misunderstanding concerning my third point.  My assertion is that doctors have a financial incentive to perform procedures since they are paid per procedure.  Therefore, they do too much, not too little.  Steven Levitt discusses in the book Freakonomics how doctors perform more C-sections when times are bad and they need the money (all other factors being held equal).  This can be intentional, or just subconscious, or due to a poor understanding of statistics.  (An article in Scientific American here http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=knowing-your-chances discusses how the vast majority of doctors have a poor grasp of probability.)

As for solutions, the main thing I wanted was to get rid of employer provided coverage, which McCain's plan would have done.  Obama's advisers all agreed with that part.  Obama was saying otherwise, I was hoping it was just cynical election talk, like his comments about NAFTA.  (See http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122488864905768469.html )

But now we have Obama's plan, and it's just keeping the status quo as far as employer provided coverage goes.  There are penalties for companies *not* providing coverage.  You can't even switch from your employer's coverage to the public option.  How does that ""keep private insurers honest?""  The main reason companies behave is the consumer's ability to go elsewhere, and it doesn't sound like we're increasing that at all.  Insurance tied to your job is the worst of all possibilities.  It's great that the 10% of people who can't get insurance now will be covered, but that could have just been tweaking Medicaid eligibility.  The real opportunity is still being missed.",1

I decided he would enter the ""back"" way, which was actually the side of the building, since it was on a corner.

"Actually, I think there's a nugget of relevancy in comparing Beck to Adolph; they both use emotional tricks to incite their followers (the weeping, the posturing), cultivating an us-vs-them mentality where the 'us' is threatened with death &amp; downfall by the ubiquitous &amp; shadowy 'them'; he &amp; Adolph both encourage their followers to arm themselves against 'the conspiracy', and he &amp; Adolph have both demonstrated a disregard for facts that amazes people who know the actual situation.

Certainly, Godwin's law highlights the abusive capability in comparing everyone &amp; everything to Adolph Hitler- but, in this case, one side calls their enemy a fascist, a socialist, a communist &amp; a black supremacist simultaneously; anyone familiar with history knows immediately that each of those ideologies is incompatible with the last and it would be impossible to be all things at once.

Unfortunately, on the other side, Mr. Beck does practice fascist-like propensities, while appropriating the label and many others, for President Obama and liberals; in my humble opinion, this represents the logical progression from the GOP policy of 'admit nothing, deny everything, make counter-accusations' - in short, if they can stick the label(s) to President Obama, then there's not as much danger of being called on their own reprehensible behavior even if it smacks of the same.",1

"&gt; You'll find that you reinforce whatever you pay the most attention to

This is totally true.  Two specific experiences that demonstrate this come to mind:

1.  About 5 or 6 years ago I cut my cable subscription because I was a poor college student.  Aside from the extra free time it gave me, a lot of the problems the OP mentioned significantly decreased.  The usual frivolous crap associated with western culture started working its way out of my daily thoughts.  I became less tense, I found it easier to focus and for longer periods of time... life just became generally happier.  I have no intention to subscribe to broadcast television ever again.
2. Back around the time Obama first started campaigning, I started getting more interested in politics.  Slowly but surely, as I became more familiar with the political landscape in the US, I became more cynical, jaded, and generally pissed off at the state of everything in this country.  This culminated in me flipping out a few weeks back, triggered by the flood of healthcare crap.  I decided I just had to step back and not worry about it.  I'm much happier for that.

Also, I posted in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9cjmp/whats_one_thing_your_parents_told_you_that_you) that the music you listen to affects your mood and the way you think... I'm pretty sure that's another application of this more general principle.

"The principle freedom people in the USA really hold to is the freedom to be whatever they want.  Here's a real-life story that illustrates what I mean.

A friend of mine at church holds a PhD from an American university.
She never expected to go to college at all, because she did poorly
on a standardized test as a child (I think she was 12).  One test, and the
UK school system had decided she had no business going to college.
She was shunted away from harder classes, on the basis
of a single standardized test, which she couldn't even retake.  The
entire rest of her educational career, and thus life course, was decided by people in the government who knew best, because the Infallible Test said so.

Her family moved to the States a few years later.
She found her American high school easy, but when she
was asked what college she was going to, she was shocked.  In the UK,
the colleges pick you, and none would ever pick her, all because of
*one* test she took as a child.  In the States, you had to pick some colleges, and
apply, and do lots of other such work.  She found the US system
bizarre, but because of the opportunities it afforded her, she wouldn't
change a thing.

She now works as a therapist who helps kids with emotional and
behavioral problems.  It's important work, and she's good at it.  And
if she'd stayed in the UK, she'd never have been able to do it.

I prefer our system, for all its flaws, because it means an individual
who is willing to work can make his or her own decisions.  Maybe the
test says you'll wash out: but you can go to the community college
anyway if you've got the drive to do it.  The USA is supposed to be
""the land of opportunity"", and for my friend at church it really truly
was.  It's not just a cliché to her.

Another obvious example is starting a business: in the States, you don't need a lot of money, you don't have draconian hiring laws to keep you from getting rid of people who need firing, you can incorporate cheaply, and you can run the company out of your garage (see Apple, HP, Google, Ford Motor, etc).  In some foreign countries, you have a hard time firing people who don't perform, or you need tens of thousands of euros in capital to incorporate.  That's why we use Google from our Apple computers instead of accessing a search engine started in France from computers made by a German company.

[Maslow's Hierarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) says that ""self-actualization"" is the highest need of humans, but you can only get it if the lower ones have been met.  So far as I can make out, many countries with better health care and the like satisfy the lower elements on Maslow's list, but they do so at the price of the upper end.  You can start a company in the states and make things if you want to.  You can have the chance to go to college no matter who you are (see ""Barack Obama""), and no government board comes along and dictates what your opportunities are.

The freedom to be whatever you want is the big one.  Americans tend to be insular, so if that freedom exists elsewhere, we probably wouldn't know.  But it's so important that anything which even hints of losing it makes us very unhappy.

"Two big things:

Of course, they'd have probably given a bullshit answer, but you could explain it to them later. In my opinion, the biggest failing of public education right now is that it doesn't encourage curiosity nearly enough.

Second, I'd have a very strict ""no politics, no religion, no fox news"" policy with your parents. If they get all huffy and start with the whole ""We're gonna teach her to be a good god fearing republican whatever you say!"" I'd simply tell them that no, they won't, because your daughter won't be allowed with them on her own.",6

I worked for a business owner who actually tried to get around the laws that state employees can leave work to vote, because he knew that most of his staff would vote for Obama, and he is a HUGE McCain/NeoCon supporter.

This two-party system is garbage since both parties are the same, and until the old farts who are stuck in their ways pass away, we're not going to see much change.

A side story, when the elections were being held, I was at a local spot, and what was sad is that a lot of the people there were my age (I actually went to high school with a couple of the people there.)  And what struck me was that they had the mentality of their parents in regards to electing politicians.  Even worse, I asked a couple of them (since we were friends, or friendly) to explain why they voted for McCain, and their response was that Obama is black.  That's the ONLY reason they came up with.  Furthermore, I asked them to layout McCain's economic plans, or to even name ANYTHING on McCain's agenda, and they couldn't, however, they quickly jumped all over ""OBAMA IS GONNA TAKE OUR GUNS!""

It was absolutely amazing.",8

"&gt; Economic theories start with this as their first assumption.

Economists are more interested in market failures than the perfect market you describe because (surprise!) perfect markets don't exist.  There is no such thing as ""perfect reasoning"" because people have imperfect information and are constrained by many other factors.  You should have learned this in your second week of high school microecon.

&gt; By the way, I worked at the national headquarters of a multinational bank for ten years.  I'm more like one of the guys they interviewed when they wrote the textbooks for classes on modern economic theory.

You're making a fallacious [argument from authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority).  Also, if you had looked at an econ textbook recently you would know that they don't ""interview"" people for content.  Even if they did, I doubt they would seek out a beancounter.

&gt; Now, I suppose there's all this justification about how it's easier to tap the letters in that arrangement one at a time with the stylus?

No, QWERTY was designed for typewriter/keyboard typing.  Your mobile uses it because it would be absurd for everyone to learn a new key layout customized for electronic device they own.  One day when the most common input device isn't a keyboard QWERTY will probably no longer be the dominant layout.

&gt; half the population calling Obama a Socialist...

Your point being what?  People are crazy.  In general, governments around the world are less corrupt, more accountable and democratic, and go to war with each other less than 100 years ago.  People will always be crazy, but that has nothing to do with political science.

&gt; That's like saying ""even though the roulette wheel lands on random numbers and has no memory of past spins, I have a way to predict its randomness.""

However, being independent, it was able to chart its own path, and the teacher-to-teacher relationships were uncommonly strong.  Other schools out-performed us in talent and future student achievement (Obama went to Punahou, not our school, for example), but our school had by far the best *community* and the best social experience I have ever witnessed.

Additionally, the city of Washington DC had made 3 or 4 times that in industry surrounding it ( hotels, restaurant, vendors, transportation, ect).

"Obama Adviser Brzezinskis Off-the-record Speech to British Elites

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKzEpQc-yo8


Written by William F. Jasper
Friday, 21 November 2008 13:31

Zbigniew Brzezinski, a senior adviser to President-elect Barack Obama on matters of national security and foreign policy, was the featured speaker at Chatham House in London on November 17, 2008. The title of his lecture was Major Foreign Policy Challenges for the Next US President. Although Chatham House events are known to attract the great and the good of Englands political, financial, and academic elites — as well as many of its top media representatives — there has been virtually no word as to what Brzezinski had to say in any of the worlds press.

This is but the latest example of the hermetic seal known as the Chatham House Rule, which states:

When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.

Chatham House, in St. James Square, London, is the headquarters of the powerful Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA), founded in 1920 as the principal front organization of the secret Round Table network of Cecil Rhodes, famous for his fabulous wealth from Africas gold and diamond mines. The RIIA was founded in conjunction with its sister organization in the United States, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which is headquartered at the Pratt House in New York. Pratt House also has formally adopted the Chatham House Rule, as has the U.S. State Department (which has been dominated by CFR members for seven decades) and other U.S. agencies.

Thus, we frequently have top U.S. officials speaking privately to audiences of American and foreign elites concerning matters of great importance to the American people, but the content of those talks is off-limits to the American public. This especially should be a matter of concern if the matters these elites are discussing involve plans that will dramatically impact our society, our economy, and our political system.

Brzezinski and his friends at the RIIA and CFR assure us that nothing of the sort ever happens at these gatherings. However, I did attend one of Brzezinskis lectures at a globalist conference, where the content certainly was disturbing. It was Mikhail Gorbachevs 1995 State of the World Forum in San Francisco, and Brzezinski was one of the key speakers. He was frustrated that the new millennium was only five years away, but his long-sought goal of world government was still far off. We do not have a new world order, he told the audience, a veritable Whos Who of world finance, business, politics, media, and academia. We cannot leap into world government in one quick step, Brzezinski noted. Attaining that objective, he explained, would require a gradual process of globalization, building the new world order step by step, stone by stone through progressive regionalization.

Through his writings — as well as his policies while President Jimmy Carters national security adviser — Brzezinski has demonstrated that he is committed to the globalist world view of the RIIA/CFR and the Trilateral Commission (which he helped found, becoming its first director) rather than the constitutionalist view of our Founding Fathers. Rather than a sovereign, independent, constitutional republic, he is committed to a new world order that proposes steadily encroaching international controls and institutions, leading gradually, steadily to an America that is submerged and subsumed in a world government.

Those familiar with the writings, speeches, policies, and public records of the many public figures who attend (and speak before) these globalist gatherings understand that Brzezinskis views on these matters are not his alone; they are shared by many (if not most) of those in attendance. They are the people who set policies and determine the course our nation will take. They prattle regularly about their commitment to transparency in government. Yet they themselves speak at off-the-record gatherings such as the recent Chatham House event where Brzezinski was the featured speaker.",2

Now that Obama is in charge and is still enforcing the Patriot Act, still waging illegal wars, still illegally wiretapping American citizens and believe me at this very moment someone somewhere is screaming under the ministrations of an American torturer - I've been deserted by my lefty friends who somehow support Obama in all of his endeavors - legal or not.

"Everybody is attracted to physically attractive people. Duh. Hell, we're all attracted to movie stars, right? I'd like a piece of President Obama, personally.

But most people do learn to differentiate between an unrealistic attraction and a realistic one. Additionally, most people eventually figure out that it's much more important to be with someone whose goals and expectations match theirs, with whom they can have a conversation, and who cares about and respects them rather than putting them down.

Of course, it's important to be physically attracted to the person you're with. After a long time, it's normal to love them in a more companionate than passionate way, but it's not normal to continually start a relationship with someone you're not attracted to in a passionate way in the first place, then leave them for that reason.

Sounds like your problem isn't a girl problem. It's a self-fulfillment problem. You don't seem like you like yourself very much, yet you sort of would like a hot woman to walk into your life and magically change all that. Like Raedix says, it's about time you started working out in a way you enjoy, dressing better, and taking up some hobbies that *you* enjoy that also happen to involve physical activity and human contact.

If you can meet some of your own needs that you normally allow a girlfriend to meet despite feeling she's inadequate in terms of looks, you won't need to throw yourself at any woman who will have you anymore, and you won't be continually unavailable because of your strings of unsatisfying relationships. What happens when the hot woman genuinely attracted to you comes along, but she's a nice gal and wouldn't dream of going for you because you're with someone else-- someone you're not happy with?

tl;dr -- You're not going to attract a movie star, but if you quit settling and learn to make yourself happy, you might just attract someone you're attracted to.",3
"Dammit Richard, he's a President, not a miracle worker.

Obama's just starting to clean up the messes of past presidents, most recently those of George W. Bush but also a sprinkling of Clinton's as well.

"File that under 'diversity'. Find friends from all over the spectrum -- not just by ages, but by race, politics and income. When all your friends and associates are from the same basic background as you, you develop a narrow outlook on the world. I think that this country, especially, needs people to reach out beyond their 'small circle of friends', especially in politics. It's amazing how polarized we are e.g. with the Obama presidency. Some people love him, others hate and fear him. Nobody really understands why the other feels that way. America, we need to *talk*!",1
"Haha I do something similar to that.  When a serious movie is on that has worked so hard to get the viewer emotionally invested, I like to imagine the most absurd shit taking place during the climax that totally ruins the entire movie then cuts to ""The End""  (i.e. random dinosaur runs through and eats the main character, UFO abduction, fart during a dramatic pause, Ricky Martin popping in and singing Livin' La Vida Loca etc. you get the idea)  

Or if I'm watching Obama give a speech I just imagine the crowd reaction if he walked to the mic and yelled out something dumb from the most powerful position on earth, ""Poopstains!"" ""Word, word, balls up!"" ""Thundercats Hooo!"" etc.

Or if I'm having a serious discussion with someone (boss, person at the counter, doctor, etc.) I think of how I could absolutely ruin it and say something absurd like a dead serious ""I love you"" or ""No, no, anything but that"", ""I am your father"" etc.

"&gt;I hope you never lose your sense of wonder 
You get your fill to eat 
But always keep that hunger 
May you never take one single breath for granted 
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed 
I hope you still feel small 
When you stand by the ocean 
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens 
Promise me you'll give faith a fighting chance

"These are all the same nonsense excuses that Bush gave when he was President. Remember, Obama is ""pulling out"" (though hundreds of thousands of troops and mercenaries are still there!) of Iraq under the Status of Forces Agreement negotiated by... Bush!

Obama's bold strategy of perpetual, brutal occupation is no different from Bush's plans either. If anything, it's worse.

The man is occupying two foreign lands by force. It is a disgusting obscenity to give him a prize for promoting world peace.",1
"&gt;When did the 'debate' begin to equate Hitler and fascism with socialism?

It's nothing new, the side you don't agree with is always ""Hitler,"" regardless of if it's Bush or Obama.

Honestly equating any oppressive government to ""left"" or ""right"" is a bit silly.

Different dictators use different rationalizations to seize power, whether they appeal to the left or the right in order to take power is pretty much meaningless in practice.  The outcome is the same.",2
It's not fair to say that Obama has done nothing - but a lot of these are hardly significant changes that hasten us toward world peace.,1

"It's not contradictory to be a homophobic, racist, anti-semitic Libertarian.  It just means that his ""free thinking"" is poor and starts being an issue when he supports such legislation. 

I get a little frustrated at seeing people here associating all negative personal qualities with Republicans.  It smells a lot like how someone who dislikes Obama might try to associate him with Hitler and the Nazis.

I know plenty of closed-minded Democrats and stupid Libertarians, even if such attributes are more common at tea parties.",1
"I'm all for it, but Obama and the Dems wouldn't implement that in this stimulus bill. The GOP could easily attack this as ""pork spending"" and using ""big government to change the way Americans live.""

I don't really agree with these assertions, I'm just saying the concept of doing this has the potential to be very polarizing.",3

Antisemitism at this point means you want to discuss the palestinian problem from a even handed view point. Obama will be called an antisemite the first time the Israeli's do the next security operation in Gaza if he doesn't send them a fresh shipment of bombs when they ask.,1
