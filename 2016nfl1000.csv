What you said actually ended up contradicting your point because you gave two falsehoods. The Oline passed my very scientific 'eye test' with two rookie linemen and is a whole lot better then people give them credit for. 0 sacks against houston and only 3(?) hurries anyone?. 

Further, our young offence consists of:

- Mike Evans - No argument here for old stonehands, great player. 
- Martin - No argument. Hope he stays but could be gone if we get stingy
- Charles Sims - Good third down back, had to line up in the slot often due to injuries (see list below)
- Cameron Brate - our 2nd/3rd string TE, was clutch when we needed him, but unfortunately wasn't often or was used in blocking.
- ASJ - injured half the season.
- VJax - injured half the season, likely last year next year.
- Kenny Bell - injured whole season.
- Adam Humphries - UDFA WR who was good enough to probably stay next year.
- Donte Dye - UDFA (i think) was serviceable, will likely be cut this offseason. 
 - I know I'm missing some injured Wide Outs, but beer has made me forgetful. 

I do agree with you however that Gurley needed to carry that offence to a degree. But Jameis' season was nothing to sniff at, matched highest TDs in a game by a rookie, 3rd or 4th on total yards by a Rookie. I think there was a little carry there aswell ;). Also won games that were not lost by our porous defence.

"Shameless plug here, but [Super Bowl XXV's halftime show was, by far, the worst](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3zo96n/jaguargator9s_history_of_halftime_day_9_super/)

Do you like awful choreography performed by 5 year olds?

Do you like hearing ""it's a small world"" three times in one show?

Do you like hearing a message from George H.W. Bush in the middle of the show?

Then boy, do I have the halftime show for you!

EDIT: Obligatory honorable mention goes to the following shows-

- Super Bowl XIX, for connecting an already confusing world of children's dreams to the importance of protecting and serving the country

- Super Bowl XX, where Up with People butchers songs from the 80s, and the show is stopped every minute because the songs somehow tie in with the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (because ""The Power of Love"" has a lot to do with the Civil Rights Movement)

- Super Bowl XXIII, with Elvis Presto's magic trick. The Elvis impersonator performed more songs from Grease than he did from Elvis

- Super Bowl XXIX, where the entire show is literally an advertisement for the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland. I'm reviewing that tomorrow for the History of Halftime series, and it's a special kind of bad

- From 2000-present, Super Bowl XL with the Rolling Stones. They only perform 3 songs, Mick Jagger sounds drunk, he pauses to interact with the crowd, and one of the songs that the Stones perform is a brand new song called ""Rough Justice."" With that discography and catalogue, they really wasted their time up there

- And, of course, Super Bowl XLV was pretty bad. Nothing went right that halftime show. That was the day that the Black Eyed Peas literally went from the hottest act in the world to irrelevant.

If you want to see my thoughts on all of the halftime shows in NFL history, I'm currently doing a series right now called the History of Halftime. I'm up to Super Bowl XXVII right now (the incredible Michael Jackson one).

I hate how everyone praises him for leading comebacks from huge deficits but if he didn't throw 4 picks in the first place they wouldn't be in that position. As someone who has watched most of his games, I think that Luck, although a good QB, is massively overrated. but all of these reasons for hatred could easily be attributed to the media and the fans.

&gt; SUMMARY: With the Ravens leading 34-31 with four seconds left in Super Bowl XLVII and readying themselves for a free kick after taking a deliberate safety, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco was heard telling teammates to come off the sideline and tackle 49ers' returner Ted Ginn Jr., if need be.

&gt;Flacco, who was one of many players wearing a microphone for NFL Films, told teammates Dennis Pitta and Matt Birk on the sideline that they couldn't let Ginn run free. ""If he starts to break it, go tackle him,"" Flacco told Pitta.

&gt;The bold and ridiculously unsportsmanlike plan, though never implemented, would not have likely worked since, according to Rule 12, Section 3, Article 3 in the NFL Rule Book: Palpably Unfair Act. ""A player or substitute shall not interfere with play by any act which is palpably unfair. Penalty: For a palpably unfair act: Offender may be disqualified. The Referee, after consulting his crew, enforces any such distance penalty as they consider equitable and irrespective of any other specified code penalty. The Referee may award a score.""

"Ok this is going to get buried but wanted to comment for fun to collect my thoughts and see if I end up right. Been following this saga since last year and this is my best guess how it'll break down.

First, the primary reason this is a clusterfuck is no one is going to get what they want. Fans of one or two of three cities will lose their team. At least one of three owners won't get a new stadium and LA. If the owners could pick the two teams to move they would pick the Rams and Raiders 100% (the Chargers make no sense to move to LA), but the problem is the two most aggressive suitors in the race are the Chargers and the Rams.

Let's start with the Raiders. They have a history of being in LA for nearly a decade and still have a strong fanbase in the area. Something about the team clearly resonated with region is why they are still enormously popular in LA. The issue with them is their owner Davis has been the most wishy-washy of the three about a move. He clearly tagged on as second fiddle to the Chargers Carson bid, and, as another user noted, the owners have to be nervous about trusting a billion dollar franchise and major project to Davis. The current o.Co situation in Oakland for the team is still a bad one, which is one element pushing for a move, but because there is less urgency from the team itself the owners might be more likely to resolve their issues down the road. 

Chargers are the team causing the most headaches, since I think the majority of NFL owners would support a Rams/Raiders move. Spanos has come out super aggressive from the start though, building his own voter bloc from the owners and pushing for an LA move (even though theres no natural Chargers fanbase in LA like there is for the Rams and Raiders). The key element to me is the Chargers have burnt nearly all their bridges with San Diego, and of the three teams they would have the hardest time crawling back if they lost (with the Raiders having the easiest time). I think Spanos is going to find some way to get a deal done because he has to. The issue is he doesn't have the money or vision to build the sort of football mecca the majority of the owners want in LA. 

That's where the Rams come in. Silent Stan is rich enough to fund an entire stadium on his own and move the team calling the NFL's bluff to stop him. His Inglewood plans are exactly the grandiose sort of vision the NFL wants for it's new flagship location and he would have already won enough support if it wasn't for two things. One, Spanos, who has a personal grudge against Stan, blocking him with his own voter bloc, and two, St. Louis being the only of the three jilted cities to come up with a viable plan for a new stadium. Spanos has made it very clearly he won't come to Stan as a beggar (aka renter) to the Inglewood site, and St. Louis looks serious about keeping a team in city. 

So we have gridlock. Three teams, none with enough votes right now to get it approved. Stan still has the most leverage because he's the only one with enough deep pockets to risk making a move without league approval, but the St. Louis and Spanos situation means he won't do it unless he has no other choice.

So here are my three predictions on how it plays out, from most likely to least:

1. Ram/Chargers in Inglewood. The Grand Compromise is the most likely in my view because it would move the two most aggressive parties. The first thing the LA Committee is going to make all the parties do is go through arbitration and see if they can settle it on their own. Ideas will be brandied about, and one will likely be for Stan to sell part of his interest to the Inglewood property (which he owns outright) to Spanos for fairmarket price. This will be a requirement, as there is no way Spanos will agree to just be a tenant to the stadium. Stan will not like it, but it seems like his primary interest in the venture isn't even the stadium itself, it's the properties he would develop around it. There is a chance a compromise could be reached if he sold 50% of the interest in the stadium itself, and 20-30% of the interest to the remaining surrounding properties to Spanos. I know there is bad blood between the two, but as a lawyer it never ceases to amaze me how much money can talk to two professional businessmen at the end of the day. 

2. No compromise is reached, Stan doesn't move. Bad blood between Chargers and Rams is too much, no deal is reached, no one has the votes. NFL calls out Stans bluff and he doesn't move the team, and all three go back to the drawing board for another season. This is a result the NFL doesn't want, but one it's willing to accept to wait another year and see how things play out with Stan having to rehash it with St. Louis and Spanos returning to an angry San Diego. 

3. No compromise reached, Stan moves anyway. I think this is the least likely of the three to happen, but it could. Deadline passes without enough votes for anyone. Stan breaks ground on his stadium proposal, packs up the moving vans overnight, and rents out the Coliseum for two years. The NFL would fine the shit out of him, but they couldn't stop the move if he could pay for it out of hand. My guess is at that point either the Raiders or Chargers would concede defeat and try to work with him to be a partner in the venture (with the Raiders being more likely). The losing team, most likely the still angry Spanos, might actually consider moving to St. Louis with their very attractive stadium themselves. Either way I think St. Louis remains in line for a team in the near future. ",248

In SF he showed signs when Kap was playing well, but when Kap regressed Crab disappeared and it's more Kap's fault than Crabtree's.  Now he has a QB who is willing to give him a chance to fight for the ball, and he's winning the battle.

"&gt; Here’s a list of all the offensive linemen the Patriots have drafted in the first three rounds since 2006:

&gt; 1. Nate Solder, 1st round, 2011
&gt; 2. Sebastian Vollmer, 2nd round, 2009

&gt; That’s it.

&gt; And that's not enough.

And here's the full list of linemen taken by the Patriots in the first three rounds under Bill Belichick:

Solder, Vollmer, Mankins (2005-1-32), Nick Kazcur (2005-3-100), Matt Light (2001-2-48), Adrian Klemm (2000-2-46).

No one was complaining about this in previous when the Patriots were starting undrafted guys like Dan Connolly and Stephen Neal and Joe Andruzzi, or low-round picks like Dan Koppen and Russ Hochstein and Bryan Stork.  The issue isn't where and when they're drafting guys, the issue is that the guys that they have stunk regardless of their draft class.

[Here's the play.](http://a.video.nfl.com/films/2015/NFL_NOW/in-game-highlight/NFL_NOW/REG/7/151025_nfl_ghl_nyj_vs_ne_brady_to_chandler_26_yards_326529_2000k.mp4)

I don't know if someone missed an audible but both danny and gronk looked confused...so I doubt they screwed up the original formation. 

Whether is was a missed audible or not, here's what happened:

Brady recognized a 7-man blitz and knew he only had 6 guys to block (5 linemen plus his RB). He knew he needed some more time to let the WRs and/or chandler get down the field and run his route. 

So he changes the formation: he brought Gronk in to block (notice Brady tells gronk the snap count, ""Gold 80"", and Flemming (the right tackle), points out Gronk's blocking assignment). He tells Amendola to get on the line to make the sure the formation is legal and gronk can go in motion to get to the line to block.  

Understand what just happened. The Jets had the correct personnel and called the correct play/blitz  for the situation (but for Brady's adjustment, they would have had a free rusher). Brady diagnoses the defense, recognizes he needs another blocker, recognizes who will be open/mismatched and makes all those adjustments at the line within the span of about 10 seconds.


EDIT: Thanks to /u/hawkegg (down below). According to belichick's break down, it appears they (maybe) missed a protection change and brady was directing who needed to do what.

All I ask is that if they draft a guy, stand behind him. Don't undercut him by signing Mallet or the like to play in front of him. Play your draft pick. Let him learn and develop. Give him at least 3 years of starting to come around.

Yet, for some reason, the Raiders hired him as their offensive coordinator in 2006. Spoiler alert: It didn't work out. Walsh stated that Randy Moss' skills were diminishing (and one year later, Walsh was proven wrong when Moss broke the single season record for TD receptions in a season). He coached 1 year with Oakland in 2006, and that was it.

"""January 31, 1993 was the first, and last, Super Bowl I ever watched. How do I remember the date? It also happened to be last time I ever talked to my father. Growing up I was a little different, I wasn't interested in sports like the other boys were. I would rather play dolls with my sisters than play catch out back with my old man. Most Sundays I would spend reading romance novels or making outfits out of some old drapes I found in the attic, so at some point in my childhood, my father stopped asking if I wanted to sit down and watch the game with him. He always knew I was different and by the time college rolled around we barely spoke at all. I still remained close to my mother, we talked on the phone at least once a week and I would tell her about the new man I met at university. By the early 90's, her health had declined and she knew she didn't have much time left. In January 1993 she knew she knew it wouldn't be long. They were having a Super Bowl party that year, as they always did. She asked if I would come and to bring Steven with me so she could meet him and see how happy we made each other. So for the first time in years I saw my father, who thought Steven was just a friend. That is, until Don Beebe chased down Leon Lett, stopping him from scoring a touchdown. Now, at that point the game was already over, but Steven, a lifelong Bills fan, got so excited, he jumped up and kissed me right on the lips. My father winced and fell silent. He didn't say another word the rest of the game. Steven and I got ready to leave and Steven walked over to my father, stuck out his hand, and said ""It was nice to meet you, sir."".

off-season the Vikings measured players for body fat. Culpepper's result was somewhere between 7% and 8%. In high school he competed on the weightlifting team. He was also a highly touted

"The opening play of the game is a botched snap to Wilson that ends up in a Broncos safety. Russell falls to his knees in the San Francisco rain and yells out to the hevens ""Maaaaaaax Uuuuuunger!!!""  lamenting his lost Center. Peyton Fucking Manning then goes on a tear, throwing 7 straight 80 yard touchdown passes in a row to Bebe, Sanders, Vernon Davis, Von Miller, Aqib Talib, CJ Anderson and a freshly re-signed and drunk Matt Prater. How you ask? The Broncos onside kick and recover after each touchdown, so the Seahawks never see the ball again before the half. Broncos lead 51-0.

During halftime, Russel Wilson does a beer bong of recovery water while fucking Ciara with all other members of the Seahawks and Pete Carroll watching. Peyton brings Papa Johns to the Broncos locker room. While this is happening, the singer of Coldplay has a wardrobe malfunction, after Beyoncé rips off his pants at the end of the song.

After the half, the Seahawks are unstoppable. Marshawn Lynch has 99 yard touchdown run with all 11 Broncos defenders literally on his back. He grabs his dick so hard as he dives into the endzone that he causes a 9.3 magnitude earthquake that sinks San Francisco into the Pacific. Good thing the game is in Santa Clara. A glowing Russell Wilson throws 6 touchdown passes, all to a cyborg Jimmy Graham with a new robotic knee, to get the game to 49-51. 

Peyton's 13th interception (all in the 2nd half) sets up Seattle at the 1 yard line with 1 second left in the game, down by 2 points. Surely they run it in with Lynch this time, right? Right. Wilson hands off to Lynch who easily breaks the plane, BUT WHAT IS THIS?!?! Play action, bitches. Wilson keeps the ball and throws it to Richard Sherman who is in at wide receiver, but the pass is intercepted by Peyton Manning who is in at cornerback. Peyton gallops all the way to the endzone to win the game 57-49.

After the game, Manning suplexes Erin Andrews before screaming into the camera to never test him with a sorry receiver like Sherman. He then sings *""Getting revenge tastes so sweet.""* before dropping dead due to complications from stem cell and HGH treatments. John Elway neighs in approval.",124

"Tonight was a spectacle. It was the quintessential boiling point on a national stage that exposed to the whole country the state of this team and what our real negative is. People always talk in the media about how good we are but why we can't make the next step. There will be no more questions after this performance.

Marvin's sole duty at this point is managing our personnel and keeping the guys in line. When you hit the jackpot of coordinators for 5 straight years with Zimmer, Gruden, Guenther and Jackson it takes a lot of pressure off the top guy. He didn't need to focus on scheme or playcalling when you have top tier coaches under you. And for a long time we have benefited from this substantially.

Top level coaches establish dominance and control over the players. They are coach first, friend second. They aren't afraid of hurting egos or having guys get mad at them for disciplinary action when someone makes mistakes. Belichick is an obvious example. Like Marvin he is willing to take in risky players with history but he gives them a very short lease. They can barely be within yards of a ref before Bill freaks out and makes sure they don't say a word. Marvin is just frozen on the sideline as he allows our personnel to antagonize refs and opponents until the point of penalty. It is absolutely neglectful on his part, especially considering that this is not a one game isolated incident. Our immaturity has been a critical variable in games for years now. Tonight was just a very harsh realization of this problem.

I don't see how this team recovers from this unless we get a new leader as the top guy in the locker room. Want to promote Marvin to GM? Fine. I don't have a problem with it. But we absolutely need a guy with top authority on the sideline who isn't afraid to step in and hurt the feelings of the guys who work under him. ",377

It's a completely different thing knowing that an injured starter won't be able to play during the week leading up to the game so you could prepare.

"About-to-be-MD; my wife just asked me this question so here's what I told her: 

It could be a very small primary tumor that metastasizes. Stage IV has nothing to do with tumor size, it's all about distant metastasis. You could have a slow-growing, but very malignant tumor. For most cancers (throat included), Stages I and II are based on size in situ. III is based on local invasion (direct spread into nearby tissues, or the lymph system, for some cancers). 

Then no matter what the size, you get upgraded to IV if it metastasizes, i.e. sends a colony or colonies of tumor to somewhere anatomically outside the confines of the throat--lymph system (for some cancers), bone, lung, liver, brain etc. 

Theoretically any cancer can go from undetectable/Stage 0 to Stage IV--essentially ""skipping"" I, II, and II--without growing to significant size, as long as it sends a metastasis to somewhere remote from the original tumor location. 

Now I don't know what Mortensen's initial presentation was, but a plausible, though exceedingly rare, scenario for something like this would be a patient complaining of vague bone pain in his legs and easy bruising. He goes in for an x-ray and his long bones look pockmarked. A biopsy  then shows throat cancer cells in the bones. Stage IV throat cancer, without even feeling any symptoms in the neck. ",188

I've probably told this story before, but my family had season tickets back in the 90's.

My mom was out to dinner that week, and D'Marco Farr actually walked up to her in a restaurant and said that he missed us at the game and he'd hope we'd be there next week.

He almost never seems to drop the football either.

In the AFCCG one of the most impressive catches of the game was when Manning underthrew Sanders up the sideline and that ball was on a direct course for Malcom Butler's hands until Sanders leaped *over* him from behind, reached across the guy's helmet with both hands and plucked the ball away.

But right now, I could still be playing baseball.”

Yet the responses to both are completely different. Fans were calling Amendola dirty and wondering what the fuck he was thinking, a few were hoping the Chiefs went for his legs. Meanwhile, Fitzgerald does it, I saw a few calls of dirty play, but it was mostly about how weak the call is and how the NFL doesn't let players play anymore.

Also, when the team opened up this season with NFL writers projecting them to ride at the bottom of the division it put a little bigger chip on the team's shoulder.  

The organization still has some issues to work through as it relates to the community itself, but Mike Bidwill, BA and Keim have done a TON to put this team on the right path.  Nothing would be better for the future of sports in Az right now than a Cardinals Superbowl victory.  We're conditioned to be pessimistic, but we are as hopeful as we have ever been.

Unless it can be shown that Kroenke was negotiating in bad faith (which is a very high bar to hit) I can't see how the courts could find any of the PR-speak during the process illegally deceptive.

What's more interesting is that there's a second lawsuit from [PSL holders](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/personal-seat-license-holders-sue-rams/article_0d6e239f-639a-5d95-b20e-14e514e074e9.html) alleging that the PSL agreements guarantee the licenses would stay valid until 2025 with no relocation clause, but the Rams are refusing to transfer or refund the PSL's.

"God no. I like 4 preseason games, it's where you find your studs. If there were only 2 preseason games, Russell Wilson, Doug Baldwin, and possibly even Richard Sherman wouldn't be where they are.

Russell Wilson won the job with the 3rd preseason game because Flynn had an arm injury and couldn't go and Wilson impressed. Doug Baldwin won his spot through the preseason game with kick-off returns. Actually now that I think about it, so did Kerease.

Cutting 2 preseason games makes it harder for guys to make the team. You have to see preseason as a job interview, the 1st string players don't matter, it's the 2nd, 3rd, 4th stringer who are fighting for a job. Thomas Rawls played this year because he dominated the preseason. It's a time to watch your team and see what depth they have.

Gonna take a shot in the dark here and say you're not too upset,112
"**26.)  Seattle Seahawks**

**Eli Apple, CB, Ohio St.

The next two guys to come off the board would also be worth considering, because age is now a concern on the interior of that defensive line, but a long, physical cornerback who is a fearless tackler is a great fit for Pete Carroll. Yes, the secondary is a strength in Seattle, but it's impossible to have too many corners who can play, and one injury changes the depth equation in a heartbeat.


**27.)  Green Bay Packers**

*Austin Johnson, DT, Penn St.

Other guys got more of the attention on the defensive line for the Nittany Lions, but Johnson is the top prospect. Green Bay heads into an offseason where B.J. Raji will become an unrestricted free agent and turns 30 this summer. Some youthful talent on the interior of the line would be a good thing, and Johnson fits the bill.


**28.)  Kansas City Chiefs**

*Kenny Clark, DT, UCLA

Clark is a powerful defensive tackle who can hold the point against a double team and keep linebackers roaming free, but will also flash some explosiveness and make plays in the backfield on his own -- and he can just out-muscle blockers one on one. The Chiefs could use more help for Dontari Poe, who happens to be entering the last year of his current deal in 2016.


**29.)  Denver Broncos**

*Ezekiel Elliott, RB, Ohio St.

There's a good chance the Broncos will evolve into a team that truly wants to win with the run game in 2016, and while they do have some options on the roster, Elliott isn't just a great fit, he's also the best player on the board at this point. He has vision, runs behind his pads, can turn a small crease into a big gain, catches the ball with ease, and is one of the best blocking tailbacks I've ever seen.


**30.)  Arizona Cardinals**

*Leonard Floyd, OLB, Georgia

The Cardinals could use another pass-rusher, and Floyd has the explosiveness to be a special one. He has a lean frame, but he can get tackles off balance and is the kind of edge defender that can get quarterbacks to speed up their internal clock. I'd like to see him play a little more physical, but on a good team that is trying to protect leads, Floyd can help.


**31.)  Carolina Panthers**

*Emmanuel Ogbah, DE, Oklahoma St.

For a physical freak who has improved in each year at Oklahoma State, this slot may look WAY too low in a couple of months. Ogbah is an awesome size/quickness combination and can also play a power game and push blockers backward. He's also shown he can play in space a little bit. He's be a great get this far down the board.",112

All I get when I took at Tom Brady is happiness. He reminds me of all the fun I've had watching him lead my team to success over the years. I think back on the years when I was in college and he won his first three Super Bowls. It was so exciting to see the Pats finally get that trophy. I know there were plenty of other players along the years who have played major roles in contributing to the Patriots success, and I appreciate them all. It makes me happy to see Rodney every Sunday night, and I love it when Tedy goes on ESPN, but it's not the same as Tom.

When I see Tom I get butterflies. It's like being back in junior high school when I first realized what it felt like to have a crush on a girl.

"Well I'm a Giants fan and not a 49ers fan...but we have to have some context on this.

The Joe Montana Steve Young thing had been brewing since at least 1987. That year the 49ers had the best record in football and completely flopped against the Vikings in the playoffs. The 49ers actually benched Montana for Young in that game.

In 1988 the 49ers had a mediocre(by their standards) regular season and people were wondering if Young or Montana was going to be the guy. The 49ers ultimately stuck with Montana and won the Sb.

In 1989-1990 season Montana put Young in the rear view winning another Super Bowl and league mvp awards. However, in the 1990 NFC championship game Montana got knocked out and Young filled in for him.

Montana requiring surgery would miss the entire 1991 season and Young would use that season to secure the job. 

Joe Montana was the backup in the 1992 season as Young would win the MVP award. Montana finally asked to be traded and it was granted.

It was hard for many to keep an older and injury prone Montana while Young was the league MVP. However, the 49ers losses to the Cowboys in the playoffs in 92 and 93 caused many fans to miss Joe Cool.

So my impression because of the circumstances...most 49ers knew Steve needed to be the guy. But he was never accepted until they won the 94 championship. And there was probably a small minority of fans...who feel Steve never accomplished all he could as a 49er as opposed to Joe.",260

1) He seems cocky and arrogant when he's winning and winy and annoying when he's not.

2) Uggs

3) He's the opposite of Peyton Manning. Peyton feels like my blue collar uncle. Brady feels like a spoiled coastal kid. Peyton married his college sweetheart, Brady dumped his pregnant girlfriend for a super model. I feel like I could go fishing with Peyton and I'd need an invite to the yact club to hang with Brady. Peyton feels every man, Brady feels snooty.

And yes, I know these feelings are contrived instead of grounded in reality.

4) He's into a lot of wacky, hippy dippy bullshit and pseudoscience. I can't stand that stuff or most of the people I've met who are into it.

5) He supports Donald Trump, and fuck everything about him and the mockery he's making out of our beautiful tradition of democracy.

6) He manages in interviews to feel both smug and totally robotic at the same time.

7) Worst of all, despite all of this, *he's so fucking good*. You can't even rag on the guy because you know he's essentially a football demi-god.

While the unit plays on a string on each level, the occasional lack of discipline and emotional control has resulted in Cincinnati ranking near the top of the NFL in penalties.

"I was 7 when they went to the first Super Bowl.  I still remember it so vividly.  When this first aired my mom and dad watched it and I got an e-mail from my mom saying she really liked it and also reminding me ""I remember a certain little boy who cried himself to sleep that night.""  I'm sure grown men were weeping too.

The support the team and the fans gave to Norwood is so incredibly moving.  I can't imagine another fanbase holding up a player like that.  We can definitely throw a player under the bus, but, I think there's a pretty deep loyalty we do have to our guys.

And the Comeback game is another huge memory for me.  It actually didn't sell out, and so wasn't televised locally.  In the doc they talk about all the people who claim to have been at the game, and most people who claim to have even watched it are lying too (at least Buffalonians).  My grandfather had one of those old-school gigantic satellite dishes in his backyard and could get blacked out games that way.  So, I went to his house and watched every minute of the Comeback.  It's funny, something like that makes you think your team is destined for winning, but yet they couldn't fulfill their destiny.

They also touch on it a bit, but that team was crazy dominant.  Everyone focuses on how they lost, but, to win the AFC for 4 straight seasons is a huge feat, and something to be proud of, even if you have to temper it with the Super Bowl losses.",146
