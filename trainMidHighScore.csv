I had all A's in class (literally), and was pressured multiple times into helping ""friends"" cheat. Only did it once and felt like shit.

To make up for this, I started being a loud mouthed piece of shit, but one very skilled in coming up with witty insults, so people stopped bugging me. Then, as high school progressed, I simply disappeared into the background and just cruised along, acing tests and not bothering anyone.

Meanwhile, students see the artificially low admissions rate and react by applying to more schools--wow! only 20% get in! I better apply to 15 nearly identical schools just to be safe! Now, the college has to start building state of the art luxury dorms and recreation facilities and invest in ""innovative"" learning experiences to make sure they stand out from the other 14 schools to insure that the students they actually want to recruit come to their school so their average SAT scores stay high.

I was told I needed to call at least 300 people a day that has either signed up for his free live seminar or that have called in and shown interest. Each person needed to be contacted at least 3 times in the week leading up to the event. The thing is when they didn't answer their name was passed to the person sitting right niece you on your team. It was common that if someone was at work and didn't answer then they would have at least 8-10 voicemails a day for the week leading up to the event.

""What?""

""Yeah, I'm kinda seeing someone..'

Um, what the fuck? She was still living with me, and as far as I know everything was going pretty damn good.

I found out she was 'seeing' a 49 year old man over the internet. I tried talking to her about everything, and she said she couldn't help it, she was in love. Also, he was rich. She said I couldn't support us. I was making over $8k a month at that time..

Well, I was devastated and instantly kicked her out. She was homeless for 4 days before he arranged for a flight to get her to the middle of bumfuck nowhere, USA. She got there and phoned me probably 20 times a day for three days. I finally picked up once and she was hysterical. She said he lied about his age, and about his two 'businesses.'

He told her he was 49, he was actually 52. He told her he owned a fleet of semi trucks for his transportation company, and that he also worked with technology. It turns out he just washed trucks and totes at a local company, and he fixed computers for $50 a pop a couple times a week.

I laughed at her and told it was what she wanted. She contacted me again and said she was so sorry, and needed help, she wanted to come back, etc. I bought her a flight back and wasn't there to meet her at the airport. I didn't want her back, but I pretended I did just to get her there. I flew her there just to abandon her, the way she did me. She was homeless again in Toronto, as I wouldn't let her stay at my place and wouldn't give her money. The last I heard, she went back to mr. pedophile in Bumfuck USA. She's 19, he's 52.

Was it harsh and childish, yeah, you bet. The worst thing I've done in my life by a mile. But our relationship was so one sided it was ridiculous, I did everything I could for her and then some.

Then after that from what I've seen and was told I talked to of my coworkers into giving me a tandem Beejer on camera. At that point I was completely black out drunk. I got woke up to my cousin flipping out because we left the camcorder hooked up to the tv and it was looping me railing his girlfriend. Then we found all my logo drawings that were like a kindergarten drawing and a business plan.

"I killed my uncle on accident. We (mom, dad, brother, aunt and uncle) were on a boat at the lake and I was 6. Something got caught in the engine so my uncle stopped the boat and he and my dad jumped down to fix it. I was six so my attention to what was happening was non existent. My uncle left my keys in the igniton and I walked over and turned the engine on because I wanted to drive and because he said I could earlier that day but changed his mind. My dad lost two fingers and my uncle got hit in the chest and neck. I could still hear his screams and his attempts to breath back on the boat. A nearby boat saw us and tried to get him to the doctor but he had no chance. My entire family pretty much disowned me from that point on. My grandparents won't see me and the only one who cares is my mom. My parents got divorced soon after because my mom wouldn't get rid of me. I haven't seen my dad in 13 years and my brother who was older than me at the time still comes around. ",441

"The problem isn't that the first games are at all bad, they're not, they're pretty darn solid Game Boy RPG's. The issue is that they have some flaws, only some of which come from space restrictions in the console. Take for example the way items are stored. You can only hold so many types of item on you, because of the way the memory is written. Which means you need to keep an eye on your inventory. Which in a turn based RPG seems nonsensical. Not only that, but the storage system for items you're not carrying also has a limit in size, meaning that you need to be aware of what space you have.

Other problems in terms of gameplay are things that looking back seem obvious, but at the time weren't. Having to go into a menu every time you wanted to surf, for example, doesn't seem like a problem, until you play the sequels and get used to being able to just press one button on the coast. Suddenly going back, you can see that navigating the menu's to do the same thing feels very archaic and impractical, but the truth is it was a limitation players at the time accepted. 

Whether or not older designs are better or worse than newer designs are personal preference. There's no denying however that some designs in all generations are good and bad. [Voltorb](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/d/da/100Voltorb.png/250px-100Voltorb.png), for example, is a very lazy design, while [Buneary](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/a/a7/427Buneary.png/250px-427Buneary.png) from Gen 4 doesn't look out of place next to other Gen 1 Pokémon. What isn't up for debate however is that [the sprite work for Gen 1](http://orig04.deviantart.net/3e75/f/2012/296/0/e/pokemon_green___red_blue_comparison_sprite_sheet_by_fimxscootaloo-d5iqjvd.jpg) is terrible (so much so that in Japan, they initially released Red &amp; Green, then later released Blue as a graphical improvement, before releasing Yellow as an updated version).

There are other issues of course, infamous bugs such as Missingno and Glitch City, but you really have to go out of your way to trigger either of those, so it's really not something most people would encounter. There are some other bugs that are an actual issue, Ghost is supposed to be immune to psychic, but a programing bug makes them weak to psychic, and the lack of split between Special Attack and Special Defence allow Psychics a lot of attack power. Furthermore, Psychics are only weak to Ghost, and Bug, neither of which have any real good attacks. The AI is also a bit dim in places, but again this is more of a technical limitation than anything else. 

But if you can overlook the bad art, and can accept the technical limitations, they do still stand up. The core gameplay still holds together, the story is still enjoyable, and the variety of locations to explore still make it entertaining. It may lack the length and complexity of it's sequels, but because there's less to do it actually feels more likely that the game can be fully beaten. In recent titles, the task of catching all 700+ mons feel impossible, but when the number is the low 151 it doesn't feel like such an impossible task. ",479

People applaud him for the ipod and iphone but seem to miss the fact that those devices pushed the tech industry. If Steve Jobs wasn't there, we would probably be behind a couple of years compared to today on the power of the tech in the market.   
He didn't bring out some hybrid device that would have been cheaper to R&amp;D and make, but he went all out. Everything had to be perfect. That's why Nokia failed. Their approach was to use what they had to give the same experience, which failed miserably, cause apple was so far ahead.   
Elon Musk is doing something similar with cars and space travel. The auto industry is(was) standardized on IC engines. Any of them could have developed the same tech that Tesla did, but didn't want to lose what they have made for decades. Why put in so much money in R&amp;D to develop something that would only compete against what we have been making for cheaper for years. Even Elon is hard on his employees. He pushes them to the bone too.

-realizing that I find drinking appropriate at any time of day, in any situation, with or without company, for any or no reason at all

-that time I drunk wrecked my car (this was years ago - I DO NOT drive when I've had anything to drink anymore)

-every time my roommate has had to tell me who I ~~pinned against the wall and made out~~ hooked up with the other night because I was blackout drunk (this was frighteningly common for a while)

-any time that I've tried to limit myself to two drinks, and have had at least 12

-that time I casually face planted in a driveway and had a black eye for a while

-when I noticed that going without cigarettes for a day did much, much less to me physically than going without alcohol... I get nauseated, weak, shaky, have migraines and mood swings if I go more than a day without

-""road beers"" became the norm, and it was almost unacceptable to be in a car without one (this was in my ranch life days - nowhere near civilization/traffic)

-when I couldn't commit to a 3-4 hour social event with very close friends, because I wouldn't be allowed to drink there

And on top of that, there seems to be a bit of social pride around that. I've heard so many people say things like ""why should I have to pay for someone else who won't pay their bills?""

"I used to work at a major retail store. One day I found a random SD card on the ground outside the entrance doors. I decided to take it home to see if there was anything on it. There were hundreds of pictures that a family had taken. Vacations, their kids, stuff like that.  I used context clues in the pictures to find out where the kids went to school and other identifying information, called the school, they knew the family I was talking about, so I dropped the SD card off at the school so they could give it back to the family.

Not really that great or anything, but it was the first thing I thought of and the family was very appreciative.",127

"He was the smelly kid. I never sat next to him or really ever interacted with him too much, but people always said he stank like shit. 

Apparently, in primary school, he went to the bathroom, missed shitting into the toilet and it hit the floor. He then picked it up and spread it around the toilet. I don't know if this is true, because I wasn't in their school, but about twenty guys all said it was true, and girls in the girls school confirmed it (it was a mixed primary school, then we went to same sex secondary schools, I was always in all boys schools).

I do know for a fact that this guy did something that makes me laugh to this day. He wanted to be ""cool"" so he bought some weed. And by weed I mean a guy sold him catnip.

He told us all he was going to smoke it in school, during break. He sat out on the field and lit up. He didn't know it, but everyone knew it was catnip and he didn't understand why everyone was laughing so hard. He eventually found out and was mortified, extremely angry and demanded he get his money back. Didn't happen.

"I worked at a private tennis club one summer in university. About 90% of my job was maintaining the courts, and the rest was doing various other tasks as needed. One minor task was picking up the used towels from the women's changing room and throwing them into the laundry, since I was the only female staff member other than the waitresses.

One day I was walking through the changing room and it was VERY busy and crowded. A lot of these ladies just used the towel and dropped it on the floor where they stood instead of putting them in the laundry baskets. I already thought this was incredibly rude/oblivious. Not only do I have to carry your used, wet towels ... I have to go around picking them up one at a time off the floor like some Elizabethan maid, and I have to do it IN FRONT of everyone as they stand around staring like they have no idea why I'm there. Presumably they think the towels are sentient and can walk themselves to the laundry. But whatever - there are far worse things in life. I just tried not to catch any glimpses of the often corpulent women who seemed to enjoy striding around being imperious in the nude talking about firing their Filipina maid for missing a spot on the windows.

However, this particular day as I wound my way through the area with a huge stack of towels in my arms towards the back door (staff entrance/exit), this little fat old woman snaps her fingers without even making eye contact and just says ""YOU. Do something about the heat in here - it's FAR too hot."" For a moment, I wasn't sure she was speaking to me... I paused, said ""I'm sorry, were you speaking to me?"" ""I SAID TURN OFF THE HEAT."" So I put the towels down, said ""Well, in future my name is [Name] if you need to get my attention, and the space heater is guest-controlled."" so I leaned over her and flicked the off switch of the heater which was right next to her. There were a few of these things installed around the changing rooms to allow people to get a little extra blast of heat on chilly days while they were getting dressed. It would be like telling a staff member to turn off a hairdryer you were holding in your hand, or turn off a tap you'd just turned on to wash your hands.

This kind of behaviour happened CONSTANTLY - people were just unbelievably rude and entitled, and the funny thing was that they were all nouveau riche plonkers with zero class/upbringing. Major case of overcompensating for their (in their own mind) inadequate origins. My family is upper middle class thanks to a few generations of very hard work, and I can safely say that my grandparents were attending balls in eveningwear when these people's antecedents were illiterate farm labourers. I think that's what got me through the job without feeling bitter or resentful - I found it hilarious to see how puffed up and pompous they were, so impressed with themselves and so convinced that everyone else was too.

The richest woman in the club, on the other hand, comes from old and MUCH more substantial money. Let's just say that if I named the family, everyone would have heard of them, even non-Canadians. She used to show up to play tennis dripping in dazzling diamond rings/bracelets/earrings. She saw me hauling recycling bins two at a time (there were probably 20 or so) from the road up the very very very long path to the club entrance one morning at about 6:30. She shouted good morning with a big smile and grabbed two of the wheelie bins and dragged them up on her way in. She has nothing to prove, unlike the horrible woman in the changing room, and she was always super nice to any staff.

"Destroyed a Christian family's prized art of Jesus and stole their forbidden fruit

Well, 2 years ago, I was invited over to my now ex-girlfriend's house for dinner. After the 4 months we were dating, this would be the first time meeting her parents. Unfortunately, they and my ex-girlfriend were a strict Christian family. But since she was one of the best and most beautiful girls I've ever meant, I decided that she would be worth pursuing despite the Christian background. Putting the best facade I had (Since I'm an atheist), I drove to their house putting on my good boy, christian face. First thing that I saw, was a doormat with the writing ""Jesus died for you and me."" It was then that I knew I was getting in some deep waters. 

After I knocked on the door, her parents greeted me. They seemed normal, like an average white family. But as I entered their house, I underestimated the sheer Jesus in the surrounding rooms. Walls filled pictures of bible scenes. Quotes framed on every wall, pictures of Jesus surprising me in every corner. However, their was a grand 5x3 foot image of Jesus in the kitchen. Her father told me that this was their best painting, costing over $5000 and one of their favorite pieces. My ex-girlfriend greeted me after walking down the stairs and I opened my arms for a hug. To my astonishment, she quickly grabbed my right hand and shook it. Out of the corner of my eye, her Dad glared at me, knowing my intentions to touch more than 4 inches of her body. Sternly, he told me, ""let's eat some dinner OP."" I could only stare at my feet and await the horrors of what they expected.

It was at the dinner table, where they finally broke me. While we prepared to eat dinner, they asked me to began grace before the meal. I was lost. I finally admitted that I was no Christian, but an Atheist. And to my astonishment, they already knew. And then muttered the words I would never forget. ""We are trying to save you my son. Please let us welcome you to our church."" Turns out, the four months with their daughter was a scheme to make me Christian. I lost it. I stood up and kicked over my chair and stormed out of the dinner room. And at the nearest picture with Jesus on it, and grabbed it and smashed it to the floor, crushing a mixture of wood, glass, and Jesus into shreds. After a minute of the terrible destruction, I realized the crime I had done. The grand 5x3 foot image of Jesus giving gifts and performing miracles was now tinder for the fireplace. Her family stared in horror as I not only crushed their lord and savior, their most prized possession. I had to get out. So with my adrenaline stuffed mind, I ran out of the kitchen grabbing the brightest, red apple they had. And while this was one of my most sinful actions, that apple sure was good. 

TLDR I escaped from Jesus, but there were casualties

Edit: Holy, so much hate. I destroyed the picture in a fit of rage, not because I hate Jesus. I hold nothing against any religion. The fact was that they led me on for 4 months which was the reason I broke the picture.",265

The ""one weird trick"" is that you can order a completely custom, one-of-a-kind wedding dress in your exact measurements, with high-quality materials and sewing, for a few hundred dollars.  The trick is to order it directly from China.  Most wedding dresses are originally made in China anyway, and are usually marked up to 10x the price they were originally sold for when they left China.  

Just find a dressmaker (most of them have eBay stores or dedicated websites), and you can send them a request for a completely custom gown.  Go to a bridal store and try on ones you like, taking lots of pictures.  Include detailed descriptions and sketches.  You can imitate a designer gown or have your favorite one made for a fifth of the price.

This could apply to any custom dress; they'll make anything for $200 or $300.",277

Edit: Thanks everyone for the encouragement!  I had no idea there were so many people out there who have had their lives saved by a bone marrow donor.  It makes it all the more important.

"When I was in high school I lost my virginity to a guy that was attractive, charming, funny, and refused to touch me after we had sex. He would be so sweet and into me before the act and then immediately after it was like a switch would turn off. After he came, he would turn over, look at the clock, and ask me when im leaving. It left me feeling so unwanted and unattractive, but in a sick way it made me try that much harder to keep his attention. I learned how to negotiate ""cuddle time"" with him and he would time it. I could get 10 extra minutes in bed with him if I was lucky. He convinced me that all guys were like this and if they weren't, they were probably gay. 


This was only one of many manipulative behaviors he had and it left a big dent in my self-esteem. We continued to have a 5 year relationship  that consumed the best parts of my teen and college years. I was so naive and I spent way too much of my time picking myself apart because of him.

"It's just for show -- no idea how the hosts came to the conclusion who won, but there was no magic machine computing probabilities and algorithms.

I was the lead French Musketeer from Season 2 in the Ming Warrior vs French Musketeer episode. If you search ""French Musketeer, Deadliest Warrior"" in google you'll see lots of photos of my ugly mug.  I'm featured throughout the episode, but the best scenes are in the final fight -- my character is the last man standing.

The whole thing was 2 days of shooting and 1 day of rehearsal over two weeks. The first day was costume fitting and right into promo shots -- lots of posing with the weapons, doing little sword tricks and stuff for the cut scenes where we swing some steel and they run stats on the sidebar.

Day 2 was a rehearsal -- the fight director showed us how he preferred we all sling the steel. We paired up against some Ming actors and just all around had fun. No choreography was taught for the shoot at this rehearsal, it was more them just making sure our skills were up to par and we could follow directions come shoot day.

Day 3 was the shoot. Every piece of fight footage you see in that episode was shot in a single day. We started pre-dawn and wrapped minutes before the sun set. All the fights were taught on the spot -- we had about 20 minutes to practice each fight before the cameras started rolling. 

The hat tip you see in the final fight where my French comrade gets shot in the neck while we're scaling the hill wasn't part of the script, I improved that moment, haha. The final fight between my character and the lead Ming Warrior was the last thing we shot that day, and was also the most stressful. We started choreographing the fight maybe 45 minutes before sundown and had 5 minutes or so of rehearsal before we started filming it. That actor waaaaay outclassed me in skill and I was surprised they didn't have him do cooler stuff. That cliff we were fighting on was high as fuck, too and I remember thinking, ""Fuck me, I'm not union and I don't have health insurance."" 

But we ground it out and at the end of the day that whole episode is my 15 minutes of fame! Absolutely loved doing it, such a blast and everyone on set was super cool to work with. 

LMK if I can help answer anything else!

**EDIT:** Thought of two more things! In the final fight when my character lobs a grenade and it blows up, they use a big ass fucking dirt cannon to give the effect of the explosion. Basically it's a big air gun and they fill it up with dirt and fire it at us, haha. 

There's also a scene where we are lobbing grenades behind a wheelbarrow or something like that. The dirt cannon blasted us a lot there, too, and I remember out of nowhere while shooting that scene a fucking big ass swarm of bees appeared -- I'm talking hundreds of bees -- and we had to book it the fuck out of there.

"The year is 2002. It's late at night and I'm driving to my parents' house that's some way outside the city, basically in the middle of nowhere. A truck cuts me off at an intersection on my way to the highway - I had right of way and would've plowed straight into the truck if I hadn't slammed on the brakes. I honk the horn at him and give him the middle finger (which I doubt he sees) and pass him as we get on the highway.

A little while later I turn off the highway and notice that the same truck turns the same way. The roads are smaller and it's dark, so I'm driving at the speed limit and the truck catches up to me. He's getting uncomfortably close and even though I start speeding up he just gets closer and closer.

When the truck is like three feet from my rear bumper I accelerate as fast as I can and get a couple of hundred yards between us so I can quickly turn at the next intersection. He follows. I hit the accelerator and turn again when the next intersection comes along.

So I'm racing down these country roads that are barely wide enough for the truck and this asshole is keeping up. My heart is beating like crazy. But I also know the area and the roads, and as we get into roads that run through the woods I turn off my headlights, drive like a maniac and manage to turn to an even smaller road without him possibly seeing me take the turn. I can't keep driving because I know the road just goes to a cabin and ends there, so I come to a stop a bit down the road and to the side, so the trees will cover me, and turn off my engine. Then I wait.

After a while I can see his headlights on the road I turned off from. He's driving slower now. He stops at the intersection and shines a flashlight down the road to where I am. He's looking at my direction for what feels like minutes and I hope the flashlight can't reach all the way to where my car is.

Finally he drives away. I wait for five more minutes and then head back to the main road and continue to my parents' house.

"Consequences would potentially suck horribly, but there are upsides.  
  
I'm 26 now, and most of my best friends, I first met and bonded with in middle school and high school. With the mind of a 26 year old, it is unlikely that I would be able to have any meaningful bond/camaraderie with my friends. In this new timeline, it is unlikely that I will make the same friends. Things will be too different, and I realize that when my mind was a middle school mind, I liked and valued these friends, but when my mind is 26 I don't think I'd be able to tolerate my old friends in their younger states in this new timeline. Actually, I'd expect not to have many or any friends until I am in my 20s again.   
  
Since my mind is 26, though, that means I already went through my ""rebellious stage"" and I already learned a lot from the mistakes of my childhood. This time around, it'd be far easier to deal with just doing homework (not even because it's easier, but because I understand motivation and discipline more). I wouldn't get in trouble in school as much this time around, because I wouldn't need to seek validation from friends by acting out. All sorts of little things like this combined would make me a *god* at schoolwork up until and really even into college. I'd be the quiet kid who does great work and always has a nose stuck in some book or whatever. If I do end up making friends that'd be cool - kids are very tolerant of weirdness so maybe it's not hopeless, and while I couldn't have meaningful conversations about a film or novel with the schoolkids around me, I suppose I could talk videogames to them for the most part. 
  
However, I am armed with some knowledge of how the world changes, that I did not know when I was 9. I would be on the lookout for bitcoin, and invest time and money into that as soon as possible and sell as soon as they hit the $800 mark or so (I would want to give some leeway, that isn't the peak price in our normal timeline, but you never know how the new world might change from my expectations simply because I am doing things differently now - slight variation should be expected).  
  
Additionally, I would play different games and watch different movies and read different books. For example, I read Sword of Truth and Wheel of Time books starting in high school, but now that I am returned to 9-yr-old age, I still retain my memories of reading those books at those points in my own past, so there is no point in reading them again. This time, I can do different things. By doing different things, I don't lose what I did in my previous timeline, I simply gain further experiences in this new timeline. For the sake of my sanity, redundancy should be avoided where possible and practical.  
  
I would also go for a different degree in college. While in the new timeline I will lack the credentials of my former degree, I still have whatever educational/intangible benefit it gives me. There's no point in getting the same degree twice unless I am certain that my first timeline degree choice was already optimal.   
  
I would tell no one; they would just be concerned and probably enroll me in therapy. Depending on how crazy they think I am for making outlandish claims, this could be a severe hindrance to my future. It is not unheard of to be a ""wiser than his years"" child and a ""smarter than his years child,"" and I already read a lot of books and was inquisitive in my original timeline anyway, so I'd just stick to that story rather than attempt to convince people that I am actually an adult mind transported from the future into this child's body. One story is plausible, and the other is unbelievable.  
    
The basic goal is to learn new things. I'd play DotA and LoL instead of MMOs (I already spent my whole first childhood and teenage years in MMO games, so this time why not get in on the ground floor of mobas? No matter how productive you try to be with this new life, you're going to need hobbies and leisure time regardless). I'd go for a stem degree instead of an English degree - my first-timeline career ended up being in a stem field regardless, but having the right degree should let me advance faster and better. I'd be ready for bitcoins, knowing when to start farming them and when to start selling them.   
  
Beyond all that, once I reach 26 years old in this new timeline, I should be far better off than I was in this first one, at least financially. Again, the biggest problem is friendships. I think the only meaningful freindships I'd make in the new timeline would be in online games where I could speak adult-to-adult, rather than adult-to-child. My peers wouldn't be found in schools.

Morning 1: Wake up early or get poor sleep as a result of drinking.  Some stomach upset and a headache if I didn't drink enough water.

Night 1: Hard time going to sleep without booze in me.  Brain temporarily forgets how to do it - I just passed out before when I was drinking daily.

Morning 2:  Wake up.  No headache or anything, but tired from lack of sleep the last 2 nights

Night 2:  Don't accomplish anything in the evening because I'm tired from lack of sleep.

Morning 3:  Wake up, often groggy from having slept too much rather than too little

Night 3:  Go to sleep at an appropriate time

Morning 4:  (about 100 hours after the boozing) Back to normal, but still depressed.  Likely my apartment is a mess because I've been too lazy to do dishes or laundry since Morning 1.  Haven't been to the gym in 5 days.  Probably haven't eaten my vegetables.

Night 4:  Clean up my apartment, eat some healthy food, go to sleep at the normal time.

Morning 5:  Wake up, feel like a human being again.

Night 5:  Hit the gym, eat more real food, get some good sleep.

Morning 6:  (1.6% of a year after the initial drinking) wake up feeling good.   However those 5 days off the gym made me have mild DOMs so that sucks.

Night 6:  Normal night

Morning 7:  Feels good man

Night 7:  Hit the gym again, not likely to have DOMs this time.

"This is [the pegasus in question](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/0/05/Derpy_ID_S4E10.png).  She first appeared in the background of the first episode, and gained the fan label Derpy Hooves due to her eyes.  Her popularity skyrocketed and she became sort of a ""Where's Waldo"" for the show, often showing up in obscure or random places in background shots. 

A lot of fans were pretty crazy about her, and she was a popular character in fan fiction (often playing the assistant to the [Doctor Hooves](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/7/71/Dr._Hooves_ID_S05E09.png) pony in fan-fiction, named such for his resemblance to Tennant, and his hourglass cutie mark)

Participating entirely in the background, she was unvoiced, and people had basically decided on a 'fanon' surrounding her wherein she was a bit on the airhead/ditzy side of the personality spectrum.

In season two, episode fourteen, she suddenly appeared in a voiced role, interacting with one of the main characters, Rainbow Dash - and true to fan interpretation, she fucked things up and started off the episode's chain of events.

During this exchange, Rainbow Dash called her by the name 'Derpy'.  It was a huge validation moment for a lot of fans, and people were generally happy and excited about it.

Almost immediately, uproar started with complaints being leveled  because 'Derpy' was an offensive name that was on par with naming a character 'retard'.  It did not help that the voice used wasn't the most flattering of voices.

The episode was delayed from release on iTunes, and when it finally appeared on iTunes, the scene had been edited.  Her name was removed from the dialogue, and animation edits had been made to reduce her cross-eyed nature.  The re-dub also changed her voice significantly.

This was perceived as censorship by many fans and created massive outrage.

Most fans have long since moved past this.  She's been used in many visual gags throughout the last few seasons, and to the shock of basically all of us, actually gained another voiced role in episode 100 - where she was actually one of the primary characters of the episode.  In that episode, her name was never spoken, but she was credited as ""Muffins"", a nod to the fandom belief that she loves muffins.

Official merchandise has refused to name her directly - often using descriptive names instead of proper names (such as the CCG cards, which refer to her as ""Bubbly Mare"", ""Equestrian Mailmare"", ""Muffin Mare"", etc. depending on what she's doing in the card's art).

Almost everyone still calls her Derpy, though.

My personal opinion is that the complaints being filed were the result of some trolls getting people unfamiliar with the show (or the word 'derp', for that matter) to stir shit up.",741

"Finally, a thread I can contribute too. This wasn't me, it happened to my mom, but it's by far the most fucked up thing I've ever heard.

When my mom was in college she worked at a mental hospital for criminally insane minors. People need to be pretty messed up to be sent there, so it's not exactly like ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". Some of the stories my mom told me about that place were just awful.

Probably the worst though was about this one kid. I don't know his actual name (confidentiality reasons) but I'll call him Hank. Hank had severe mental problems. Before he was sent there, he would take home kittens from the humane shelter, and from people giving them out etc. Then Hank would bury them up to there necks in the ground, and run over them with a lawn mower. He also stabbed his sister once. Real serial killer shit.

People weren't allowed to be around him alone, because all of the orderlies at the hospital were terrified of him. He was large enough that only a few of the really big male nurses could even begin to control him. He had tried to strangle and rape one of the female nurses once, but they managed to get him sedated fast enough. She still ended up taking a sick leave because it shook her up so badly.",118

"I used to work at a large national finance company, in collections. We were in San Diego, so we got the early morning shift on the dialer to help cover the east coast. Our shifts started at 6am and 7am. so we were always the first ones in the office (and the night shift was always the last to leave). 

One day, we get in at 6am and our badges won't unlock the doors. Eventually an actual manager shows up, and her key card also won't open the door. By this time, there are close to 200 folks stuck outside the building at 7:30am. The facilities manager shows up and HER key card won't work! A locksmith comes out and tries to drill the manual locks on the front door, but the locks are actually really high quality and the drill can't cut into it. The security company can't remotely open the locks, and it turns out the issue is actually with their system. 

Now, here's the fucked up part. The facilities manager had a set of manual keys that would physically unlock any of the exterior doors to the building. Where were they? In her desk drawer, in her office, in the building. Because you know, she'd never need them to get IN the building!

The alarm company ended up having to restore a backup of the security system, which finally got us into the building at 9:30. Yes, that means about 20 of us had been stuck outside for 3.5 hours. Years later after that facilities manager no longer worked at the company, my boss told me she *almost* got fired for that. She had ONE job to do, dammit!

Edit: 20 people got to work at 6:00am. By 7:30, there were 200 people there. By 9:30, everyone was there, so around 500.",853

"*Grade 6.  Dodgeball game.*

This girl had been flirting with me.  I knew she was flirting because she told me I was weird - obvious infatuation with me.  So I had to impress her, of course.  I did my best to impress her by trying to eliminate her in dodgeball excessively.  Now let me tell you right now - I am the best damn dodgeball player out there.  Impressive throwing accuracy and velocity, mindful strategic play, and most importantly -- the desire to destroy my opponents.  

Needless to say I got her out 3-4 times in a row pretty quickly. I dispatched her teammates on several occasions as well; probably not as ruthlessly as I dispatched her, however.  But I still had to prove my worth to her by eliminating her a few more times.  I grab a ball off the floor and noticde her releasing a throw of her own at one of my teammates.  She was hopelessly oblivious to me.  *What a newb*.  As she releases her throw, I am probably in her peripheral vision...if she was paying any attention, which she wasn't.  Fucking rookies.  Anyways, of course I throw my ball as hard as I possibly can at her.  *A bit too high and a bit too perfect*, my throw dings her right on the jaw.  She crumples to the floor and immediately beings crying.  Her friends rush to her aid and immediately give me the dirtiest glances I've ever been on the receiving end of.  

Her friends help her off the floor and out of the gymnasium.  I was then ostracized by all of the cool girls for the remainder of the year.  

*TL;DR - Dominated some part-timers in dodgeball.  Brilliant headshot should have been rewarded with praise but was instead the reason for my position on the social hierarchy to be downgraded*",192

Which means that if you listen to something in Latin, you always know how it's written even if you don't understand the meaning, because Latin ortography is *phonemic*, it precisely mirrors the spoken sounds. 

So if someone ask their name they don't have to spell it, because there is only one way to write it, nobody would even ask how it's written a name, if not for very special cases, usually foreign names. Or unless it is Japanese where they also have more meanings for the same sound, but that's another problem.

"You should read Judy Garland's wikipedia page (she was a child actress for MGM Studio, she was also Dorothy from Wizard of Oz)

Here's an excerpt from the Early Career section:
""To keep up with the frantic pace of making one film after another, Garland, Rooney, and other young performers were constantly given amphetamines to stay awake, as well as barbiturates to take before going to bed so they could sleep.[28] For Garland, this regular dose of drugs led to addiction and a lifelong struggle, and contributed to her eventual demise. She later resented the hectic schedule and felt that her youth had been stolen by MGM. Though Garland was of a healthy weight, the studio demanded that she diet constantly. They even went so far as to serve her only a bowl of soup and a plate of lettuce when she ordered a regular meal.[29] Despite successful film and recording careers, awards, critical praise, and her ability to fill concert halls worldwide, she was plagued throughout her life with self-doubt and required constant reassurance that she was talented and attractive.""",651
"I hate when people act like they understand communism by saying ""It looks like a great idea on paper, but in practice it just doesn't work."" I've never met someone who said this who could a) give a detailed definition of communism or b) explain why it doesn't work in a way that is unique to communism. They'll usually say ""People are  greedy/self-interested and would take advantage of the system"", as if non-communist systems are free from this flaw.

Edit: I am not saying that there are no valid explanations of the shortcomings of communism. As per the original question, I'm just saying that a lot of people think that its a simple, cliché answer.

"Not me, but a friend of a friend.  I've shared this a couple other places before for similar questions.

I was visiting my buddy down at Ft. Bragg before he got out of the army. We went and grilled out with some of his army buddies, played some bocce ball and drank some beers. One of the guys tells this incredible story about a freaky chick he banged one time. I promise you I will not do it justice and I wish I had it on video, it would be youtube gold. It goes something like this:

""I was living in a drug house at the time, so we got a pretty interesting crowd there. There was this one hot chick that came by one time, and we were all getting high and drunk and shit, and she and I end up making out and going back to her place. Things get hot and heavy, and I start going down on her. I went down on her for what must have been half an hour, before she tells me to go into her closet, to the black duffel bag, and pick out whatever I wanted. I go in there, and there is this HUGE, I'm talking hockey-sized, duffel bag, and inside it is nothing but sex toys. So what do I do, but I pull out the largest, blackest dildo that I can find, and I take it back and start fucking her with it. We're doing this for a while, and then I throw aside the dildo and go at it myself. We're going for a little while, and then she pulls out some razor blades and tells me to cut her. ""Cut me"" she says. ""I can't come if you don't cut me."" I was a bit freaked out by it, but I was pretty fucked up at this time and it was probably the best sex that I had ever had, so I was more open-minded than I might have been had this came out much earlier on. I said fuck it and grabbed one and just did a slash across her stomach. She was on top, and she squirted like crazy. I mean it was just like a rooster tail gushing out and hitting the wall. This was my first time with a squirter, too, so you could say that this was a pretty insane experience. We kept on going and cutting in different positions. Every time I cut her, she'd come and just spray(somewhere in all of this he likened her to Old Faithful). I let her cut me a few times. It was this wet, sticky mess of sex and sweat and blood and cum. It was amazing.""

Again, I'm not doing it justice. I don't remember enough of the details that made it the amazing story that it was. When he was telling it, we were all dying laughing. I figured I should at least share it with the few people that might see it here.",179

Barring that, your only bet is to make a bloody, unrecognizable example out of one, and hope the others are too scared to continue, or more interested in getting their friend to a hospital than fighting you.

"I was 16 and had just started ""dating"" this 23 year old.  Yes, I know, I know, but at the time I thought he just genuinely saw how mature I was.

Anyway, he went out one night with some of his friends, and I couldn't go, because at fucking 16 they wouldn't let me into the bar (imagine that).  He called me at one point to chat and mentioned that there was some guy there that wanted to fight him.  I discouraged this, and shortly after, the call was lost.

In my hormone-addled 16 year old brain, I immediately thought that the guy that wanted to fight him had just attacked him and that HE NEEDED ME RIGHT THEN.  So I tried calling back.  No answer.

I called again.  No answer.

This went on for nearly an hour.  Then I started calling his friends.  No answer there either.

I didn't have a car at the time (I was baaaaarely 16 and hadn't gotten one yet) so I couldn't drive to him.  And no way was my mom gonna let me use her car to go check on my 23 year old boyfriend that she didn't know about.

So I called.  And called and called and called until finally I gave up and went to sleep.

He never called me again, and we only fooled around once more after I called and he (I'm pretty sure mistakenly) answered, and I all but begged to see him.

In my head, I painted him as the asshole, just using me for sex.  But looking back, I'm now 29, and I think I'd be on the verge of calling the police if a guy called me and my friends nonstop all night.  Just a horrible situation all around.",454
