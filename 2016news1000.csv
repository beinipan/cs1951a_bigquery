"Oh it doesn't even matter, SJWs, liberals and BLM will abos-fucking-lutely still criticize them saying stuff like ""The gun was fake!"" (I've seen it happen before with my own eyes. I always wonder; People that delusional have to be on some watchlist) after the facts come out, implying the cop obviously should have stopped to see if it was real and potentially die first so 20 year old liberal arts majors who have no idea how the real world works yet, could feel good about themselves. Or, another liberal buzz word they'll use is the person was ""unarmed"" and it will go right to the front page of Reddit, everyone joking/meme'ing and talking about how cops are out of control. Then you find out the POS was reaching for the cops gun but UNARMED! BUZZ WORDS!

Even still, outside of places like news and worldnews the SJWs try and say that we all are just secretly nazi racists and *that* is why we dislike the BLM movement. Another person in this thread said if someone dies, then things will change but they really wont. Sometime last year, when they did this, as they've done 50 times, there was an ambulance that was occupied as they blocked the highway. The liberal/SJW excuse? ""They have their right to protest!"" which is also their response if you tell them it's okay to protest, just don't do it on the highway. Again, buzzwords.

edit: When I meant ""pay bills a month in advance"" I should have delved further, I do have a form of flexible savings in that I have 5% of each check put into a separate savings account with another bank than my primary savings/checkings, this amount has varied from 5-15% through the past 7 years.

Freedom is Slavery when habeus corpus can be suspended without fanfare, the Patriot Act gets repeatedly renewed, and the masses work for less and less wealth while a small fraction of the population controls most of the resources.

"Automotive journalist here -- just reposting this as a reply to the current top comment so more people will see it.

There's nothing to see here, folks.

This isn't a factory spinning up to build new Deloreans.  All that has happened is that a small company bought the rights to the name, and collected a stockpile of old Delorean parts built in 1981 but never assembled into new cars.

Back in 2007, they announced plans to assemble them into new cars, and their lawyers told them it wouldn't be legal to do so, because the cars wouldn't meet modern safety and emissions standards.

They spent nine years trying to get an exemption.  Now they got it.  The government will allow them to legally assemble the old parts and sell them as complete cars, until they run out of their stockpile of parts. So they issued a press release saying they're going to assemble those old parts into new cars and sell them, if anyone is willing to pay six figures, and they can ""manufacture"" at a rate of maybe 2 cars/year.

They're still shitty cars, but now they want four times the price for one.  They're unlikely to find a lot of buyers, and this doesn't mean there will be 100,000 new, redesigned modern Deloreans for sale soon.  It means there will be 1 or 2 Deloreans built from old parts, every year, for a while, if anyone is willing to drastically overpay for them, one at a time, paid in advance.

Kinda a less exciting story that way, but that's all this is.

Edit -- since I wrote this, a lot more news has coming out citing an interview with one of the investors where he claims they will be producing the cars with a new engine, new transmission, new suspension, and all new electronics. I'm getting lots of messages with links to those stories.

I'd urge everyone to take these reports with a big grain of salt.  The legislation that allows them to produce the cars at all is specifically written to allow them to produce *replicas of classic cars*, and what they are now publicly discussing is sounding more and more like a new car.  That's not what the law allows them to do.  I'm not a lawyer and not qualified to say when they've crossed the line from building replicas into trying to become a low-volume car manufacturer without meeting the legal requirements for new cars.  But I'd urge you all to remember that this exact same group has been stopped from all their previous plans because they either weren't profitable or weren't legal.  It's appropriate to take a wait-and-see attitude with this one.  

Maybe they'll surprise us and actually produce something, but it looks like more press releases and legal questions at this point.  Most boutique car manufacturers fail before they ever put anything in customers' hands, and these guys face more legal hurdles than most of those failures.  ",418

"So, no spin on the positive or negatives, here's why the sentence was so low:

He (1) pled guilty (2) to one count (3) of *conspiracy to* defraud the United States gov.

(1) means he automatically would get a lower sentence, and probably negotiated with US Attorneys to get a lower recommendation from them as well.  [In fact, the US Attorney's office in this case recommended a year's probation for the officer.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/09/21/federal-prosecutors-seeking-one-year-probation-for-boston-detective-obstruction-case/XjIRf5bGSnCA8q6hmlvMmI/story.html)

(2) means its a small issue.  US Attorneys accept a 1 count plea deal (normally) when they don't have a lot of evidence.  Remember that for a plea deal, they didn't have to prove that he actually did what the title and article accuse him of doing.  

(3) means *conspiracy to*, i.e. he didn't necessarily act in the way the gov says he did.  Conspiracy means a deal between multiple members with some overt act in furtherance, but that act doesn't necessarily include what the US Attorney says.

The US Attorneys office wants to sound like they're nabbing bad guys, so they're going to publish their worst version of the facts because they no longer have to prove it.  ",662

"I'm 31 and didn't go to college, so I'm not a ""sniveling Millennial"" trying to beg out of my debt.  I have no college debt.

The education system is horribly, horrendously, irrevocably broken.  Paying tens of thousands of dollars for the opportunity to earn a livable wage is nuts.  Aside from specialized fields, the majority of college diplomas are only worthwhile because society (employers, specifically) have decided that they're worth something.  For the vast majority of middle class jobs, 6 mos of work experience is more valuable and relevant than 6 years of college education.  But you need the college education first.  Because reasons.

In my early 20's, I regretted not going to college.  I saw under-performing idiots getting promoted or hired at higher wages than me simply by virtue of their college degree.  I was a better worker, but they were able to check that box on their resume, so it inherently made them more valuable.  But overtime, know what happened?  It evened out considerably.  Years of employment showed that my work ethic was superior to their diploma.  Multiple promotions, raises, etc.

Now I'm 31 and happy with my salary.  I've separated myself as a superior employee and, if I want to climb the corporate ladder further, my employer knows that I'll succeed and they'll give me that chance.  I've decided that I'm content where I am (in fact, after multiple promotions over the span of a few years, I decided to re-evaluate and took a step down last year - even happier now), so I have no plans to do that.

And I don't have tens of thousands of college debt to pay off.  College education is largely a scam.  Many of the things college teaches should be available in free, public schooling.  College should be reserved for specialized learning - engineers, doctors, lawyers, etc.  It should not be a gateway to a livable wage, which is how it's treated and is what we tell kids.  When I was in high school and told people I had no plans to go to college, they thought I was a lunatic.  I don't remember any other kids in my class that didn't go to college.

College diplomas are largely used during the hiring process as an easy and lazy way to separate candidates.  They really do not have any meaningful impact on the potential quality of the candidate.",145

The federal government definitely didn't do enough research into their loony belief system before beginning the raid, but it was also definitely the Branches who instigated the deadly battle by killing ATF officers in the initial February raid, and there's much evidence to suggest they also spread gasoline around the compound during the FBI raid months later.

It's a very fascinating and complex story, with a bit of blame to go around on all sides, but ultimately I do tend to side with the federal government's sentiment that those folks needed to be stopped somehow. They were abusing children physically and young women sexually at the compound, for one thing.

"I have bunches of stories. Primarily, the worst complications I've seen come from the surgical teams. Unfortunately, it's a lottery who's on surgical call the night of admission so it's a toss up who becomes the treating team. 

Often, patients admitted to the ""diversity hires"" have long, complex surgeries which are performed for reasons that don't entirely make sense on review. Moreover, given the complex surgeries, outcomes can be poor. 

For example, we recently had one case of a young 30 y/o F who was admitted for appendicitis, but was otherwise normal and healthy. Normally this is treated with a simple laparoscopic appendix removal. For reasons that aren't entirely clear, the patient's emergent surgery was delayed by several days and she became very septic. The CT scan on admission showed a leaking appendix, which usually merits immediate admission to the OR. She ended up with removal of half her colon, perforation of her colon resulting in several deep abdominal abscesses, and a colostomy bag. Her course ended up becoming so complicated that she stayed several weeks in the ICU and almost died. ",147

I just dislike how biased the presentation is. Stop stating x many people were killed in such a way as to imply that police shouldn't be killing anyone at all.

At this point I don't even know the previously mentioned statistic because noone covers it. It is always one or two cases of innocence with no justified cases to compare it to.

There was a problem of employees who mistakened themselves for corrections officers... Deliberately escalating situations with agitated patients until physical intervention was necessary, etc. Not that such behaviors from a corrections officer would be acceptable. The nonprofit company running the hospital did little to nothing to address this.

I dealt mostly in admissions. It was critical that we searched patients and their belongings at this point for any items that could be used as weapons or for self-injury. Searches, in general, were cursory. A quick pat-down and an inventory of packed items, if I or most of my cohorts were conducting it... those of the CO-mindset were much more invasive. We confiscated items such as belts and shaving razors.

Elopements (read: escapes by those involuntarily committed for evaluation) became more frequent at one point. Many of the elopements were due to patients scaling the chain link fence surrounding the recreation area. 

The administration's response was to line the top of the fence with razor wire. I confiscated sharp objects so that they could provide fairly easy access to razor wire. 

I quit at that point. I signed up to work in a hospital, not a prison.

&gt;When a homeowner was ambushed by two armed intruders, he and his mother were soon on the losing end of a vicious encounter. Both victims were reportedly pistol-whipped after the burglars, based on evidence found at the scene, arrived at the home and attempted to portray themselves as police officers.

&gt;According to Atlanta-area resident Timo Hernandez, his mother was visiting from out of town when the their dinner was interrupted Wednesday evening by a knock at the door.

&gt;“When I opened the door,” he said,” these two guys stormed in with guns and started pistol-whipping me and took me to the ground.”

&gt;Reports indicate one intruder hit and kicked his mother, who suffered a heart attack during the attack. Hernandez said the other forced him to a bedroom where the gunman demanded money.

&gt;“He put a gun to my head, and I just started fighting back,” he recalled.

&gt;Fortunately, it was in that bedroom that his father had stored a hunting rifle, which Hernandez was able to grab during the altercation. He shot both burglars as they attempted to run out of the home they had just forced their way into.

&gt;One got as far as a neighboring yard before he died. The other was able to flee in a car, but he only made it to a nearby restaurant. He died at a nearby hospital the next day.

&gt;While he regrets the loss of life that transpired, Hernandez made it clear that he believes he and his mother owe their lives to the presence of a gun in the home.

Maybe because if people lose faith in Verizon, the economy still works?  Maybe because if people are afraid Delta will go under, Delta doesn't face immediate capital calls worth 10x its equity?

Bank runs are incredibly dangerous, and are a serious threat to any economy.  The US ""bailout,"" wasn't so much a bailout as it was temporary permission to violate minimum solvency requirements; it allowed them to value illiquid assets at reasonable prices on their balance sheets, rather than requiring them to liquidate anything and everything on their balance sheet at whatever price they could get for them in a market where there were no buyers.

And just because some of the names stayed around, let's not pretend that equity-holders in these American companies didn't get wiped out.  The people who owned AIG, Fannie Mae, General Motors, etc. all lost effectively everything - but the names and (most of) the jobs got preserved.  In every way except formally (which would have taken years and cost hundreds of millions in legal fees), these companies went bankrupt.  Hell, GM, Lehman Brothers, etc. *did* formally go bust.

Paramedics confirmed that while grabbing for a handhold to stabilize himself, he also accidentally discharged a 20-gauge shotgun into the back of his own head three times. At some point several minutes earlier, he also mistook arsenic for Equal, stirring the deadly poison into his morning tea.

"Everybody [read this:](http://audubonportland.org/news/audubon-society-of-portland-statement-on-the-occupation-of-malheur-national-wildlife-refuge)

""Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt to protect the vast populations of waterbirds that were being decimated by wanton killing by the plume trade. The 188,000 acre refuge represents some of the most important bird habitat on the Pacific Flyway. It is one of the crown jewels of the National Wildlife Refuge System and belongs to all Americans. In 2013, the Refuge adopted a long-term management plan developed through an inclusive collaborative process that brought together the local community, tribes, conservation groups, state and federal agencies, and other stakeholders. These stakeholders have continued to work together to implement this strategy which includes one of the biggest wetland restoration efforts ever undertaken.

The occupation of Malheur by armed, out of state militia groups puts one of America’s most important wildlife refuges at risk. It violates the most basic principles of the Public Trust Doctrine and holds hostage public lands and public resources to serve the very narrow political agenda of the occupiers. The occupiers have used the flimsiest of pretexts to justify their actions—the conviction of two local ranchers in a case involving arson and poaching on public lands. Notably, neither the local community or the individuals convicted have requested or endorsed the occupation or the assistance of militia groups.

Portland Audubon fought 100 years ago to protect this incredible place. The powerful images taken by Portland Audubon founder, William Finley, of Malheur’s incredible bird populations and the wanton killing that was being inflicted upon them, caused President Roosevelt to make Malheur one of the first wildlife refuges in the Western United States. Portland Audubon calls upon the local, state and federal authorities to once again protect this incredible place for the amazing wildlife that live there and to preserve this natural heritage for current and future generations. Portland Audubon greatly appreciates the outstanding federal employees that staff the refuge, as well as members of the local community who have rejected this occupation. We hope for a safe, expeditious end to this armed occupation so that the myriad of local and non-local stakeholders can continue to work together to restore Malheur in ways that are supportive of both the local ecology and the local economy—the occupiers are serving nobody’s interests except their own.""",223

[**U.S. Stymied as Guns Flow to Mexican Cartels** - APRIL 14, 2009 - NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/us/15guns.html?_r=0
)

&gt;John Phillip Hernandez, a 24-year-old unemployed machinist who lived with his parents, walked into a giant sporting goods store here in July 2006, and plunked $2,600 in cash on a glass display counter. A few minutes later, Mr. Hernandez walked out with three military-style rifles.

&gt;One of those rifles was recovered seven months later in Acapulco, Mexico, where it had been used by drug cartel gunmen to attack the offices of the Guerrero State attorney general, court documents say. Four police officers and three secretaries were killed.

&gt;Although Mr. Hernandez was arrested last year as part of a gun-smuggling ring, most of the 22 others in the ring are still at large. Before their operation was discovered, the smugglers had transported what court documents described as at least 339 high-powered weapons to Mexico over a year and a half, federal agents said.

&gt;*""There is no telling how long that group was operating before we caught on to them,” said J. Dewey Webb, the agent in charge of the Houston division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.*

&gt;Noting there are about *1,500 licensed gun dealers in the Houston area, Mr. Webb added, “You can come to Houston and go to a different gun store every day for several months and never alert any one.”*

&gt;The case highlights a major obstacle facing the United States as it tries to meet a demand from Mexico to curb the flow of arms from the states to drug cartels. *The federal system for tracking gun sales, crafted over the years to avoid infringements on Second Amendment rights, makes it difficult to spot suspicious trends quickly and to identify people buying for smugglers, law enforcement officials say.*

&gt;As a result, in some states along the Southwest border where firearms are lightly regulated, gun smugglers can evade detection for months or years. *In Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, dealers can sell an unlimited number of rifles to anyone with a driver’s license and a clean criminal record without reporting the sales to the government.*


&gt;*“Guns are legal to possess in this country,” said William J. Hoover, the assistant director for operations of the federal firearms agency. “If you stop me between the dealer and the border, I am still legal, because I can possess those guns.”*

&gt;*To be sure, the A.T.F. and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have stepped up their efforts to stop smuggling over the last two years. Last year, some 200 indictments were handed up against straw buyers and gun smugglers, breaking up at least a dozen trafficking rings.*

[**Holder Revives Talk Of An Assault Weapons Ban** - - February 26, 2009- - CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/holder-revives-talk-of-an-assault-weapons-ban/)


&gt;Attorney General Eric Holder was busy announcing the capture of more than 50 alleged members of the notorious Sinaloa Cartel yesterday when he unwittingly stepped into a larger debate about gun control. 

&gt;Responding to a reporter's question on weapons' regulations, Holder said, ""Well, as President Obama indicated during the campaign, there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons. I think that will have a positive impact in Mexico, at a minimum.""

&gt;Yet there is a reservoir of support for stricter gun control within Holder's party. Last week, over 50 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to President Obama urging him to enforce a ban on importing assault weapons, citing rising gun violence in Mexico. The Sinaloa Cartel, which Holder was discussing at yesterday's press conference, is involved in drug and weapons trafficking in the U.S. and Mexico.

&gt;During the campaign, Mr. Obama sought to strike a delicate balance on the issue of gun rights. 

&gt;He pledged to make the assault weapons ban permanent, promised to push for childproofing guns and said he wanted to close the gun show loophole, which permits sales of firearms at gun shows without requiring a background check. 

&gt;This is not the first time that Holder has voiced support for tighter restrictions. In his confirmation hearings, Holder said he supported closing the loophole, banning cop killer bullets, and making the ban on assault weapons permanent.

He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn’t earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major’s father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap,” he counseled one and all, and everyone said, “Amen.”
Major Major’s father was an outspoken champion of economy in government, provided it did not interfere with the sacred duty of government to pay farmers as much as they could get for all the alfalfa they produced that no one else wanted or for not producing any alfalfa at all.

&gt;Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was established on August 18, 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt as the Lake Malheur Reservation. Roosevelt set aside unclaimed government lands encompassed by Malheur, Mud and Harney Lakes “as a preserve and breeding ground for native birds.” The newly established “Lake Malheur Reservation” was the 19th of 51 wildlife refuges created by Roosevelt during his tenure as president. At the time, Malheur was the third refuge in Oregon and one of only six refuges west of the Mississippi.

I was laid off a few years ago and then offered a $10 an hour job laying concrete over an hour drive from me. My pay before being laid off was $15.50, which means my unemployment probably came out to $11-$12 (Ballpark).

My 71 year old mother couldn't, for the life of her, fathom why I passed up a shit job making ""good money"", even if I ""just had to drive an hour"".

After hearing it a couple times, I had to sit down and run the math with her. Gas to get there, my living expenses, child support, and the money I've been paying every week on lawyers fees and other debt I was saddled with. 

It blew my moms mind to finally learn that $10 was not ""good money"" and that taking that job would have ended up *costing me money* in a roundabout way. 

I then explained to her than in our area (central IL) a 20-something couple that lives together and expects to have a social life need to both have 40 hour a week jobs that pay **minimum** $13 an hour. That number goes up pretty quick if you decide to live in Peoria, IL or Bloomington.

"You know, I want to step in and say something that might not be popular.

I have a wife and two children. While at college, we got food stamps. While unemployed in my field following the shuttering of the company I worked at and working any kind of 9-5 I could get my hands on, we got food stamps. It let my kids eat. It let me eat. I was damn grateful for it. In fact, we received so much more than we needed for a while (which you can't refuse, btw, you take it all or you take none) that we shared the bounty with those around us who were similarly impoverished, but unable to get EBT for themselves because they were single. Ours became a table where friends could get a good meal at least a couple of times a week, because they were on the ramen-and-hunger diet otherwise.

I'm glad to be off food stamps, and back working in my field, where I can continue to share my good fortune with those around me who haven't been as blessed. I have spent a lot of time in circles that must rely, for one reason or another, on food stamps to survive. Contrary to what the popular parties and outlets want you to believe, no one *wants* to be on food stamps. It is a shitty life. It takes a ton of repeated paperwork and reporting to keep food on the table, and it feels like a job all by itself. I am a college educated man who works in a fairly complex field, but that food stamps paperwork is something else. It is a struggle to parse, and I read rulebooks for fun. Add to that the fact that you have to keep faxing in documents and filling out forms every few months, and you are already crushing the dignity out of people left feeling like criminals for needing to eat and committing the sin of poverty in America. It isn't the high life.

Is there fraud in the system? Of course, there is fraud in every system. In fact, studies of government aid show that food stamps is no more prone to wastage and fraud than any other organization or program. Further excoriating the poor because some asshole cashes out his EBT card for hookers and blow isn't going to help anyone. Most of the people I have ever met on food stamps are working at least 40 hours, if not 60 or more, every week. It just isn't enough. Employers, especially giants like Walmart that rely on this form of indirect government subsidy coupled with shameful labor practices abroad, often don't pay enough for people to get by. I live in a cheap place, have a good job, and don't waste my money, and it is still a stretch.

The problem isn't that a few poor people are eating better than they should. It isn't that the poor receive financial assistance to avoid starvation at all. It goes a lot deeper than that. I'll be the first to admit that it is a complex problem with no easy solution, since I can't simply tell everyone to selflessly love and share with one another and expect anyone to do it. But we should probably start somewhere other than blaming those who are already only an EBT card away from extreme hunger.",294

1. Liberal society depends on defending freedom of speech. The person this post is about is against it. If we can claim that the Phelps family of Kansas does not represent Christianity then generally middle left liberals should be able to oust this wack job.

Edit: Apparently I need to include a history/legal lesson for some people to get it. 

The United States has what is called duel sovereignty, more commonly know as Federalism. The Federal Government and State Government are considered co-equal sovereigns with different but sometimes overlapping jurisdiction. Because of the Supremacy Clause in the US Constitution, US Law overrides state law when they conflict.

When concerning property, a nature consequence of this is that Federal Land geographically within a State is neither politically part of that State nor within its jurisdiction, but instead within Federal jurisdiction. Just like how an embassy in a foreign country is not part of the country inwhich it resides, and the host country has no jurisdiction within the embassy.

Oregon became at State in 1859. At that time, this Wildlife Refuge was Federal Land. Therefore, it is not part of Oregon and never was. It is Federal Property within Congress's power to regulate under the Property Clause, as cited above.",135

"I spent the morning splicing a new rectifier rack into a $1500 fire truck alternator. I'll spend the afternoon on a metal lathe turning out new parts for obsolete bow thrusters on a 110-foot yacht.

I make $17k a year. Skilled labor. I could go work at the only other place that does this stuff, but they pay the same. 

But it's me, not the 'market'.

edit: Well that got my inbox going. I'll try to cover the bases:

Yes, that's what I make for a forty-hour week. Not sure what I'd have to gain by lying about it, but since 'bullshit' has been called several times today, here ya go: http://i.imgur.com/UCgYtqP.jpg I get one every Friday. By the time I file my 1099 and settle up, I keep about $17k of the $18200 I receive over 52 weeks. Yes, I pay taxes.

I'm well aware I'm being fucked. I'd work somewhere better if they'd hire me. Competition is stiff at the bottom and you take what you can get when you've got mouths to feed. There's only so much risk you can accept in looking at options when this is the case. I fail, we're screwed.

Command a higher wage? Good way to get shown the door. They'll run down the list of people they've fired until they find one that needs a paycheck. I work with one of these guys currently. He's paid less than I am. Georgia is a 'right to work' state, so I have the right to be let go at any time for any reason.

It is a niche field, but the demand is very good where we are. Plenty of money in the work, if I own the place. Not so much if I'm doing the work for the guy that does. Hopefully I'll have my own shop one day, but I'm far more likely to open one in the wake of his passing than I am to save enough money to quit and become a competitor. That's pretty much my long-term plan at this point: outlive the boss man.

firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and
profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms. A dealer can be “engaged in the

person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of
a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.**

Since it was 2009 and their was a very real chance of things jumping off between us and Iran at the time we were all freaked out. I was in my shop, sledgehammer in hand ready to destroy anything and everything I could that might hold data on it. 

We had filled all our sink bags and were literally waiting on the word to ruin everything.     We drifted to about 13 Nautical Miles (12 being territorial waters) before the engines started up again.

It went as far as our captain giving us instructions on how to deal with being taken.   We were instructed to not resist boarding unless things became hostile (shooting/ect.) and only provide them with our name and serial numbers.   My division was specifically told we would identify as a CS (cook) and not our real rate ;-)

Keep in mind mainstream media already do this for alleged victims of sexual abuse.

Likewise mainstream outlets typically  don't name juveniles accused of crimes in juvenile court.

"Seems most of it goes to administration, while faculty has been starved and stressed. There's a book about the phenomena: ""The Fall of Faculty and the Rise of the All Administrative University, and Why it Matters""
Working in higher ed I've seen it shifting in the last 20 some years. These institutions are top heavy, there's a host of 'deans' and other people on campus who are there to 'guide' the university or 'manifest' its mission. Those are great goals, but those goals were already in place, being executed by faculty run departments. 

University administrations counter that they have merely responded to the desires of the students (consumers) who have demanded more ""campus life"", higher ed must be packaged and sold as a 'coming of age experience' that readies you for the job market. Universities collect a good sum of money in student fees that go toward creating the 'campus life experience' and promoting the institutional brand. Student service departments control large budgets, large universities in the UC system control multi-million dollar budgets. Creating and servicing campus life has become its own field. You can now obtain a degree in ""Student Services Administration""
http://view2.fdu.edu/academics/petrocelli-college/graduate-degrees/student-services-administration-massa/

Further, some growth in administration is due to ADA law that requires accommodations for disabled people. Universities work to provide needed support, while the definitions of what ""disability"" can mean have been vastly enlarged. All kinds of cognitive, and behavioral conditions now qualify for a host of support services which are costly to provide. It's cool that so many people can now go to colleges and universities, who might not have had a chance in the past, but it does cost money.
Also, many decades of litigation for a variety of offenses and complaints have forced institutions to protect themselves. This is why it's common to see them erring on the side of caution, and making every effort to reduce liability.

I went to a hospital for mental health issues, and I was put on a 24 hour hold even though I didn't meet the requirements for such a hold (was not delusional, nor was I a danger to anyone or myself). I complained quite a bit and raised a little bit of hell as panic sunk in that I was being locked away, and they grabbed me and strapped my wrists and ankles to a gurney and put me in the ""Quiet Room."" Yeah, it's literally a soundproofed little closet called the Quiet Room.

They gave me three injections to put me to sleep against my will. I screamed for help. After about 15 minutes of being unable to move my body, the nurse came in and unstrapped my left wrist and right leg, leaving me still half restrained and unable to turn my body. I pleaded with her to let me move because of the discomfort, and she simply smiled and said ""Get some sleep."" It was as if she was taunting me [""I'm about to let you free-- ohp! Nevermind!""]

I woke up in another room, and they began to force medicine down my throat. It was absolutely disgusting. They treat you like a criminal in a mental health facility. These people are monsters.

Ironically, such treatment has the opposite affect on someone's mental stability if you are trying to rehabilitate them. I was reluctant to share any of my thoughts or symptoms with the staff afterwards because I wanted to make sure they believed I was ready to be released. After 3 days, I was allowed to leave.

The facility in question is Deaconess at UC Health. I complained after being released, but doubt anything was done. Those places are just absolutely abhorrent. Never going back if I can help it.

Now, the US prisoners everybody was bitching about not being in the Iran deal get released ~~days~~ hours before the deal goes into effect. We are playing nice with Iran and they seem to be moving in that direction as well. Yeah they captured a few sailors for a day or two but they ended up being stranded in their waters so they had the right to hold them. They weren't abused or anything like that and they were promptly released. This is how diplomacy works and the people on the right who have done nothing but bitch and fear monger over this deal needs to shut their faces.

I've sat through those programs. They cemented in my mind the conviction that minorities are less ""coworkers"" and more ""walking, talking liabilities"".

Sad too, because I was one of the ones who didn't give a f*** about a person's ethnicity once I had decided they were smart and effective.

.
EDIT: Okay lemme explain.

I worked in an engineering shop, 90% male, 70% white, 25% Indian, 5% other. The work culture was fantastic, it even felt kind of like summer camp, we were all in it knee deep and I was surrounded on all sides by brilliant minds. Nobody cared one bit about ethnicity: engineers, more than any other group, only care about ""What works"". 

Then we got acquired by MonoCorp Inc., and thus began the sensitivity training and sexual harassment training and diversity training. The training was the first time *any of us* had ever even had a passing thought about ethnicity. Suddenly ethnicity was capital-I important. Suddenly it was something we had to Be Aware Of. Now we felt like we should be tiptoeing about . . . something.

.
EDIT2: Okay, here's the short short version:

If your goal is for me to *actually respect* you, then you can't begin our relationship by announcing that I've got to give you *any kind* of special treatment.

These sensitivity lectures are conflating ""respectful treatment"" with ""respect"". And by *demanding* the former, they make the latter significantly harder to obtain.

You know how I treat somebody I *actually respect*? I openly call him/her a dumbass when they screw up. THAT is respect... because I'd never say that to somebody who actually *is* a dumbass.

.EDIT3: Some more examples come to mind:

One of my longest-term coworkers is British. I profoundly respect this dude, I think of him as *at least equal* to my talents. And I make fun of him relentlessly. I call him a damn limey, I ask when's the last time he had spotted dick in his mouth, I've threatened to throw all his tea in the harbor again, and I tease him mercilessly about the last big mistake he made that I was the one to catch. That's what respect looks like.

"I'm one of a family of three adults who receive SNAP benefits.  My family is my mom and her younger brother, both of whom are physically disabled, and myself.  In 1968 the tie rod end broke on my grandpa's car and it plunged 50 feet over the side of a steep hill.  This was in the days before car seats.  My grandma was holding her eight month old twins.  One, my uncle, was ejected from the car and landed next to the road, where a passing motorist found him (and realized the car was at the bottom of the hill in the brush).  My grandma remained conscious long enough to hand her daughter out to grandpa, and then grandma went into a six month coma.  My uncle's skull was fractured in four places, all of his ribs were broken, and he had numerous internal injuries.  His twin sister had numerous internal injuries as well.  My mom was fifteen at the time of the accident.  She and her older sister both dropped out of high school to take care of there dad and, as they were eventually released from the hospital, their mom and the twins.

So my uncle has had numerous serious physical difficulties throughout his entire life.  My mom's disabilities are the result of working shitty, low paying jobs for years and years because that's all that she could get in our rural area.  My income alone isn't enough to pay our monthly bills and purchase food.  Without food stamps we would go hungry.  Period.  We're still poor--and I'm not ashamed of that because I work--but things would be unbearable if we were going hungry on a regular basis.  And at times in the past, we've done just that.  

Writing this out is probably like pissing in the wind.  But I see some unbelievably ignorant comments on Reddit sometimes regarding people who use food stamps/SNAP/welfare benefits.  The fact is that sometimes really shitty things happen for no goddamned good reason and all you can do is keep your head up, keep pushing forward trying to better your lot in life.  

There was a comment in this section, lower down, about how someone was seen purchasing steaks with food stamps, and how shitty that was to do.  You know what?  If I can find a cheap piece of steak or roast that's been marked down because it's close to the sell-by date, you bet your ass I'm gonna jump on that deal.  A tough cut of meat can spend the day in my slow cooker and become the foundation of a big pot of stew, vegetable soup, a big stir fry, or some other nutritious meal that will feed us for a couple of days.  And once in a while I'll buy a treat, like a bag of store brand chips (when I have a coupon) or a box of brownie mix.  Because sometimes you need a little something that makes you smile when you're physically exhausted from working a job you hate, and know you have to go back to.

Edit:  There have been a lot of thoughtful and kind comments in regard to what I wrote.  Just wanted to say thanks for that--kind of a shot in the arm.  Also, my thanks to the person who gilded me.  I appreciate that act of generosity and I'll pay it forward.  Kindness is an overlooked virtue in some ways.  We pay lip service to the idea of a simple kindness but it can make a dark day a lot brighter.  You guys have made my day brighter--thank you for that.",4059

"Netflix shows the content everywhere it possibly can. It's the rights holders who determine where they want to license their content.

Edit: Because this is the first question that always arises... I'm no expert on this subject *at all,* but there are a few reasons content creators/owners might not want a service like Netflix to show their content in some areas. Perhaps they hope to drive DVD sales in a market where that's a potentially more lucrative option. Perhaps they have their own competing streaming service (TV networks like CBS and NBC might stream their own content and make ad revenue from it, and keep that content off Netflix or Hulu to drive traffic to their service). Perhaps there's a deal between the content *owner* and the *creator* dictating how and where the content can be shown. There are probably myriad other reasons as well, like I said I'm no expert.",141

"Honestly, as one Montanan to another, people here seem to be pretty responsible. I think it's the genuine small town feel of the whole state because I don't meet a lot of honest-to-god assholes. Montana still owns a very western vibe and a lot of the locals are surprisingly handy and hard working. I've met some bigots, some people who are irrationally racist, though they seem to shy away from that racism when actually around minorities, like stage racism or something? But I've never met somebody that didn't love our outdoors. I think Montanans are kind of a special little culture in the US. Just want to live and let live it seems. Pretty nice place to grow up in case anybody is curious.

Fun stories about being from Montana.

One of the first things people always ask is if we still ride horses. We do. Everywhere.(Just kidding we're civilized and have some pretty nice roads.)

Most Americans ask if I'm from Canada because you *never* hear about Montana, when you do you should know the fourth largest state in the union is cheering every time they see one of our towns mentioned. Seriously, you'll be watching a show and they'll say,""We're going up to a small town in Montana called Bozeman."" Everybody in the room is like ""Woo! Yeah! We got mentioned! Feel our presence other Americans!""

Technically, if you ride a horse to school they are still legally obligated to feed and water it.

Our mountains may be unbeatable. Truly, some of the most magnificent pieces of nature are in Montana and since it gets so fucking cold in the winter our population refuses to exceed a million people, also a pretty nice perk.

The one thing that sucks about Montana is there isn't much to do. Especially in the winter. Oh, it's negative 9 today? Yeah, yeah, I'll just pray I don't get in a wreck and die anywhere remotely outside of town. It's actually a serious problem in the state that if you get in a wreck outside of towns you better pray somebody finds you because you're fucked if you don't know what you're doing.

Senior year of high school it was negative 22F or lower for a full week. During which time the city of Bozeman was registered as the coldest place on EARTH(For context, I didn't live in Bozeman at the time. Bozeman got down to I believe -56F). And school still wasn't cancelled for the poor Bozemanites. 

One of the semi-annoying things about when you leave Montana is you'll encounter two kinds of people. The kind that assume you're like a minor god and can handle anything(Oddly common among out of state employers, ""Oh you're from Montana, you can rebuild an engine in a snowstorm, riiiight??""). Or the kind that don't know their left hand from their right about what they're doing and you have to keep saving them from really minor things that you somehow learned in your childhood.

This specifically has buckets of stories attached to it. Fire starting, dear god out of staters are funny. 
My family use to sit and watch from our campsite as Californians would throw logs on a fire pit and sort of just, stare at it. Like they thought a bunch of wood together is what creates fire. It was always a joy walking over and getting fires started for tourists.(Oh my god, some Asians at Yellowstone were waaaayyyy funnier. They put two logs against each other and started yelling at each other because the fire wasn't starting. When we got a fire going for them they tried to cook some food, they threw a hotdog for each of them literally on the wood. At this point we told them to come eat with us and we taught them how to cook around a fire, they were very thankful because apparently they had some woody hotdogs on their prior day there.) 

The little road hiccups people had were down right adorable sometimes. When I was a kid I remember a family of four was sitting out in the cold waiting for help. It was like 10F so my dad decided to pull over and get this. They pulled over for their dad to pee. Then their van got stuck(Was sliding and not moving anywhere) They decided to turn off the car to save gas(Don't do this Heat is life people). I was 8 at the time and me and my dad got them out of the ice in less than 5 minutes. What else... I watched a lady try to use pepper spray on a grazing dear. She legitimately thought it was a bear and feared for her childs life. Like, what the hell! 

I can't keep talking without totally defeating the point of my post. If you do find yourself in Montana and in distress don't hesitate to talk with locals. It's basically a statewide joke at this point with how many funny things tourists struggle with so they may give you some shit but you'll be good to go in no time.",121

"I think that people tend to underestimate the number of complications involved here. Imagine yourself as a single man media company. You make a video and it's pretty good, but it's your job and you spent a lot of money making it, so you now you have to turn a profit (preferably enough to make another video!).

You find someone willing to show your video on broadcast TV in the US. Great! But they only operate in the US. You think other people will want your video. You come to an agreement where every time they show your video they give you $100 but they can only do it in the US, that way you can give the rights in Canada to someone else who can better serve the Canadian market.

You find another partner in Canada. Great! They love your video and want to show it. But to do it, they want exclusive rights in Canada and they are willing to pay for it (fair enough!). They also want a first-rights of refusal option on your next video (they get to bid on the Canadian rights for your next video before anyone else because they think you are a star). This is great! You sign on the line.

Now Netflix comes around. They've seen your video and love it! They want to show it to the whole world. But there's a sticking point. Your Canadian partner paid a lot for their exclusive rights, and they don't want competition with Netflix. So you work a deal where they can stream in the US, but for now Canada is off the table. And they may be off the table for you next video too!

Nobody in this whole string of agreements has done anything malicious or anything unethical. But now an emergent property of this arrangement is that Netflix subscribers in Canada can't watch the video. Everyone in this string of behaviors is being reasonable, and yet the outcome will seem unreasonable to an observer.

edit: A lot of people are concerned about why a company would want exclusive distribution rights. the fact is that exclusivity has value. Do you really want to schedule an airing of Cool Guy Super Dude for Sunday night, only to find out your competitor is going to show a marathon of it all day on Saturday? Furthermore once they have paid for that exclusivity they have a fiduciary responsibility to everyone with interest in the company to get value out of it (even if the value is just minimal loss). Maybe they offer to license to Netflix but at a cost that Netflix doesn't find acceptable. Or they offer to sell the rights back so that you can sell to Netflix, but you know that the Canadian views won't pay enough to return on that purchase. Either way Netflix has trouble acquiring the Canadian rights.",336

"I strongly recommend that people educate themselves on the housing policies of the 1930s-1960s. Governments became extremely selective over investing in urban areas while the American population became spatially decentralized. It was written into federal underwriting that ""inharmonious"" racial groups should be excluded from receiving mortgage assistance via the FHA and subsequent housing/mortgage policies. 

So as African Americans are being excluded from purchasing homes and the cities began to be hypersegregated and disinvested in things became very bleak in the cities. 

Eventually, I think in the 60s the federal government removed the ""inharmonious"" race aspect but the damage was done and there was nothing to stop the financial and real-estate institutions to stick with old practices.

Eventually, loans were made available to people with no business receiving those loans. African Americans who finally had a chance to access a loan did so. Idk if anyone remembers 2008, but granting loans to people who can't pay for them doesn't work. That dealt another blow to African American homeownership.

So...in short, while ethnic/class/race groups do like to live among people like themselves, its difficult to say that African Americans chose to live in the central city entirely willingly.  ",350

When he pulled me over, I argued my case with him (because I'm an idiot). He went back into his cruiser and came back with a ticket. I hit record on my cell phone and asked him a series of questions about what had happened, and he gave me the same responses as before (he hadn't timed me, I'm not allowed to run red lights, I hadn't caused anyone to have to brake or swerve, and a few other legal things necessary for my defense) before angrily cutting me off with a question if I thought I had special rules just because I was on a bike.

Come court, the officer has a totally different story about what happened. He says he timed me, he was parked somewhere differently than where he was, that I caused a car to swerve, and that there was a car making a right hand turn that had to stop. He'd apparently looked up the law and made up a laundry list that made sure I violated each part of it. I was livid, but managed to restrain myself from yelling at him.

When his testimony was over, the judge gives me the floor, and I ask the officer a series of questions near on identical to the ones I'd asked him the night he pulled me over.

 I really don't like being without my penis for too long

It makes me feel like less of a man
 And I really hate to having to sit down
 Every time I take a leak

After a few hours of searching the house
 And calling everyone I could think of
 I was starting to get very depressed
 So I went to the Kiev and ate breakfast

Then as I walked down Second Avenue toward St. Mark's Place
 Where all those people sell used books and other junk on the street
 I saw my penis lying on a blanket next to a broken toaster oven
 Some guy was selling it

I had to buy it off him
 He wanted 22 bucks but I talked him down to 17
 I took it home, washed it off
 And put it back on

I was happy again, complete
 People sometimes tell me
 I should get it permanently attached but I don't know
 Even though sometimes it's a pain in the ass
 I like having a detachable penis

Detachable penis
 Detachable penis
 Detachable penis 

If you know this song, check out Jesus Was Way Cool.  They had some pretty funny music back in the day.  Small sample of lyrics from Jesus:

Jesus was way cool
Everybody liked Jesus
Everybody wanted to hang out with him
Anything he wanted to do, he did
He turned water into wine
And if he wanted to
He could have turned wheat into marijuana
Or sugar into cocaine
Or vitamin pills into amphetamines",235

The very obvious conflict of interest when police investigate other police should be more than apparent to everyone.

They will go to the ends of the earth to defend other officers in states all the way across the nation whom they have no contact with, but will happily claim that their fellow officer has done nothing wrong. The brotherhood or blue line is not only very real, but very pervasive in police culture.

If that weren't bad enough, procecutors have a close working relationship with police and rely on their investigations to secure convictions. Convictions are the biggest contributer to a procecutor advancing or looking ""good"" in their career. There is a symbiotic relationship between the two, with police providing that information, and procecutors protecting police and the departments.

Until police are taken out of the investigative portion of police misconduct, and procecutors are either set up regionally to specifically take on police misconduct cases, with that being the way to advance their career, this will just keep neutering any attempt at accountability.",771

Seriously. We are in charge of our lives, not some cosmic fate scheme? Control your attitude and manage your thoughts. Its not hard.

EDIT: To expand on this a bit. My girlfriend has a serious issue with this. She gets upset over things that are legitimately not related to her life then will start fights with me over it. Then when I shut her down citing that none of this is related to our relationship or any of the issues we have she says that something at work is stressing her out. I say, does that mean that you can treat me that way? Does some small stress in your life give you the green light on being mean to others? No. It doesn't. If we have a problem we can talk it out. But you failing to separate your feelings is not my problem nor should it be a serious issue in our relationship.

The point? Fucking control your heads people. Its not hard at all to look at something and say, ""This does not need to be in the same box as this"" and just like that! You're not bringing stress home from work, you're not bringing home stress to work. You're not letting your life mix up and make itself terrible. Everybody deals with bullshit that stresses them out.

Being white doesn't mean you hold the monopoly on being racist. If you're visibly poor, you'll probably get treated just as shitty as I am. In fact, you should hear the unbelievably racist and ignorant shit I hear about white people at family reunions.

You want minorities to be equal? Start looking at us like equals, and stop infantilizng us. I'll tell you a little secret I've noticed, this bullshit focus on race is only making people more racist: more and more I start to sense a silent resentment growing against minorities because people have decided it's fine to assume every white person is automatically priviliged and therefore should face some heat for being born white. You are just enforcing the belief that we're all different, which breeds the dangerous and common ""us vs them"" mentality. 

Furthermore, I know this might be considered ""pandering"" or ""circle-jerking"" to /r/news users, and I know there are enough ""legit"" racists in this sub who would love nothing more than to see me gtfo of their country along with the recent influx of immigrants.

"The re-sentencing was done because the lower court illegally reduced the sentence below the mandatory minimum sentencing guideline of 5 years; this is only occurring now due to the appeals process and subsequent failure to reach the supreme court.

&gt;By law, arson on federal land carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence.  When the Hammonds were originally sentenced, they argued that the five-year mandatory minimum terms were unconstitutional and the trial court agreed and imposed sentences well below what the law required based upon the jury’s verdicts.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, upheld the federal law, reasoning that “given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.”  The court vacated the original, unlawful sentences and ordered that the Hammonds be resentenced “in compliance with the law.”  In March 2015, the Supreme Court rejected the Hammonds’ petitions for certiorari. Today, Chief Judge Aiken imposed five year prison terms on each of the Hammonds, with credit for time they already served.

Unjustified shootings by LEOs are not just a a problem for minorities.  All focusing on how the issue (unjustified shootings by police) effects minorities does is belittle/disenfranchise victims (and their families) who just happen to be white.

And if Reddit is any indication, it's fragmenting groups that have a common concern (unjustified shootings by police) by making the focus of the conversation about skin tone rather than the actual problem.

A black man and a white man unjustly killed by LEOs are dead all the same.

Yes, I get that it happens at different rates (when compared to the total race population), but that's going to happen when the racial groups interact with LEOs at disproportionate rates.  I also get there are examples of blatant racism being shown by some of the cops involved in the shootings.

As with many other issues, focusing on just a subset of victims (blacks in this case) does is fragment limited ~~reasons~~ resources and creates conflicts between people that ultimately have a common goal.  There's no benefit to basing the conversation around skin color and plenty of reasons not to.

From the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto#Fuel_tank_controversy

&gt; [...] Gary Schwartz said the case against the Pinto was not clear-cut. [...] The number who died in Pinto rear-impact fires was well below the hundreds cited in contemporary news reports and closer to the 27 recorded [...] Given the Pinto's production figures (over 3 million built), this was not substantially worse than typical for the time. Schwartz said that the car was no more fire-prone than other cars of the time, that its fatality rates were lower than comparably sized imported automobiles, and that the supposed ""smoking gun"" document that plaintiffs said demonstrated Ford's callousness in designing the Pinto was actually a document based on National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulations about the value of a human life — rather than a document containing an assessment of Ford's potential tort liability.

"I think part of the problem is also consumerist culture and lack of basic finance education in in public schooling. I didn't understand the power of interest until I *elected* to take a finance course in *college*. And then I spent a gap year making ~minimum wage, barely paying off bills, letting my student debts grow, all the while working in an ER seeing people my own age get sick/pregnant/injured. This all really made the lesson hit home, and I'm thankful I made it this far without blundering or getting injured. 

Meanwhile, public schooling is more focused on getting high scores and sending kids to expensive colleges than preparing them for careers or at least learning how to *afford* an expensive college. And because people don't understand personal finance, the power of interest, the enormous cost of retirement, or the importance of preparing for costly medical emergencies, people are putting money into new iphones and televisions instead of savings. Teens are still getting pregnant and ruining their lives, and yet people are fucking protesting Planned Parenthood and still trying to teach abstinence-only sex ed. And here I am sitting in an ER still seeing teens discover they're pregnant with a child they don't want.

I think a lot of the stuff we learn in school now is valuable, but I think personal finance and health deserve more way more time than they get now. Things like disease, car accidents, loans, obesity, and sex affect us early on and quickly become more relevant as we age. These are things that don't wait, either. Your high school didn't have calculus 2 so you need to take an extra course in college? Sucks, but you can find time.

"The municipalities are suffering from the same issues that everyone else is: lack of revenues, increasing costs for everything, and so on.  At that level, the costs to repair roads and other infrastructure balloons, along with every other municipal project on the docket. 

So when it comes down to it, many places, especially those like Flint, Baltimore, and others that suffer from urban blight, population flight, and poverty, are struggling with the conundrum of where to spend their resources. Do they fix the crumbling roads? Address the bridges? Invest in the schools that are falling apart? Improve policing and fire? Do things to attract more people to boost revenues?

There comes a point at which it's no longer a problem of checking off a list of things to keep fixed every year, and instead a case of the proverbial drowning homeowner trying to triage the worst things based on the complaints, and hoping something else doesn't fall apart. 

Cities don't have huge amounts of money to blow, states have to spread their money out across the state along with addressing state-wide necessities, and the feds are trying to handle the entire country.

"I can't upvote this comment enough. You said everything I was thinking.

The [FREAK](https://thehackernews.com/2015/03/freak-openssl-vulnerability.html) OpenSSL exploit last year was due to export-grade encryption downgrade attacks. Export-grade encryption being:

&gt;in 1990s, the US government attempted to regulate the export of products utilizing ""strong"" encryption and devices were loaded with weaker ""export-grade"" encryption before being shipped out of the country.

See how well that worked.

&gt;It's also rather telling that in a lot of cases, the people handling corporate security and information technology are behind the curve and don't understand the situation completely, overcomplicate what they're doing, and don't bother to face reality about how to fix their problems.

I think there's more to it as well. There was a blog post on /r/netsec that I can't find. But it talks about the hiring practices of government jobs (can be applied to private sector) being at odds with really good security researchers. And the best security researchers not wanting to work a 9-5 for low pay and would rather be consultants/penetration testers.

Also, have you taken the Security+ certification test? It's a complete joke. I attended a 5-week authorized course at a for-profit school. The instructor didn't know the difference between asymmetrical vs symmetrical encryption, and could comprehend the issue with buffer overflows. I didn't bother even taking the exam after studying for it. 

There is no decent ""authority"" on security testing/credentials, and it really isn't taught in Universities. So you have CS majors leaving college with little to no security knowledge. You have to teach yourself or hope your college has a club that is security minded.

"Here's the facts that I can gather:

- He was *certainly* surveilled. His counter-surveillance shows this. It's not paranoia when you have a shot of a guy in a cowboy hat filming your house with a ~~FLIR~~ expensive camera that could be a thermal imager on a gimbal. That sort of set up is worth tens of thousands of dollars. This leaves no doubt in my mind that someone was watching him 

- The local police are notorious corrupt and have been casing people to make sure that when they perform an arrest, more assets can be seized. 

- The victim had criticized the police and days before his death had voiced concern that they would kill him.

- He's then killed and his house is set ablaze. 

Using Occam's Razor, the most plausible explanation is that the police were surveiling him. They're the only ones with the motive and capabilities to do so. While this is not proof that they are the killers, it's pretty damning evidence that should at least make the Fresno Police the prime suspects. 

EDIT: My point is that it's a falsehood to say that he didn't do anything to warrant attention. He most certainly did, because they *were* watching him. If it was because of those forum comments...that's their choice. But they got made on their stake out, so they were there.

EDIT2: Changed FLIR - I concede it's too difficult to tell if it is actually a FLIR camera.  It could be, and police use them extensively to spot grow ops. It's less about what kind of imagery was used, but more that he was actually under surveillance.",159

See this [NYT article](https://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/050598unabomb-evidence.html)

When an unkempt-looking man bought the paper, the agents followed, trailing him to a small apartment in a San Francisco suburb. Their hopes dissolved when they learned he was a writer who had been already investigated and eliminated.""

"Please watch the [video](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=9d2_1453924551) before jumping to conclusions.

There is nothing in the video that would suggest the following is not accurate: 
&gt; The officers handcuffed Mr. Jaramillo and escorted him out the home so that they could investigate. Mr. Jaramillo tensed up and resisted. The officers explained to him that he was not under arrest and asked him to sit in a patrol car with his feet outside the car. Mr. Jaramillo refused and resisted. One of his hands became un-cuffed and Mr. Jaramillo continued resisting. Mr. Jaramillo fell to the ground where the officers were able to re-handcuff Mr. Jaramillo. While on the ground Mr. Jaramillo was screaming. Ms. Biocini and officers encouraged Mr. Jaramillo to relax. He stopped screaming and was breathing. The officers called an ambulance. Mr. Jaramillo was breathing. When the paramedics arrived, Mr. Jaramillo had become unresponsive. Mr. Jaramillo had a potentially lethal dose of cocaine in his system. The Coroner listed the cause of death as ""multiple drug intoxication associated with physical exertion.

With two and a half years of experience in patrol, I can say with certainty, restraining people who claim they are dieing is a weekly occurrence. They handled the situation perfectly. What do you people suppose the appropriate course of action was? Wait, let’s play a game first, since the people responding to this comment will likely have never done anything remotely similar to police work. Try to put yourself in the shoes of the cops. We will walk through it as it happened. I will break it down so it's easier to put yourselves in police perspective. Let’s see how you fare:

*The officers handcuffed Mr. Jaramillo and escorted him out the home so that they could investigate.*
So you respond to a possible burglary. Upon arrival, that's the only information you have. There is a man who is acting sporadic, your instincts and experience tells you that this person is *possibly* a suspect. Via textbook, this person needs to be detained. You use reasonable appropriate force to place him in handcuffs because it is imperative to officer and civilian safety. 

*Mr. Jaramillo tensed up and resisted. The officers explained to him that he was not under arrest and asked him to sit in a patrol car with his feet outside the car.*
He needs to be removed from the presence of other persons in order to prevent collaboration of stories. He is detained so a police car is the most reasonable and appropriate place. In order to be reasonable and keep the person calm, you explain the procedure and the fact that he is not under arrest, but he is detained. He resists anyways and is clearly concerned and under the influence of mind altering drugs, so in order to give him some solace, you allow him to leave his feet outside of the car. 

*Mr. Jaramillo refused and resisted. One of his hands became un-cuffed and Mr. Jaramillo continued resisting.*
He refuses to remain calm, and attempts to escape detainment. He defeats a handcuff and you reapply it. The situation is unsafe and not under complete control.
*Mr. Jaramillo fell to the ground where the officers were able to re-handcuff Mr. Jaramillo. While on the ground Mr. Jaramillo was screaming. Ms. Biocini and officers encouraged Mr. Jaramillo to relax. He stopped screaming and was breathing. The officers called an ambulance. Mr. Jaramillo was breathing. When the paramedics arrived, Mr. Jaramillo had become unresponsive. Mr. Jaramillo had a potentially lethal dose of cocaine in his system. The Coroner listed the cause of death as ""multiple drug intoxication associated with physical exertion.*

He is now on the ground and actively trying to escape. It is your duty to prevent him from doing so. The only way to keep someone detained who is actively resisting without beating them into submission is to simply hold them on the ground. This is an every-day occurrence. He is screaming for a solid four minutes saying he is dieing and that he can't breathe. Well if he can inhale, and then exhale, then he can breathe. You maintain control of him, but deliberately avoid impeding his ability to breathe while telling him to calm down. You call rescue because at this point, this person is clearly on serious drugs and could be overdosing or in excited delirium. You hold him until rescue arrives, and then allow the medical professionals to do their jobs.

What was done wrong? What should have been done differently? What were alternative options? Please think long and hard about the consequences of any proposed answers. And only utilize information that was available to the cops at the time of the incident.

It sounds to me like he died of excited delirium. Nothing the cops or paramedics could have done to save him.

"Preface: I do not agree with this, but you asked:

The idea is that for these high school kids (ages 14-18) this is their first job.  As high schoolers they lack any and all marketable skills. They need training. They will make (sometimes costly) mistakes. And in general they also lack dedication and duty and are more likely to quit on the spot or be no-shows when you need them. 
 
From the perspective of the business, especially a mom-and-pop type store, they're taking a *huge* risk on hiring a teenager for a summer job.  They may end up losing money because of the teenager (lack of actual work from them because of time spent training, time spent correcting their mistakes, time spent making up for their no-shows).  

The idea is, then, to provide an incentive to these smaller businesses to *actually bother hiring teenagers* for summer jobs when they may decide ""we'll manage without"" or ""we'll hire an adult.""  

In reality this just means stores like walmart, who do not need an incentive to hire teenagers for summer jobs, will get away with paying kids less. 

**Edit - The reason why I disagree with the above explanation, since people have asked:**

As other's have pointed out below... At present the United States has allowed the ""American Minimum Wage"" to become a ""Training Wage"" due to years of not keeping up with ~~inflation~~ [The cost of living](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/439mr8/eli5what_has_changed_in_the_last_40_years_so_that/czgjx4h) (Point of interest, the minimum wage [used to be considered a living wage](https://thebillfold.com/it-was-always-supposed-to-be-a-living-wage-a6d4cf3c7ab1#.o1hrogrpd)). At present the American Minimum Wage exists for inexperienced and low skilled workers and teenagers. Adults are not supposed to be seeking out minimum wage jobs as their full time career to make a living (at least not anymore), and yet that is where our economy has left us.

The problem is that we now have desperate adults willing to take minimum wage jobs and employers taking advantage of that, not that teens are teens.

So in theory, if America were to change the minimum wage to a ""living wage"" and have it tied to economic factors and increase with inflation to always remain a ""living wage"" *only then* would it make sense to establish some sort of ""Training Wage"" as is used in other countries.  

**TL;DR** We should not be lowering the bar for teenagers and unskilled labor because so many adults are now desperate enough to take minimum wage. We should be fixing the problem that adults can't find wages higher than what was formerly exclusively reserved for teenagers and unskilled labor. ",747
"&gt; One of the most interesting things I learned is that the block you live on is your gang. It's not so much that the kids ""turn to"" gangs, but rather that they're in the gangs just for living in their particular block. Choice isn't a part of it. There's one kid who eschews gangs completely, but it's at the cost of having no friends or social relations to speak of. Just keeping his head down and being busy with books 24/7 for his entire adolescence.

Holy fuck, finally someone that actually knows what they're talking about!

It is exactly this, the majority of the youth simply don't necessarily want to be in a gang. It's forced upon them by the block they live on. For example the block I lived on was run by the MC's (Micky Cobras) and it was pretty much decided when I came of age (12-13) that I was already an MC. If you don't join the gang you are seriously endangering your own life since you won't have any ""protection"" from rival gangs. 

After I Grew up a bit though (14-16) I realized that the gang life wasn't for me and that I wanted better for myself. This was probably the hardest thing I did to be completely honest. After you leave the gang NOBODY will want to associate with you. Literally all my friends and their parents on my block and surrounding blocks stopped talking to me and my family simply because I didn't want to be an MC anymore. For a kid like me it was awful, I didn't get how me choosing education/future over gangbanging was such a bad thing, but to them it was a serious betrayal.",544

"Umm for everyone going bonkers;

She COULD be fined ~~58~~ 72 USD for carrying an illegal weapon, in this case Pepper Spray. Mace is legal and can be used in self defense, unfortunately pepper spray is not. It is still unclear that she will be fined for that amount or not. So everyone is being outraged about something that hasn't even happened. 

~~really downvoting facts? hahah very nice worldnews very nice.~~ 

Final Edit: 

Potential reason why Denmark decided to make Pepper Spray illegal:
&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray
&gt;Although considered a less-than-lethal agent, it has been deadly in rare cases, and concerns have been raised about a number of deaths where being pepper sprayed may have been a contributing factor.

/u/PhotoQuig :
&gt; Basically pepper spray is derived from actual peppers. Mace is most commonly made from the compound Oleoresin Capsicum, which is why it's also known as OC spray, and carries more of the effect that CS (tear) gas does. As for which one would be worse, some people are completely immune to OC and CS, such as myself. Pepper spray makes me cough up a lung.
SOURCE: I'm an armed security contractor, I carry a full duty belt.

My final words about this:
&gt; Most likely the victim will not be fined but will have her pepper spray confiscated as the police don't usually care about such minor issues and the bigger picture is to provide support and find the criminal who tried to rape her. People here should take a bit of a chill pill and learn to look at issues beyond the black and white, so much anger and hate in some of you people. Ask yourself if that anger is helping you make the world better in any way? Be pragmatic be realistic and be honest with yourself if you dont know the full facts.

This was the norm for my wife and her brothers (aside from the break-in). Metal hangers, boards, belts or whatever their mom could get her hands on the quickest.

My wife told me a story once where she had to iron her mom's favorite shirt. She was 5. Well, she burned straight threw the sheer-like material as soon as the iron touched the shirt. So she did what any mother-fearing kid would do. She hid the shirt. Mom comes home asking for the shirt so she can go dancing but gets no answer from her daughter. So her mom grabs a metal hanger and asks again and again while hitting this 5 year old girl in the head, back and arms that were trying to fend off the attacks. So my wife says it's outside in the shed. Mom tells her to go get it. She goes outside and runs to the neighbors house while bleeding from her head wound(s), in which the cops are called.

This would go on for several more years until Child Protective Services finally get off their asses and place these kids into foster care when her and her siblings are 10, 11 and 12.

"That's the advice for any active shooter situation.  You run, and get as far away as fast as you can.  If you can't run (i.e. the exit is either covered by a gunman or otherwise can't be reached safely) you hide.  You hide as quietly as possible in as hard to access of an area as you can create.  Lights off, doors closed, locked, barricaded, and secured.  If you can't hide (i.e. there's nowhere to hide or nowhere safe to hide) you arm yourself with anything heavy, blunt, sharp, etc. you can find, whether it's a kitchen knife or a baseball bat or a wooden panel, and you prepare to fight.  If you're lucky, you can do it by hiding next to a doorway and striking if the overconfident gunman strolls in.  You fight to kill.  You don't stop attacking until the threat is incapacitated.  Contrary to human instinct, if a gunman enters a room with 20 people, he is at the physical disadvantage, not you.  Unfortunately, human instinct among the 20 people is usually ""play dead"" or ""beg"" or to simply freeze and cower.  The reaction instead should be let's get this asshole, and charge him.  A gun is not a superweapon.  It's very easy for 20 people to overpower one gunman, and while it seems like suicide to run at a gun, 20 people running at a workplace or school gunman have a much higher chance of surviving a close quarters fight with him than they do if they simply sit there or drop down.

""But if I attack him, surely I'll get shot!  Even if ten of us charge a guy with a Glock, at least five of us will die!""  Not so.  Let's use the Reagan assassination attempt as an example.  Yes, the men who brought down the shooter were trained professionals.  But they did it the same way you would: they heard the shots, they flinched, but then they immediately and instinctively attacked the gunman.  They took him to the ground unarmed, and using the overwhelming advantage of numbers. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoZeZprXnDg

Would this have been harder if he had a semi automatic rifle rather than a pistol?  Yes. Would the technique have changed?  Probably not.  It was faster and safer to dive on the gunman than to shoot back.  They took him down without a single additional casualty.

It's also important to remember that even though the gunman was mere feet from his target, and even though he hit who he was aiming for, and even though he hit additional victims, he didn't kill any of them despite his overwhelming advantage of surprise.  No reason you and your coworkers, or you and the other folks at the mall, or wherever you are when this happens, can't fight back too.

Ugh, that's barbaric. Only a tiny minority of Muslims think that way. The majority of the rest just think that it's a woman's fault for being raped, that woman have the burden of curbing men's sexual desires (unless it's their husband), and that jail is a suitable punishment for free speech they don't like, or apostasy.

EDIT: Yes, I'm being facetious--sort of. A large portion of 3rd world (key qualifier there!) Muslims have some backassward beliefs relative to Westerners.

"&gt; Unless his viewpoint contradicts the constitution, and then it's objectively just wrong.

**The Supreme Court is literally the legal body that decides _by interpretation_ what viewpoints codified into law do and do not comport with the Constitution's framework**


There isn't any right to an abortion in the Constitution - - go look for it. The Founders weren't thinking about it. No one was thinking about it.

It has *nothing* to do with our Constitutional framework.......*except* when it comes to interpreting whether or not the government can make law regarding it, you have to start talking about the private medical decisions made in confidence between an individual and their doctor. 

Can government override due process on privacy, protected by the 14th (not 4th amendment in this instance) amendment?  Does it have a legitimate state interest in curtailing those rights, interfering with an abortion? Does that interest exist in *as* compelling a way at conception as they do one hour before delivery? 

*That's* really what was at issue in *Roe v. Wade*, not whether life exists at conception or at a third trimester, or whatever else.

The SCOTUS said, hey, until fetal viability, you can't just ban abortions, even elective ones, because you'd be granting the State far too much power to deny Due Process and private medical practice between an individual and their doctor.

They *interpreted* the Constitution - - - there's nothing objective about the subjective duty of judges.



That's literally the reason we have them, and why we have the idea of lifetime appointments by the Executive, approved by the Legislature, so that we have a broad number of viewpoints, never have single party control, and so that we have great swathes of the public sentiment ultimately being responsible for who gets to the SCOTUS.

The notion a Supreme Court Justice would have a viewpoint that ""contradicts"" the Constitution, and could be ""objectively"" wrong flies in the very face of what the Constitution and the whole frame work of Constitutional law is all about.

They're literally Supreme *Judges* who exercise judgement.

______________________


Same with *Obergefell*.

Yeah, yeah, Anthony Kennedy writing for the majority did the same thing the SCOTUS decision of *Loving* did in the 60s, where they wrote at some length about how it's fun to be in love and wheeee! marriage is adorable and sacred, blah blah blah.

Marriage isn't anywhere in the Constitution.

The real issue at hand isn't the feelings of whites, blacks, or gays as they relate to marriage, for and against.

Those are just a byproduct of a much more sober, much more serious legal reality up for dispute:

*Can* or *cannot* State or Federal governments ignore the 14th Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection clauses.

It's not just marriage rights (to be clear: yes, I think equal marriage rights are important and marriage is wonderful and all that shit) - - it's **fucking everything**

Will there be Due Process or not? 

Will we have representative Republican Democracy constrained by the assent of the people?

Yes, or no?

Where law is applied in course of our assent to governance with a formal legal process and done so equally? 
Yes, or no?

Do we have a government of by and for the people?

Yes, or no?



*That* kind of deep legal structure, the sort of thing that makes people line up in front of a wooden bridge or on a village green with muskets in hand ready to shoot dead troops of their lawful government which is acting in a manner that does not protect their life, liberty, and happiness, which the Constitution is supposed to protect and give form to, so that we can settle disputes and create policies with pen and paper, and not grapeshot and ball.

The notion that we should look on Scalia having particularly religious and traditional views, be upset with him, and wish his replacement with someone that more easily rubberstamps our own sentiments instead of requiring the heavy labor of Representative Lawmakers and a Representative Executive suggesting, fighting over, and agreeing to appoint people of different ideological perspective is *appalling*.

Our entire political framework from limits on the Executive, the staggering and bifurcating of the Legislature, and the ideological heterodoxy of the Judiciary is **on purpose**

It's literally set up this way to ensure no one gets 100% of what they want **ever** without it being figured out and settled by formal process.

(Ignoring ATM fees.)

EDIT:  One thing that many have pointed out is that people should still have some sort of personal responsibility regarding their personal finances, and that is absolutely true.  However, sometimes things like auto-charges that are set up of billing mistakes can occur that weren't accounted for or outside of someone's control.  The way that overdraft fees are handled take advantage of the vulnerable.  For example, if something happens and you go below 0 for whatever reason and don't realize it, every time you use your card after that you'll accrue another fee.  You can accrue hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees for making small purchases, and the bank usually doesn't notify you until later.  If you realize that you did and deposit money back in too late in the day, then the banks 'can't process' it and you'll get hit with more fees.  I used to work in a branch bank and I know exactly how fucked up that system can be.

EDIT 2:  I'd like to recommend credit unions over banks.  Sometimes less convenient, but always will be more on your side.  Better interest rates.  Etc. You should at least swing by one and check it out, and see if they'll be able to fill your financial needs.  They're almost always better for you than the banks.  Source: Work at banks.",396

Then the time will come when they want two pieces of candy and they learn that they can't pay for both with their one dollar, and so they have to choose. That's when they start to understand its value and you explain that if they save their money this week and don't get a candy, next week they can buy two candies.

Most kids just buy the candy, but the lesson eventually gets learned because kids always want a second piece of candy and you can always remind them of the lesson.

"It's true poverty and institutional racism affects or has affected blacks in the US.  In such way, it's important for society to acknowledge these things in order to move past them.

That said, a huge problem with black America is there is no cultural feedback loop, a trait successful cultures possess.  As a result of white guilt, the rest of society has catered too much to the demands of SJW/black radicals without question.  There is little diversity of thought being promoted within the black community due to the preacherman 'the truth' rhetorical approach that gets promoted.  At one point, this may have been useful in the past (and to an extent, it still is).  However, just like you can't always bomb your way to victory despite success in previous wars, you can't always rely on protests and rhetorical shouting to gain political victory.....especially when your goal is to raise political awareness and/or connect with other groups.

Otherwise, the result is a mass glob that is incapable of socially complimenting other ethnic groups within the US because they are either always right and/or the victim.  Whereas, in reality, there needs to be a two way street for a culture to thrive.  Because cultural isolation will force the community to tear itself apart from within.  Black on black violence/crime, education shaming, heavy glorification of crime/sex/drugs, and poor health/money/food habits are way bigger threats than all the ""white privilege"" and police abuse.

People say to pour money and I can only partially-agree.  But similar to how many impoverished athletes go broke after making it to the big leagues, more money is only going to lead to a system that goes nowhere.  There needs to be a balanced and slow approach.  It requires a *cultural shift* from within.

Unfortunately, promoting something like this in academia or politics is career suicide.  The potential black people that want actual change won't get to hear anything other than the same propaganda that gets spewed to them.  Until a real black leader or movement can rise up out of these current circumstances and in rebellion to the old way (something whites did against themselves plenty of times to make actual changes), the black community in the US will suffer.",238

When you commit 6 times more violent crime and twice as much murder then any other race, you know there's a problem.

This is the main cause.  44% of black familes have no contact with their dads what so ever.  I'll wager  that some have inconsistant contact with their fathers and only a few remain a constant presence in their lives.
This is the truth. These are the stats. Anyone in london, manchester, birmingham knows this. Stop being politically correct, you are making it worse.

"It's explained in one of his video descriptions why he believed the police were harassing him. 

&gt;...I've been saying this since 2009 when I discovered Law Enforcement Agencies in Fresno were scanning license plates in retail parking lots of SaveMart, Vons, Home Depot, and others looking for expired tags and other small infractions. Fresno cops would set up a sting where the unsuspecting shopper would be pulled over two or three blocks from where they were shopping so they would have no clue their vehicle was actually scanned in a private parking lot. I brought this to the attention of the Mayor's office and Fresno PD in 2009 and later. They then figured out where I lived and started harassing and following me everywhere, and worse. To this day I am on their ""bad guy"", slash ""troublemaker"", slash ""whistleblower"" list and I feel their presence constantly.

Most of his videos, in the description, read:

&gt; I am being targeted by multiple City of Fresno departments and the Fresno Sheriff's Office for comments I made on the Fresno Bee from 2009 to 2013. Comments that were critical of the way Fresno PD and Fresno Fire utilized their budgets. My Disqus handle during that time was ""John21"". Posters on the Fresno Bee, using the then Disqus comment system were suppose to be anonymous. However, Fresno Bee employee Jody Murray shared Fresno Bee log data and ip address information with Jared L McCormick, a Fresno Sheriff Sergeant, who then used the Fresno Bee provided information to retrieve name and address information in order to maliciously track-down, stalk, and harass Fresno Bee comment posters, including myself. McCormick's Disqus handle on the Bee was ""Hikerdude1967"". I notified Jim Boren, the then Fresno Bee Editor via email on two occasions in 2013 regarding an employee at the Bee who was sharing website ip and log data of Fresno Bee commenters with Fresno PD and Fresno Sheriff personnel. I explained in these emails that as a result of Jody Murray's nefarious efforts Fresno Bee commenters were subsequently stalked and harassed by Fresno Law Enforcement. I never received a reply from from Mr. Boren on either occasion. However, consequently, I have been made a constant target of harassment, intimidation, and worse by multiple City of Fresno Departments and the Fresno Sheriff's office.

[The Intercept: Blowing the Whistle on CIA Torture from Beyond the Grave](https://theintercept.com/2014/10/17/blowing-whistle-cia-torture-beyond-grave/)

[Torture &amp; The War on Terror: James Risen Exposes the Whistle-Blower That Wasn't](http://www.thetakeaway.org/story/james-risen-torture/)

&gt;Investigative reporter James Risen has spent years exposing the dark underbelly of the War on Terror. And in his latest book, ""Pay any Price: Greed, Power and Endless War,"" Risen tells the troubling story of a man named Scott Gerwehr.

&gt;Gerwehr, a RAND corporation researcher, was essentially given permission to experiment on Iraq and Afghan detainees with behavioral science techniques—techniques that were designed to elicit information. 

&gt;Risen says that Gerwehr had intricate knowledge of American detention and torture systems, and the close collaboration between American psychologists and the national security establishment. Gerwehr wanted to come forward as a whistle-blower, but died before he had a chance.

I probably should have notified police but rather we took him to the mall in search of his mother. We checked every store after we got him some Dairy Queen, and she was nowhere to be found. He escaped my hand hold and ran away from me. We were able to find him again and I immediately called the police who had had previous and multiple run ins with this child being alone and wandering. They were very familiar with his parents and the situation, and she did not work at the mall. Perhaps he wanted a ride there for some reason? I watched him drive away in the cruiser, got into my car, and wept. I don't know why I'm sharing this but it was so concerning to me that this type of situation is considered normal.

We outnumber cops hundreds to one and if they want to start shooting, see how far that gets them. If they want to start beating on innocent protesters, hold them down, take our taxpayer funded batons and beat them back.

Hell I'll make it easy on those internal review guys so they don't screw this up again. 

In Conneticut-


3.3-1  Conspiracy -- § 53a-48 (a)
The statute defining conspiracy reads in pertinent part as follows:

A person is guilty of conspiracy when, with the intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, (he/she) agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.

--------------------------------------------------------------

So what's the [crime]( http://law.justia.com/codes/connecticut/2005/title53a/sec53a-180.html)?

2005 Connecticut Code - Sec. 53a-180. Falsely reporting an incident in the first degree: Class D felony.

--------------------------------------------------------------

The Feds better be moving on this ad well as they clearly violated some federal statutes as [well]( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983).

Specifically I'm an idiot as was pointed out below. 




18 U.S. Code § 241 - Conspiracy against rights

And

18 U.S. Code § 242 - Deprivation of rights under color of law

Would be the applicable federal statutes for their alleged crimes. 



Title 42 Section 1983 - would be the civil code that would allow the victim to seek compensation. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

Class D felonies carry 1-5 years in Conneticut, so I'm sure we will see these guys in prison uniforms before we see then in police uniforms again right guys?",185

"If anyone wants a brief summary of the Hammond's case I wrote one up for a different thread:

In 2001 the family takes illegal deer and then to try and cover it up they commit arson, setting fires on federal land. Steven Hammond handed out “Strike Anywhere” matches with instructions that they be lit and dropped on the ground because they were going to “light up the whole country on fire.” The fire consumed 139 acres of public land and destroyed all evidence of the game violations. 

Then in 2006 they started more fires when there was a fire ban in effect due to dangerous conditions for fire. Despite the ban, without permission or notification to BLM, Steven Hammond started several “back fires” in an attempt save the ranch’s winter feed.  The fires burned onto public land and were seen by BLM firefighters camped nearby.  The firefighters took steps to ensure their safety and reported the arsons.

These guys got to have a trial, were judged by a jury of their peers, and convicted. Because the fires burned up federal land they faced federal charges. The minimum sentence for their crime is five years according federal sentencing law. The trial court tried to get around that and gave out a lesser sentence but the government appealed and eventually the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the federal law, reasoning that “given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.”  

In March 2015 the Supreme Court denied the Hammond's petition and that was that. The Hammonds received their five year sentence with credit for time served. They deserve every year of it, considering this isn't the first illegal fire they've set on federal lands. 

Of course the occupation really has nothing to do with the Hammond's case, it was just a convenient excuse for these mentally unhinged domestic terrorists to try and get their civil war going before their biggest rallying cry of ""Obummer secret Muslim tryin' ta overthrow the gubment"" goes away next November.

But we're not carrying our own water quality sensors yet. We've got to start doing that, be it through a new sensor in a phone or some novel technique. You don't actually need 1M people in a city to test their own water, even just 1,000 would do. 

And it's not just water tests; we need to stop trusting corrupt governments and corporations to tell us what's best. Watch Coke and Pepsi win big from this because they sell bottled water. Not suggesting that they are behind this conspiracy, but, this kind of corruption is disgusting and can lead to really bad incentives. 

And combine this with VW cheating in their vehicle emissions tests! This is a pattern that is just now open to the public eyes. We need crowdsourcing technology for our food (did you see that story about Chipotle trying to cover up their potential Norovirus problem?), for our air (see VW), for our water (see Flint, and all these cities).

I'm making crowdsourcing apps that use sensors in phones to detect things like earthquakes, weather (see [Sunshine](https://thesunshine.co)), magnetic pole shifts, and everything else I can to put these technologies directly in the hands of people instead of corporate/government agencies. But how do we solve the problems with air, water, food quality, at scale? We don't have cheap sensors for that yet.",130

"When it comes to nukes in the 21st century, size doesn't matter. At least not in the way you might think it does.

If you look at the history of nuclear testing, the earliest tests are generally the largest in yield for their weapon type.

Within 8 years of [the first nuclear test ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_%28nuclear_test%29), the [Soviet Union had detonated its first bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDS-1), and the US detonated the [largest fission weapon ever designed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_King). 

The [first Teller-Ulam fusion device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Mike) was detonated in 1952. Within 10 years, the Soviets detonated [the largest fusion weapon ever tested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba).

Once the dick-measuring contest of the 1950's subsided, people began to realize that the most effective weapon didn't need to make the loudest bang.  It needed to have a high yield-to-weight ratio, and it needed to be mounted on a highly accurate delivery system... preferably as one re-entry vehicle among many on the same rocket.  Efforts focused on miniaturization and the accuracy of delivery systems.

Now I feel like BLM is just driving a wedge between racial differences.

""The blame game"" which is counterproductive to tackling issues at hand. Martin Luther King himself said that justice needs to be demanded from the oppressor, he also spoke against distrusting all white people. So if oppression is to be fought, how can peaceful revolution occur when people aren't willing to sit in the same table of brotherhood to compromise working solutions for the problems at hand?

**Prologue:**
Cliven Bundy is a rancher from Nevada that was involved in an armed standoff with the federal government. There was a long standing fight about the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) denying ranchers what they, the ranchers, thought was their right to let their cattle graze on government land. Bundy felt that he didn't have to pay the tax for letting his cattle graze on the land so he stopped paying it back in the 1990s. The feds said they were going to impound his cattle for the $1+ million debt to the government. Many ranchers called this a major overreach by the feds and it gathered support of many far right conservatives. Some went so far as to show up armed and prepared to fight the federal government. The federal government did get a court order to impound the cattle, however, the BLM decided to not enforce the order: ""Based on information about conditions on the ground, and in consultation with law enforcement, we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public.""

More detailed story is here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/04/15/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-fight-between-cliven-bundy-and-the-federal-government/ and here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff

*****

**Chapter 1: The Arsonists**

Some ranchers made a fire that spread to BLM land. They also set a fire to destroy evidence of deer poaching. The federal government charged them with arson and managed to get a conviction. They were sentenced and served the sentenced issued initially. It was less than the mandatory minimum. The appeals court tells them to go back and serve the minimum sentence of 5 years. Cliven's sons calls on his army from his protest to show up and help protest these ranchers going to jail.

*****

**Chapter 2: The Bundys are Back!**

The Bundys gathered some of these protesters to take over a wildlife refuge in Oregon. They have said they plan on living there for years and have called on others to join them to fight. Someone who joined them has sent a ""goodbye video"" to his family. One has said ""I want to die a free man."" Rumor has it that there are over 100 armed fighters and they have stockpiled supplies to survive.

*****

**Chapter 3: A Bundy Speaks**

One of the sons have posted a video to their Facebook page and outlined that they are protesting the federal government putting the people in poverty by regulating the natural resources they need for their businesses. They also said that if they do not stand up now they might not be able to in the future. He also stated he did not want to cause anyone harm and confirmed that they are armed.

If you want to see the video it is on the Bundy Ranch facebook page.

I've always found it interesting that Michael's car isn't going that fast when he runs the red light. He started accelerating a lot more after the first part of this video.

It's a law change from 2001, the relevant bit is this:

&gt;Behandling av känsliga uppgifter

&gt;5 § Uppgifter om en person får inte behandlas enbart på grund
av vad som är känt om personens ras eller etniska ursprung,
politiska åsikter, religiösa eller filosofiska övertygelse,
medlemskap i fackförening, hälsa eller sexualliv.

&gt;Om uppgifter om en person behandlas på annan grund får
uppgifterna kompletteras med sådana uppgifter som avses i
första stycket, om det är absolut nödvändigt för syftet med
behandlingen.

&gt;Personuppgifter enligt första stycket får inte användas som
sökbegrepp om inte regeringen har föreskrivit det. Sådana
föreskrifter får meddelas endast för det ändamål som anges i 3 § första stycket.

And heres a crude google translation:

&gt;Treatment of sensitive information

&gt;5 § Information about a person shall not be treated solely on the basis of what is known about the person's race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical belief, membership to trade unions, health or sexual life.

&gt;If information about a person is treated on different basis may be supplemented by the information referred to in first paragraph if it is absolutely necessary for the purpose of treatment.

&gt;Personal information under the first paragraph may not be used search term unless the Government has prescribed it. Such Regulations may be issued only for the purpose mentioned in § 3, first paragraph.

"&gt;This is the reason why I'm okay with a social safety net.

The American idea of the noble poor. The implication of which is that the majority of the poor are *not* noble, and deserve to starve.

Poverty isnt about personal responsibility. It is a fact that a capitalist system will separate people into classes. The people in the lower classes cannot will themselves into the middle class, and even if they could, somebody would have to take their place. There are always going to be people at the bottom of the pile. 

There are only two ways to ensure those people can live lives to a standard that we would consider acceptable for our fellow man. The first is to have an economy that is so dependent on labour, particularly unskilled or low-skilled labour, that work is easy to find and well paid. America used to have this. The second is to have a robust economy that is *not* so dependent on labour, but is successful enough to carry a tax burden that can support the poor through welfare. America has this, but in my opinion, refuses to exploit the situation for maximum benefit. America *could* afford a greater tax burden, and *could* provide an acceptable standard of living for the poor. It fails to do so both because American society see's high wealth inequality as the natural, correct structure of human society, and because American society has a moral association with wealth. To be poor in America is treated as immoral. There are also racial undertones to Americas disdain for the poor.

We are so used to ""cooking"" meat at high temperatures - boiling water (212F/100C) or hotter on grills, in pans or in ovens, that we have a hard time grasping that the actual cooking of meat happens at much lower temperatures - we roast the shit  out of the outside of meat but you don't want the interior of a cut of beef to ever get hotter than about 140F/60C.  If you put a cut of beef (or a person) in a water/steam bath that's at 140F/60C for a few hours, they'll come out medium rare without the exterior being browned or showing any signs of burning like blistering.

An enjoyable hot shower is about 105F/40C.

The last 3 men asking for crowley was what finally made me get rid of our whole stock.
#1: skinny, snow pale 30ish dude in a leather duster/dresden hat in summer. Showed him crowley. Went back to my desk. 2 minutes later he sprints out of the store. I call the cops and report a theft then go check what we lost. 2 crowleys and a 1st ed. Kerouac. 
#2: pungent smelling gothish couple. I show them to crowley but stick around 'shelving' near them. After about 5 minutes they get into a heated argument about some black magic point of order or something. Dude hauls off and slaps the chick. Full backhand. Right fucking next to me. And she just shuts up and goes back to reading. I ask them to leave, trying not to get involved (i know but the fuck am i supposed to do). He starts throwing books and slaps the chick again like its her fault. I headlock him and toss him out then call the cops since he just stands outside throwing rocks at my building. 
#3: dude (normal enough looking) browses around for about 15min. Brings 2 crowleys, a kalil gibran, a few edgar case paperbacks, and a salvador dali monograph to my desk apparantly to check out. Steps back a bit and pulls his sweater up so i can see his .38 snubnose. Says im taking these and walks out. I call the cops, they find him, i press charges. 3 months later and i Still havent gotten my fucking books back. 
So i know this is not representitive of all crowley readers (i even own a couple personal copies) but 3 instances in 5 months is, to me, an unacceptable risk. Im mostly just glad it was me all three times and not the 100lb college girl i have working for me. ",127

"As I wrote in another thread:

Forget the classification of any email period. Everyone is focused on the wrong issue.

You know what is ludicrous? She had a personal email server at home, that had over 1,000 emails that could be construed as sensitive.

http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/a-guide-to-hillary-clintons-most-sensitive-emails-121693

You know what is the first thing they tell you on day one at any classified or unclass govt job? No external hardware or software on the NIPR or SIPR (basically the unclass and classified systems that are used by govt computers and devices).

Just the fact she had a server at home that had JWICS/SIPR/NIPR information is a giant fucking violation (that better?). Anyone else but Hillary would be either facing a court martial or indictment.

**Edit:** here's an example: http://www.gordon.army.mil/garrison_old/nec/documents/FG_AUP-Feb-14Now.pdf

On pg 3 of 7...(DoS follows nearly the same rules) - ""e. I will use only authorized hardware and software on the DoD/Army networks to include wireless technology. I will not install or use any personally owned hardware (including removable drives), software, shareware, or public domain software.""

**Edit 2:** And I'm not going to just call out Hillary for this - if any DoS official knew she had this server and continued to send emails to her they are also in violation of the law and should be prosecuted. 

**Edit 3:** The point I was making was not about Hillary hooking up directly to the NIPR or SIPR (which there is no evidence of, and no chance of that happening). Rather, as a government employee (and a career politician), she should know better than to use private devices dealing with either NIPR/SIPR/JWICS information, as seems to be the case with many of these emails.

**Edit 4:** As an equal opportunity hater, what Petraeus did was abominable as well. He got 2 years probation and $100k in fines for disseminating JWICS info to a person with a TS but who did not have access to that info. If only I could gut the government like the second coming of Ron Swanson.

**Edit 5:** A good point was brought up that by hosting it privately, she could skirt FOIA requests (public vs private domain). It would also violate NARA inadvertently (because the email couldn't readily be accessed). 

**Edit 6:** As some are pointing out, emails weren't classified when they were sent/received. With that said, Hillary was responsible to safeguard any information she may think has sensitive information on it, and report it to the proper authorities. It is her responsibility to mark classified info or any information that she even thinks is privileged. Information does not need to be ""marked"" classified in order for it to BE classified.

And people can stop with the ""and Colin Powell did it too!"" spiel. The State Department in October 2014 sent letters to three other previous secretaries: Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. Only Powell used personal email for official business. None of them had their own servers.

http://www.factcheck.org/2015/08/clintons-email-brag/

**Edit 7:** She has at least violated NARA, and most likely 18 U.S. Code § 1924 - Unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material. 

NARA has been around since 2009. Before she was Sec.

"For the record, I agree that animals should not be used for live entertainment and that I'm an animal lover myself. The treatment the girls received in our company was always top notch however. Better than the employees, proportionally speaking. Constant care and companionship. Any time they were shackled it was for their own safety to act as a guide, and they could easily break the restraints should they need to. Restraints usually on train runs where they were let out for fresh air and baths/hay to play in periodically. 

You should hear how excited they get right before they go onstage. Their ""tricks"" are things you can witness them doing in the wild for fun, and the crowds awe and cheer the moment they come through the portal. 

Some of their trainers/handlers are truly gifted with them. We're talking about people extremely passionate and dedicated to their well being. 

And PETA... good god I don't know where to begin about those guys. I will say however that the general lack of understanding about this issue is propagated by them. 

There are totally bad circuses, and there's totally a moral dilemma with using animals for live entertainment. Personally, I'd like to see it phased out completely. However I don't believe it should be now and in this manner. These animals are going to have a huge stressful adjustment to make. It'd be more humane to just stop bringing new ones into the circus life and allow the existing girls to retire out with the relationships they've already formed with their handlers.

The ivory tower folk at the University of Michigan didn't care about us and their satellite campus UM-Flint was towing the government line.

January 13th, 2015:

&gt; Both the City and the Genesee County Health Department have reassured citizens that it is safe to use city water and that corrective actions are not necessary. Regular testing of the water supply continues to take place to ensure usability and consumption is safe for citizens.  The City has indicated that there is nothing individuals need to do unless you have a severely compromised immune system, have an infant, or are elderly.  In that case, they recommend that you may be at an increased risk and should seek advice about the drinking water from your health care provider.

&gt; The University will be conducting monthly tests of the water that is used on campus. If there are any issues that are found as a result of the testing, that information will be communicated to the campus.

&gt; Generally speaking, there are no immediate actions that need to be taken by individuals regarding the safety of water in the City. In conversations that the UM-Flint Office of Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) has had with the Genesee County Health Department, there are  a few recommendations that one might follow if concerned about total trihalomethanes (TTHMs):

&gt; 1. Use bottled water or

&gt; 2. Install point-of-use home water treatment systems on delivery lines in the house (faucet mount, pour through pitcher style, and plumbed-in units)

&gt; 3. It is important to note that when selecting/purchasing any water filter device that it is certified by National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or the Water Quality Association (WQA) to remove TTHMs (look for the seals on the box). The filters could be a pitcher style or a point of use treatment filter that can be mounted to the faucet, under the sink or on the counter top. These treatment devices are widely available for purchase at houseware or hardware stores.

&gt; If you have further questions, the EHS in collaboration with our campus student environmental club, Future Urban &amp; Environment Leaders (F.U.E.L.) plan to host a brownbag luncheon discussion in the near future.  All faculty, students, and staff are welcome to attend. Additionally, please feel free to contact the City of Flint or the County Health Department directly, if you so choose. 

https://www.umflint.edu/ehs/campus-water-quality-updates

I don't got a fancy degree, but those aren't things you need to be doing unless your water is messed up.

Sincerely,

A pissed off Flint man.

(A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;  
(B) appear to be intended—  
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;  
(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or

Edit: One interesting way of measuring inflation in the US is looking at the wages of enlisted army privates entering military service; like looking at the Big Mac Index, it's a very basic basket of goods, a unit of uneducated, untrained labor and how much they are willing to compensate for it -- and even switching from compulsory to volunteer force, you can still see some value from it. For example, during the civil war, they were paid $13 to $16 per month -- totalling roughly $175 a year. Now, they are paid roughly $18,300 a year. You can see from this, the difference is roughly 104.5 times as much money. Which would make $25 in 1865 equivalent to roughly $2,600 today. This is just another way of looking at it.",250

&gt; The officers handcuffed Mr. Jaramillo and escorted him out the home so that they could investigate. Mr. Jaramillo tensed up and resisted. The officers explained to him that he was not under arrest and asked him to sit in a patrol car with his feet outside the car. Mr. Jaramillo refused and resisted. One of his hands became un-cuffed and Mr. Jaramillo continued resisting. Mr. Jaramillo fell to the ground where the officers were able to re-handcuff Mr. Jaramillo.
While on the ground Mr. Jaramillo was screaming. Ms. Biocini and officers encouraged Mr. Jaramillo to relax. He stopped screaming and was breathing. The officers called an ambulance. Mr. Jaramillo was breathing. When the paramedics arrived, Mr. Jaramillo had become unresponsive. Mr. Jaramillo had a potentially lethal dose of cocaine in his system.

The alternate explanation, that there are thousands of people who decided to commit sexual assault *spontaneously*, without coordination, is hardly less troubling.

"I know a lot of people are saying ""don't spend what you don't have, etc"" but the real shitty fact here is that the banks charge random fees to the customers while offering us basically zero interest on our money. At the same time that they aren't paying us anything, they use our money to invest for themselves and are still raking in billions in profit. We are giving the banks free loans and are segeing zero return on our money.  

THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is the real issue.  

Edit: I know what the Fed is, people. I have an MBA with a focus in finance. I probably understand it better than most of the people commenting about it. The Fed has been actively colluding with the banking industry to keep rates low since the financial crisis 8 years ago while the markets have not only recovered completely, but are at record highs. The freaking DOW is nearly 10,000 points higher than it was in '07-'08.   

There is no reason rates should still be basically zero. The rates were lowered in an effort to help banks out of bad situations. The bad situations are gone and the Fed is still giving nearly free money to the banks.  Banks could completely cut fees for consumers altogether and STILL be rolling in cash, but they know they have us by the balls because it's dumb as hell to keep jars full of cash buried in your backyard.  And I'm not talking about overdraft fees, I'm talking about fees for not having over X dollars in your account monthly, or not having direct deposit, or not transferring X dollars to a savings account monthly. It's a tax on the poor when you tell people living paycheck to paycheck that they owe you $15 per month for not having over $1000 in their checking account at all times.

Part of the story has to be missing. People sometimes get pissy when they find out that you have to file a CTR and a CTR also requires some prodding questions so maybe he was being shitty about that? Or maybe it was a big misunderstanding? Definitely need more details.

1. Yes. Most bank branches don't have $200K to use for withdrawals because they only have so much cash reserves. However, given the location of this branch it is very possible they had that much in reserves.

"Right.  The article, in a roundabout way, is talking about the actual levels of lead in children's blood, which can come from a variety of sources.  In many ways, getting the lead in drinking water close to zero is the easiest (assuming you don't screw up like the state did in Flint.)  The problem is that the other sources are much more difficult to remediate and much more expensive, particularly in older towns where lead sources are widespread.

Other major sources are from materials in buildings, such as lead paint in the child's home, and even the soil in the yard, school yards, etc.  Paint on ""moving parts"" like doors, door frames, window sashes and window frames gets worn down into a fine powder that can be inhaled or ingested when it lands on surfaces inside the home and food.  Obviously, chipping lead paint is a problem.

But so is lead in the soil.  As old buildings are torn down or left to peel and fall apart, the lead in paint and other building parts (such as roof flashing, gutters, etc.) deteriorates and gets into the soil throughout the surrounding area.  At least one study as found that by testing kids in a neighborhood in Chicago that had a lot of old, deteriorating buildings, that the lead in the kids blood spiked during the summer, when they were outside playing more and when the soil was dryer and more prone to blowing around.  So the amount of lead in the soil in a neighborhood can definitely contribute to the overall lead in kids.

If lead got into the soil from industrial processes also, that would clearly make the situation that much worse.

It's also worth noting that the current level of concern 5 micrograms per deciliter of blood (μg/dL) - is somewhat controversial.  It was lowered from 10 μg/dL a few years ago, and while there is no known ""safe"" level, not everyone is convinced that we'll see actual improvements in kid's development or health as the result of lowering the threshold.

"Deserts are actually NOT the best place to have solar panels, they are sometimes very good, but not necessarily the best.

Let me elaborate: 

1. Thermal efficiency DECREASES with temperature increase. IE the panels produce less energy when they are hot. Sounds dumb, but that's physics. Why does this matter? Well, technically a cold climate is better than a hot one, all else equal. There are other factors to consider in cold climates, such as snowfall, but overall everything equal, cold is better.

2. There is not a lot of moisture in the desert. This means there is a lot of dust and dirt that will soil the panels. When designing systems this is one of many variables that is considered when estimating output of the panels. Long story short, no rain means higher soiling --&gt; less generation. Yes, you can clean and maintain the panels, but it comes at a cost.

3. Energy is best generated where it is used. Not a lot of people live in the middle of the desert ~~or in the mid-west in general.~~ If you have to transport it a long way, like across a desert, you will encounter transmission losses and infrastructure improvements will likely be necessary to transport large amounts of power over those distances. Once again, this increases the cost and lowers the efficiency of the overall system.

4. The COST of electricity in a given area is a HUGE factor. If you pay your utility $.06/kWh it is a LOT harder to compete with solar. If you pay your utility $.20/kWh it is a lot EASIER to compete with solar. Essentially: how does the $/kWh rate of solar in a given area compare with the $/kWh from the current utility. I am not sure about this particular areas cost of electricity, I am just trying to point out that overall this is a large factor in the competitiveness of solar. You can have an optimal site in every way, but if it is not cost competitive due to low utility rates, it is not going to be worth it anywhere.

5. Incentives. This is what is being focused on for most of the discussion. It is a huge factor and does lower costs and helps make solar more competitive. This is a huge debate in the world that I am not going to get into. I just wanted to make a note that yes, incentives (tax credits, net metering allowance, SREC's and other performance based incentives, tax shielding,etc) do make a difference in a substantial way.

Tl;DR: Saying ""deserts are the best place for solar"" is too much of a broad statement. A lot of discussion that goes on about Solar in general tends to be more political and for the most part consumers and politicians really do not understand a lot about what makes it happen. The only real connection most people make is that Sun + Panels = Energy. So the more sun, ~~the more energy.~~ the better a given location is for solar. I just wanted to point out for a number of reasons that this is not necessarily true. Thank you.

"Opium's pretty cheap, even in the amounts needed to be effective through oral administration, but that's not the only problem with this idea.

First, there's the taste problem, namely that opium isn't anywhere near flavorless - it's quite bitter, and would require an off-putting amount of spices to mask any kind of effective dose.  The food would, compared to unadulterated food, taste strange, off, or simply unpalatable.

Second, there's the return business problem.  People aren't going to get hooked after one, or even five, adulterated meals (or even necessarily link the opium euphoria with a dish they had at the restaurant in question, it takes some time to kick in, when ingested orally).  They'd almost have to be loyal customers already to consume enough of the adulterated food to develop dependence.

So at the end of the day you'd only end up hooking people who were loyal enough to regularly eat at your place without special enticement despite your food tasting like either drugs or whatever atypical spice concoction you ended up using to mask the drugs.

It might also be a good idea to try and fast for a few days every now and then, only consuming liquids, this will give your pancreas a break, which alcohol stresses out. 

Not being judgemental or anything, just letting you know so you don't get caught off guard. Make sure to drink lots of water and keep up your vitamin-A levels. (butternut squash soup is good for that)

Vitamin K is also important to a lesser extent, which you can get from dark leafy greens. 

Just gotta keep in mind that when you consume alcohol it causes depletion in some areas of your body so if you don't stay on top of that you can do more damage than need be.

What's hard for me to get my mind around is the extent to which this was both thought-through, and not thought-through at all.

What did these men expect would happen?  That a massive crush of somewhere between a hundred and a _thousand_ men, all with sticky fingers and hungry hands, would somehow go unnoticed?  A mob losing control is one thing, and its own form of disturbing, but this looks to be more and more a premeditated activity that possibly involved established criminal gangs.  Did they think they'd just get away with it - something on this scale?  Was no one aware or concerned that it would incite a backlash against the migrant and refugee communities - and if they did, did they consider the whole thing worth it, in order to cop a feel?

My best guess is that the idea germinated among a few people to go pickpocketing among the revelers on New Years Eve, and then once word spread around horny males, the plan metastasized into something the original planners didn't envision.  What worries me more, however, is the possibility that the guys going along with this simply didn't think that sexual assault was a _big enough deal_ to attract this degree of attention, scrutiny and blowback, and that may suggest something very unsettling regarding the clash of cultures that Germany has invited upon itself.",168

"Schwarzer belongs to the old guard of feminism, which was actually interested in equality. She's being replaced by younger SJWs who are far more interested in screaming about 'cultural appropriation' and accusing Schwarzer of *being a racist*, than they are in combating misogyny.

&gt; Cologne's central train station isn't far from the tower where the office of one of Germany's leading feminists, Alice Schwarzer, is located. It is from there that she broadcasts her commentaries on current events out into the world. When it comes to the sexual assaults on New Year's Eve in Cologne, Schwarzer speaks of ""war"" and ""terror.""
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Schwarzer is speaking the language of all the people who see the events of New Year's Eve as proof that sexual violence is an imported problem -- a result of failed immigration. Young German feminists see it differently.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; They argue that sexual violence is not a migrant phenomenon at all, but a long-standing, societal problem. Young feminists like Anne Wizorek criticize that Schwarzer -- along with many others -- is using the New Year's violence to fuel racist sentiment. They also criticize that broad swathes of society are acting as though there wasn't any sexual violence in Germany before the refugees arrived.

"Fox News boards are full to the brim with the tried and true republican mental gymnastics that you'd expect. One of the top comments right now is about how the DA is a liberal who used her liberal power to get the jury to side with her and vote accordingly because liberals always abuse power and this is a perfect example. Many of the other comments are just calling the DA a ""libtard,"" ""lib baby murderer,"" ""gruber,"" etc forever. 

It's amazing to me how quickly the main demographic of Fox News can throw everything they know out the door to for a chance to pin it on ""them"" (meaning liberals) when their perception couldn't be further from the truth. Even more amazing is how many ""likes"" the comments with the most outlandish bullshit receive. It's a sad, yet fascinating, look into the human psyche. 

Some people, the absolute weakest people emotionally in my opinion, get so hellbent on their own personal beliefs that their tunnel vision limits what they observe to the point where actual-reality and their-reality aren't the same at all. Just look at the 2 people indicted... They forced their narrative that wasn't there in real life and thousands of other emotionally and mentally weak people flock to it in their pursuit of validating themselves. It's pathetic and sad but it also holds clout in politics since it works on some people. Glad to see the grand jury was not in that camp.

According to [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/11301897/Icesave-UK-government-recovers-1.36bn-of-money-used-to-bail-out-savers-in-Icelandic-bank.html) article at least. And we're paying the last 15% of the 25 million euros we owed the Netherlands [in the next few days](http://www.nltimes.nl/2016/01/13/iceland-repays-last-dutch-account-holders-in-icesave-collapse/).

Basically what we voted on was that the people of Iceland, who had nothing to do with what private banks were doing, shouldn't be the ones paying off the debts of that bank. Instead we've been making the bank itself pay off its debts.

*Edit: For clarification, by ""we"" in the first sentence I was talking about the Landsbanki bank.

*Edit 2: I just remembered that Landsbankinn actually paid off all of its debts just the other day. The first article I linked was from 2014. Landsbankinn has paid about 210 billion ISK, which is about 1.5 billion Euros. [Here's](http://www.vidskiptabladid.is/frettir/icesave-krafan-greidd/124048/) a source, it's in Icelandic but you can google translate it.",239

What if someone has pictures of their kid running around after they whipped their diaper off, does the IT person then decide if that's child porn? 

Not to mention there are many MANY other issues with this, it's super easy to frame someone. You can easily plant photos on someones drive even if you're locked out of their system via password. 

Not to mention there was an article I read awhile back about how child porn consumers hide their porn using ""honeypots"" where their stash is essentially sitting on someone else's system that they access via the internet and that someone else has absolutely no clue about it. 

Also there's the fact that despite what hollywood makes it seem like, most IT professionals aren't computer forensic experts and many computer forensics experts aren't computer forensics experts.

Despite what the title of this post may lead people to believe, the police didn't kill this man back in 2013. The article explains that the  Jaramillo's sister believed there was an intruder in her home with intent to kill her and her brother. Even after police arrived and nobody was in the home except Jaramillo and his sister, the sister was still very scared. Obviously she must have been shaken up because she believed someone was there trying to kill her but due to the house being a mess, Jaramillo being intoxicated, and uncooperative, one would assume the brother was the real threat. However, the sister told the police otherwise so instead of arresting him, they decided to separate the two in order to find out if he was abusing her or not. Instead of cooperating with police, even after they made it clear he wasn't being arrested, Jaramillo resisted and was then forced out of the house where he continued to resist. So yea, when you pin someone down, you do it with your own weight. Not really sure why the article or anyone else seems to be shocked by that.

(depending on state) You pull up to a stop light, and someone walks up to your window, breaks the glass and starts threatening you (just assume that you can't drive away). . . you reach over and grab the loaded gun from your glove box and shoot and kill the guy. 

I am no lawyer and laws vary by region, but in all likelihood you will not be charged with murder as it was self-defense, but they would probably charge you with illegally carrying a gun and confiscate your firearm, even if it did save your life.

I can't speak for anyone else, but [from my own experience] it is often the small business owners themselves that sent me into a megastore's hands.

Closed on Mondays, Closed on Sundays, ""Back in an hour"" in the middle of afternoon, shit quality inventory, staff that had no idea how their products worked, lazy, incredibly slow staff, ugly poorly lit decor, bad return policies - after a while you just get tired of dealing with mom-and-pop store bullshit, and instinctively pick Wal-Mart (or some other megastore). My family and their friends in small town all did the same. No one wants to abandon the local guys -- very often those store owners are their neighbors, the folks that sit next to you in church, etc. But they're stuck - Wal-Mart is just better - ""they have everything I need""

The city layout in some of these smaller cities is another problem; flower shop on one side of town, grocery store across town, pharmacy in yet another place, local electronic store in middle of town and an absolute joke -- now I definitely have to stop by Walmart (and while I'm there, might as well knock out my pharmacy and grocery shopping).

"&gt;I'm a strong supporter of immigration reform, and of the need to provide a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. I very strongly support the DREAM Act, and will continue to strongly support it.

&gt; ...

&gt;... I have a hard time understanding the notion that there's a severe need for more workers from abroad when wages for these jobs rose only 4.5 percent between 2000 and 2011. You see stagnant wages for high skilled workers, when these companies tell you that they desperately need high skilled workers. Why not raise wages to attract those workers?

&gt;The bottom line is that I feel, very much, that a lot of the initiative behind these guest workers programs, a very large expansion of guest worker programs — H2B visas would go up to as many as 195,000, H1B to as many as 205,000 a year — is coming from large corporations who want cheap labor from abroad.

People are getting up in arms about this being a silly law, Denmark being riddled with rapes (Despite the fact that our rape per capita numbers are astonishingly low compared to America), and this girl having a smudge on her permanent record - and I'm sorry for hijacking your top comment

This girl will never face any permanent repercussions. She will if she doesn't pay her fine, but that goes away as soon as the debt is cleared. Beyond that, it's barely a slap on the wrist, and if she's a student, which she is young enough to be, she can get the fine halved because of our government's system to nurture and assist students. Even then, the judgement has yet to be handed down upon her, the police investigation is not through and no suspect has been apprehended.

What's even more annoying to me is how you take TheLocal at face value. You wouldn't take The Daily Mail at face value and trust every headline you read, surely? I have taken a look at the 3 biggest news outlets in the country, and I literally couldn't find this story on the frontpage, because it is a non-story. She carried an illegal weapon and as such, she's fined. The legality of the self defense is never at question, and never will be. If she had clawed out his eyes in the process, she'd have gotten a trip to the hospital for free to dig some DNA out, probably some free hot chocolate (Only reason I can be dragged to a hospital), and she'd be on her way.

If this case had happened in America, and someone without a concealed carry permit had shot their offender, they'd be charged too, not for the action of self defense, but for the action of breaking the law put in place (General example in a non-CC state).

Our economy is the same way, it's a living thing.

You can't print money like newspapers and expect it to retain its value.  We were too chicken shit and too full of ourselves to change the behaviors that led to the collapse in 08.  Our tax laws incentivize outsourcing, and before we knew it we were consuming more than we produced.

Inflation will cause prices to continue to climb, and our collective debts will keep wages and salaries the same (with maybe a few bumps to the minimum wage for morale's sake) until we are collectively forced to work off what we've borrowed from other countries.

Expect the wage and price gap to slowly increase with the same veracity as a pot of water slowly starting to boil.

"&gt;  Now I hear from you it is in fucking Alaska. 

It's always been huge in alaska.

People have this view of really rural places as being totally free of vices they associate with cities.  Rural places like alaska where there's not much to do, it's depressingly dark for a long time, and kids are cooped up indoors in the dark with nothing to do are *very* fertile breeding grounds for addiction to opiates.

Add in an economy and lifestyle that involves a lot of physicality and you end up with a lot of physicians writing a lot of opiate scripts for pain, that can easily morph into something worse.

I'm up in maine and we've been experiencing the same thing for a while.  These drab, economically depressed small towns have jack shit to do for months, half the residents already have some work related excuse that could probably get them legal opiates, and suddenly you have an unexpected epidemic on your hands.

And then everyone starts using rhetoric that's acting like it's out of state urban cancer spreading into our pristine rural paradise, and treating it like it's a stereotypical drug problem of junkies in ghettos buying from gangs.

"Contrary to some of the replies you're getting, it's actually well researched though constantly debated. Fight club exaggerates the equation but effectively everything you do in life is a calculated risk. Regardless of how safe you try to make something, there's still a finite probability that there's a failure. You aim to design with fail-safes, redundancy, tolerance and factors of safety but there are situations where you simply have to make a trade-off that there's acceptable risk. A 'fun anecdote' is that there have been planes in the past that are actually design to take off under a factor of safety of 1 (100%), meaning that if they were to land with their take off weight, the plane would fail. Fuel is burnt through flight, lessening the weight. I don't know how specifically true that is but there are other cases where you simply can't increase factors of safety as the extra redundancy actually will reduce it. Going back to the plane, you could lessen the impact of a crash by reinforcing the airframe but adding that extra weight will cause it to impact the ground with more force/energy, which could reduce the factor of safety.

At some point, you just accept that it's 'safe enough'.

Is $.9/vehicle cost saving reasonable? Actually, if you sold perhaps a 100 million cars, then you're paying $90 million extra for a catastrophic failure rate of 0.000125%. This again is an exaggeration as I doubt it affected 100M cars but in any case, you have make a decision to dry the line somewhere.

"The reason the focus is on the governor is because Flint residents blame the governor for pretty much everything that happens in Flint. To understand why, let me walk you through a major issue in the last few years in Michigan politics...

The City of Flint has been in very dire financial straits for some time because of its stagnant economy, a situation mirrored in many other Michigan municipalities. To get these municipalities into better fiscal shape, Governor Rick Snyder pushed through legislation allowing the governor to appoint an emergency financial manager to completely takeover the operations of such a municipality. This EFM would have absolute authority to do anything he deemed necessary to get a city's finances in line, regardless of the views of the elected city government. Snyder viewed this as necessary because municipal politics, local corruption, or a combination thereof was preventing sound financial decisions from being made in many townships. Snyder's predecessor, Governor Jennifer Granholm, had also appointed EFMs, but under a much more limited set of laws that granted those EFMs more limited authority.

Voters absolutely hated these EFMs because once appointed, an EFM would inevitably gut the city government. The Pontiac Emergency Financial Manager famously eliminated the vast majority of city services including the city police and fire departments -- not reduced them in size, but literally disbanded them. Pontiac is an extreme example, but bottom line is that when an EFM shows up, the result is going to be a lot of job losses and service shutoffs. These losses/shutoffs often drove more residents out of these poverty-ridden cities, reducing revenue even further, and thus again creating a financial crisis. So many cities would get caught in this cycle of EFM appointments -- EFM shows up, makes cuts; revenue falls, creating financial emergency; EFM shows up, makes more cuts; repeat ad nausea. To address this, voters repealed the EFM law by referendum.

Governor Synder remained committed to the EFM program, though. He pushed a bill through the state legislature again authorizing the program, and this time he attached a small funding measure to the bill. By doing so, Snyder prevented the bill from being repealed by voters, given that the state constitution prohibits the repeal of bills that include appropriations. Snyder then used this newfound EFM power to appoint EFMs in several highly liberal, poverty-stricken cities -- Detroit, Pontiac, and Flint. These EFMs took almost complete control, and proceeded to make numerous highly unpopular decisions in order to get things in order. The EFM in Detroit famously declared bankruptcy. The EFM in Pontiac abolished the police/fire departments. And the EFM in Flint decided to stop paying Detroit for its pristine city water, instead getting water from the Flint River, and treating that water itself. Now, to be clear -- in Detroit and Flint, most city leaders actually supported these moves by the EFM. But most citizens did not, and city leaders happily told the public that they were only backing these moves because they needed to compromise with this EFM in order to have any influence. The EFM, on the other hand, would probably say that the city leaders long wanted to do this, but couldn't lest they lose re-election, and so he was providing them much-needed political cover to get a tough job done.

The Flint City government (in coordination with state officials) promptly FUBARed the provision of water. They used chemicals to treat the water that would corrode the lead pipes, something Detroit also does. But Detroit puts in additional chemicals to prevent lead pipe corrosion, countering this effect. Flint did not put in those additional chemicals. So the pipes started breaking down, causing lead to leak into the water supply. This is super noticeable now (literally yellow water), but initially, it wasn't at all noticeable. So lots of people drank it, and there's been a bunch of lead-related illnesses as a result. State officials that were supposed to be checking to ensure that the water was safe failed to realize these problems for a number of reasons (mostly incompetence so far as I can tell). And when they realized they'd made an error, there was a lot more effort made towards covering their own asses than there was towards solving the problem. Indeed, they falsified some data in reports to the federal Environmental Protection Agency to keep it from getting involved. But even once alarm bells were being setoff by regulators, many in the city and state government ignored them until things were REALLY bad.

So, all that said, we come back to Governor Snyder. Snyder appointed the EFM that made the ultimate decision to switch off the Detroit water network. Voters hate that this EFM is there, they hate that the EFM ignored their wishes and switched off Detroit city water, and they hate Snyder for taking advantage of a constitutional technicality to keep the EFM law even after they repealed it. Snyder appointed the state officials whose incompetence, and subsequent attempts at cover-up, prevented anyone from realizing the water was dangerous. The city residents, who already hate Snyder, take this as even more reason to hate him. And to make matters worse, Snyder reacted incredibly slowly to the disaster, only authorizing a comprehensive state-level response in the last couple weeks. The city residents take this as even MORE evidence that Snyder is a horrible governor.

So when the national media shows up to ask locals ""what's going on,"" the locals all immediately start saying ""Rick Snyder is an incompetent dictator whose poisoning our children so he can give tax cuts to the rich!"" The Democratic Party, seeing a political opportunity, immediately jumps in to say ""yep, exactly what they said, this tyrant is essentially injecting children with lead himself!"" The Republican Party, not really wanting to highlight how one of their star governors failed to quickly respond to a disaster, isn't talking about it. And so the media, in their coverage, mostly talks about the governor (something they're prone to do anyway since he's the most well-known Michigander).

And that's why everyone is talking about the governor -- either because they hate him or because they're interviewing people that hate him.

EDIT: Wow! Thank you for the gold! 

EDIT2: It's been pointed out to me that there are a couple minor factual omissions here, for which I do apologize (I wrote this up in about 20 minutes without doing much rechecking of facts). First, Flint was planning to ultimately switch to Port Huron water, and was only using the river water for a couple years until a pipeline could be constructed over to Port Huron (a city over in the thumb). Second, in addition to certain treatment chemicals being corrosive to lead pipes, river water itself is naturally more corrosive to lead pipes (compared to the lake water that Detroit uses).

EDIT3: Oh, and, to be clear -- there are still police and fire services in Pontiac, Michigan. The Oakland County Sheriff's Department provides police services (more effectively in the eyes of many in the area) while a neighboring fire department provides fire services.",1829

I don't envy those that have to try to find a balance between costs, design safety, and market demand, but calling them all sociopaths is an ignorant assessment of the complexity of the question. ",197
"And now we have the truth. Illegal hunting. And they knew the fire would go out of control like the first time. It was destruction of evidence, and they burned hundreds of acres to protect their own feed, which costs nearly nothing and is insured by federal disaster programs. Completely unreasonable to burn hundreds of acres over such a trivial and easily replaced resource. 

I've actually spent a lot of time traveling and deliverying equipment to farms all over the country, and they litterally have so much feed that it sits in the fields rotting. They'll have new feed surrounded by piles of old rotting feed in the same pasture. 

We would usually take loads of it back when we dropped off equipment so that we didn't have to go back to the factories empty. Just huge fields full of feed and rotting feed. They had so much and it was so cheap they would put it in shipping containers and send it to China. There are even fields full of feed where it's marked all in Chinese. I mean enough feed to fill a Walmart to the ceiling. It's just everywhere and it costs nearly nothing.

And as I've already mentioned, as farmers they are insured by the federal government against loss.

"Just to be clear, the situation you're describing is exactly what the people this article are talking about were illegally denied:

&gt;The law forgives debt for borrowers who prove their schools used illegal tactics to recruit them, such as by lying about their graduates’ earnings.

Your point, broadly speaking, is that you are or were making informed decisions.  You chose to take out a level of debt that, presumably, was balanced with your expectations of future earnings, your understanding of the usefulness of the skills you were being taught, the likelihood you will get a job, etc ...

The students in this article _attempted_ to make the same decisions, but were given fraudulent information, so when they made a decision they _thought_ was the right one, it was not.  And it was not the right decision not because they made a simple mistake, but because the numbers they relied upon -- provided by their colleges -- were falsified.  

Imagine if you were getting a graphics design degree.  You ""know"" your college's placement rates and you know the median salary for that position in your geographic area so you make a decision that 60k in loans is an acceptable number.  Hell, you might even be proactive enough to plan out a draft repayment schedule, and then you find out 3 years in that the program they've been teaching you, the program they told you was the industry standard, was not.  In fact, you've been learning Microsoft Paint and you had no doubts because you trusted the exact people whose jobs are supposed to be to teach you about the industry and its expectations.  Now your decision, which was well-reasoned, is a stupid one.  You won't get hired, you won't see the increase in salary a college degree was supposed to provide, and you owe $60k for the privilege of being lied to.  

I see no problem with asserting that in such situations you are owed redress.  Given the money issues these people are having, a plan where the government forgives the loans you owe to it and then uses its clout to ""claw back"" money from the offending institutions seems very fair to me.",360

The officer, not knowing the guy he pulled over was an expert in lasers, cut him off in the middle of his explanation and said ""Sir, you're wrong.  This is one uses a laser and has more accuracy than anything we use, therefore, you were speeding and just accept the ticket""

So just as we thought we were going to resume class my professor said ""He screwed with the wrong guy and the reason I'm late was I was making measurements of the scene because we're going to prove that bastard wrong"". 

In the two months before going to court he built an entire case completely full of calculations, atmospheric conditions, and even obtained some basic info on the radar gun used. He ran many experiments with his laser lab class and went on to prove that in the conditions of that day and the angle at which my professor was in relation to the officer the accuracy of the gun was reduced to about 20%-30% and was even able to show that a person walking could be shown going 60mph.  

So with all this he goes to court, the officer was there, and the judge asks him how he'd like to plea and my professor asked if he could present his findings.   He gave a 20 minute rundown of the problem, physics behind it, and calculations, and his final results.  

When he was done the judge simply said ""I don't know half the words you just said to me, but given you're a subject mater expert in lasers and know much more than anyone in this room on it, I'm going to assume you're right and dismiss the ticket.  He then suggested the officer  have his radar gun looked at and to not use it in fog because he didn't want to be lectured like that again and be made to look stupid""

**TL;DR** Cop pulls my physics professor, who's an expert in lasers, claims my professor was lying and that his ""radar"" gun was based on a laser so it's too accurate to be wrong. Professor spends 2 months proving the laser was ineffective, gave the judge a laser lecture and got the ticket dismissed. 

**Edit 2:**  This was not  Dmitri Krioukov from University of California.   It was a professor of physics in Francis Marion University.  This also occurred around 1998-99 in a small podunk town in S. Carolina called Florence.  

For those asking why he spent 2 months ""just"" to prove the LIDAR was inaccurate and building a case, he also used this case of his to teach 2 labs (laser and optics) and another class (which was mine).   

Edit 3:  A note...yes I used radar and laser ""gun"" interchangeably.  The gun was a LiDAR, but in the South (especially around the 90s) they used the terms interchangeably.  Hell they still do. ",5056

"Alright everyone, before you get your face all knotted up, read the article. While it should be taken with a grain of salt, here's the companies statement-

&gt;“On January 14, 2016, M/V Tatoosh was moored in a position explicitly directed by the local Port Authority. When its crew was alerted by a diver that her anchor chain may have impacted coral in the area, the crew promptly, and on their own accord, relocated their position to ensure the reef was protected. Vulcan and the ship’s crew are actively and cooperatively working with local authorities to determine the details of what happened. An investigation by local authorities is ongoing.”

If that's at all true (and it would be a pretty ballsy thing to completely fabricate this, since as far as I know people generally keep records of this sort of thing) then really it's the Port Authority who's at fault for asking them anchor in the wrong place.

Also, while coral reefs are an amazing and vital portion of our seas, and it's sad to see any portion destroyed, **this is 3/10ths of an acre. In contrast, the great barrier reef is (according to google) 85,103,360 acres and is being destroyed on a massive scale every year** by rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and pollution.

"Oh, not even close.

First, you have people jumping into college that either shouldn't be going yet, or should never go at all.  College is supposed to be for the advancement of education, not a societal expectation.

Second problem is that jobs that used to require either less than or equal to a high school education now require college educations without warrant.  The simple response would be, ""Well, why not?""  Given the assumption that a more educated individual is even more qualified for the managerial positions, even though this is proven to be very false.

Associated with the first point, but with a somewhat different perspective, college is being attended for pointless education.  Woman's studies, black history, and other courses are drawing in students who aren't actually taking meaningful courses that can be applied in the real world, especially with the quantity of individuals that are attending.  It's like a football player thinking he can get into the NFL.

Edit: many of you are bringing up this ""vote with your wallet"" argument. To address this we need a clear picture of what usually happened. Walmart first had to be able to get a commercial business license from the town or county (many towns didn't want walmart because voters didnt like the prospect of all of their friends going out of business) which in *many* cases came about as campaign contributions that made local donations look like chump change. Step one was buying out the local government. Step two was muscling people out of shopping at mom and pop businesses by pricing everything so low (low enough that walmart lost money) that people couldn't believe the prices. Which they shouldnt have because step 3 was waiting for the other locally owned businesses to tank followed by step four which was bringing the prices back up enough to make money again but not so much anyone would consider competing.

Put yourself in the shoes of the local business owners (literally priced out of competition because they dont have billions in assets to use putting everyone else out of business) and consumers (prices so low that you begin to wonder if the neighbor was gouging you for that pet food or that car part and dont really care what happens to the neighbor because of it).

"TL;DR content creators do not want people to see their content legally and have given Netflix an ultimatum and/or Netflix is just covering it's ass (which is more likely) and bringing more attention to the ridiculousness of region restrictions on the internet

very easy to accomplish too, you are restricted to the country of your billing address (ways around that too, but Netflix would still be covering their ass)

edit: that is assuming their intentions are to restrict to bill address, this could still be ""not give a shit about consumers lives and where they live/travel"" restrictions from the studios ",407

"The short version?

They want to maintain control over their property. Netflix pays the content owner a fee for each region that's set by the owner. Basically, content owners have Netflix by the balls, they have for years. This is why there's such a big push within Netflix to generate their own content. That way they have control over said content, and aren't bent over a barrel all the time.",393

"[Mummers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummers_Parade) are groups of people who spend all year making elaborate, massive costumes and sets do they can parade them down the street on New Years day. It's, as far as I know, a specific Philadelphia tradition (I've attended quite a few, it is a real spectacle, everyone in the city watches--if you're from here, you know it). 

The ""Fancy"" type, and some other types share a likeness to the Mardi Gras New Orleans Indian marches in terms of costumes being huge plumage feathered displays. I have no idea if they are directly related in anyway though. But the core goal is to be the prettiest costume (Along with synchronized dance routines to show them off). Some of these costumes can weigh enormous amounts (A few hundred pounds) and these guys march for HOURS in them, the whole parade is judged as an art form but it is also really a test of endurance too, since you're judged at the end of the parade (When you do your big routine, which is broadcast on TV--but this is only after hours of marching and several routines done throughout the parade route). 

The irony behind this protest is that the Mummers are a melting pot parade, which in part is meant to celebrate the diversity of the city. It's derived from almost a dozen European ethnic groups (Which at the time were highly factional and there was some hostility between them) and African Americans coming together to celebrate the holidays and show off their traditions, all mixed up and competing to make the ""prettiest"" outfit (Which is why I said it has something in common with the Indians in Mardi Gras). It is a symbol of diversity, and more importantly, peaceful cultural exchange (And eventually, as it is now, showing how cultures blend together over time to create something new--what was once many cultures that disliked each other, are now one culture, a uniquely new world culture. It's pretty neat). 

Like many things though, I suppose it has been misunderstood by a group of people that choose to be enraged by the superficial, rather than understanding the substance of something. ",148
