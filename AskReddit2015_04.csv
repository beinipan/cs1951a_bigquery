my depression was anger and anxiety and obsession/compulsion and unmotivated rather than sadness/lack of any emotion/numb. so, it can take many forms.

medication side effects wear off for me relatively well. and they aren't that bad to begin with, either. and medications work instantly for me. i can feel the difference right away. i have only tried a couple. but there are many out there that help for many things &amp; work in many different ways. see here: http://www.crazymeds.us straight up 100% no bullshit.

"It was my twenty-first birthday. July 2013. Heatwave.

I had thrush and oh.my.god it hurt like hell. I could barely even walk. Strike one. But it was my birthday and I was having a three-legged pub crawl in celebration of it that night. I read some things online that were supposed to help soothe it, like spooning natural yog in your vag. I had none of that, so I settled on the vinegar bath instead. 

My Dad was downstairs in the kitchen preparing my birthday meal - hot dogs. I don't even like hot dogs, they are my least favourite food. That was strike two. 

So I'm soaking in my stinky bath, trying to soothe my flaming hot, swollen and itchy labia, when I look down and notice a shit load of new stretch marks on my stomach. I'm not a big girl, but for some reason, my skin fucking hates me and I have a fair few stretch marks. I start crying. I could tolerate the ones on my arse, my inner thigh, even the ones on my boobs. But this? This was too much. Strike three.

I dressed myself and sulked downstairs. I told my Dad I didn't want the hot dogs anymore because I was too fat. 

I slump back up stairs and dramatically fling myself on my bed. The curtains were closed, and I sobbed heavily into my pillow. My Dad came upstairs and comforted me, telling me that everyone has stretch marks blah blah blah and that I should just get ready for my birthday and I see how I feel. He even offered to buy me a bottle of Pimms. 

I decided he was right, so he left the room and I opened the curtains. I removed the dress I was wearing and looked down at my stomach to assess the situation, but miraculously, the stretch marks had disappeared. 

This is the story of how I cried for almost two hours over new stretch marks, only to discover that they were just the indents from my tight pyjama bottoms. ",4

Hello Raye!,1
"Ive raised our twin daughters alone since she left 16 years ago. She has mental health issues and left fearing she would harm them as they became the focus of many of her issues.  
The girls graduate in just a few weeks....  
My ex and I have never stopped loving each other. 100% of our issues, up until she remarried, were related to her relationship to our daughters. She and I have personally reconnected time and again over the years...when I try to get our daughters in the mix...she freaks out and runs. The last time she disappeared for 18 months and was married when she reconnected with me. 
That was when I cut things off physically with her, she cant understand nor accept that. She believes that since she kept my last name, and told her current husband that I will always be her true love and if he cant handle that she couldnt marry him that everything should be fine.   
She neglected to get my opinion, but feels I have no right to be opposed since its HER and HIS marriage thats open....its between them....I dont know whats off with her meds...but theres no way Id be okay with that. So for 7 years, Ive refused to see her, refused to be with her, and everytime she tries i tell her ""Divorce him"". 

See the problem is..  
she has built a life where she is....she has friends...a job....and a husband who she can walk all over and do whatever she wants and he wont say a thing. Doormat.   
With me she has fear and uncertainty....she worries that I wont really love her if she returns, that somehow I am mistakenly holding onto her. She worries that she couldnt handle it, even with our daughters about to graduate...she returns...she will have to deal with them...and her guilt. At some level, she admits, she also is afraid to lose ""her power"" because for the first time in her life she feels like a grown up and in charge.....and with me...no matter how much she fights it...shes a child....she has always held me in a very paternal role. Even now...Im the one advising her on how to consolidate her husbands student loans into a program eligible for PSLF.   

So to answer you...if she ever actually leaves him...yes. I am the only man she has ever loved...but love isnt always enough.",1

&gt; To the gentleman who left his scarf on the dirty tiles of the 7th floor men’s washroom:

&gt; Was it this sudden blast of warm spring weather that prompted you to so tactlessly discard your black-knit wool/acrylic-blend Club Monaco scarf, or was it simply an accident? I’ve asked the scarf, but as is typical with most clothing items, my query was met with silence. 

&gt; I’ve looked at the long-term forecast, and sadly it seems that you might very well be in need of said scarf in the weeks to come (although I might suggest hand washing it in cold water and laying flat to dry—as per the cleaning instructions—before its next outing, as it was found in a not-so-nice location).

&gt; So if this errant scarf does belong to you, please stop by Office Services to retrieve it, so we can help protect your neck.

"You should reflect on how they're toxic in your life. Everyone is imperfect, and in relationships there will be periods in life when things can be extremely difficult to communicate or understand where someone is coming from and can say things that are hurtful. But there is a line and you should be able to identify when it's truly abusive.

If they are great half the time and toxic the other half, they are still 100% toxic. This sort of dynamic is how people stay in abusive friendships or relationships with other people. No one stays when it's bad all the time. It's the ""you just don't understand him/her"" excuse. To be toxic half the time is not ok. 

This is why it's hard for people to understand abuse and how others or even themselves can fall in to it. Because really, it's easy to justify things for people you love, and you will understand the how and why better than the people on the outside looking in. But that doesn't change the fact that it is a situation is a bad one.

And just to throw in my two cents, I've found in my life people who will identify others as toxic to completely remove the blame from themselves. Sometimes the case is as simple as looking inward and taking an interest in other peoples boundaries. ",7

&gt; Bates' techniques have not been objectively shown to improve eyesight.[3] His main physiological proposition—that the eyeball changes shape to maintain focus—has consistently been contradicted by observation.[4] In 1952, optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates, ""Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists.""

"Without any prep?  I dunno.

But you can cook literally for dinner last night, and have it for leftovers at lunch today.

If you're a bachelor like me, only cooking for yourself, my go-to almost-zero-effort-low-cost-high-nutrition food is a single-pot dish with kale, rice, and chicken.  It goes...a little somethin'...a-like-a-this-ah:  
1) Buy a box of long-grain+wild rice, a big bag of kale, and a rotisserie chicken.  
2) Cook the wild rice in the bottom of the biggest pot you have.  
3) When the rice is about five minutes from being done, i.e., it's mostly solid but still plenty of moisture remaining, just dump the kale on top of it.  The kale gets steamed on top of the rice.  
4) After five minutes, both the kale and the rice should be done.  While it was cooking, you were chopping up the already-cooked, already-delicious chicken.  Give it five minutes for the rice to sit, then toss in the chopped up chicken and mix the whole thing together.  Done.  Bip.  Easy.  You can add whatever flavors you want; I generally just let it go as is and add some sriracha or bbq sauce when I eat it.  You can eat right away, or you can let it all cool and dump it into lots of single-serving tupperwares, for lunch, dinner, whenever.

The whole process takes a half hour, if that.  It costs *maybe* ten bucks, and if you're the only one eating it, your cooking needs are met for three, four days, easily.  It's also tasty and extremely healthy.",1

It will leak out eventually if you do. I won't even tell my pet dog, Waffles. He's a shifty eyed bastard.

3 . Can't make any weird money movements either. 

I don't want people to suspect that I'm talking my money and running. So no emptying my bank account out. 

4 . Exhibit suicide like behavior

First, you have to do a suicide. If the cops think it's murder, then they will investigate. That only leaves suicide. But you can't just go and kill yourself. First you gotta act suicidal. Do drugs and drink. Lose interest in things you loved. Act depressed. 

5 . Write the note

Make sure I am more concerned about my family than myself. Talk about how my stuff will be split up. Use the word love a lot.

6 . Suicide

Jumping off a bridge is the best way. Hard to find the body. Leave the note where they can find it. Maybe one at house, and one at bridge. Make sure they know you jumped off bridge.

7 . GTFO

Get out of there. I'll probably leave the country so I don't have to deal with faked IDs. Purchase an passport off the black market. Also, it might be a good idea to, if I haven't already, dispose of electronic devices. Tossing it off the bridge sounds nice.

8 . Change my appearance

Now that I'm in Zimbabwe, or somewhere, I need to change my appearance.  I'm thinking blond. Long hair. Scar on my face maybe. Definitely a full beard. And change my name. 

9 . Off the grid

I'm not really going to get into this, because I already faked my death, this is just so people don't find you again. Plus you get the gist, use cash, don't write name on things, keep off cameras, etc..

10 . CELEBRATE!

Congrats Sheachlann Slaanesh! (my new name) I'm dead! Now no-one will link me to my vaguely inappropriate Reddit username. Was it all worth it? I don't know, but it's too late now! Cheers!

"I am simply a collector of fine masturbation related literature. Here have another!

WTF i get caught jacking off all the time

i'm not unlucky, its just standard probability. i beat off alot. seriously, i beat off like if i keep doing it, i'm gonna win something. its only natural people will stumble in eventually

FOR EXAMPLE

so i'm on this direct flight from claremont (my college town) back to kansas city (my home town) for winter break. since its a direct 3 hour flight, its too short for them to have ""in flight entertainment,"" but its so long that i'm gonna be bored out of my god damn mind. so, of course, i'm like ""i guess i'm beating off like 5 times during this flight.""

its one of those small sized slingshot airplanes that goes really fast but is really unstable and has one tiny ass cramped aisle. so i'm sitting in my anorexic bucket seat w/ my shitty peanuts waiting for the plane to hit a high enough altitude when i finally hear: ding ""this is your captain speaking, we have reached a cruising altitude of 30,000 feet, you are now free to move about the cabin."" ""bink success!"" i think to myself, ""the time is right."" of course i don't rush to the bathroom, no need for that. why not give myself a little tease. i gently, slowly unbuckle my seatbelt. I stand up, and stretch a little bit. I take a nice slow, leisurely walk to the bathroom at the back of the plane. masturbation this good deserves foreplay of its own.

i get to the bathroom, close the door, and sliiiiiide my pants on down and start working myself. oh holy LORD it's amazing. i mean, i don't know if you know this or not, but i am REALLY good at masturbating. I'm in a 2 square foot, dimly lit bathroom, but i feel so good my back is arching and my foot is cramping and i'm nearly ready to start screaming my own name.

then suddenly, TURBULENCE. AGH SHIT. I HATE turbulence. It's not that it makes me feel sick or nauseated. turbulence makes me feel like i'm about to die. So i'm trying to jack off, and suddenly the jerk in the plane floods my body w/ adrenaline and i grab the handle in the bathroom and i'm like ""OH SHIT.""

do you know how hard it is to cum when you feel like you're about to die??? I mean seriously, imagine jacking off while there's a guy w/ a loaded gun to your head and he's screaming ""C'MON CUM YOU PUSSY, DO IT CUM."" You'd be shivering w/ eyes closed, tears streaming down your face as you sputter through little snot bubbles just BEGGING your dick to come. ""please cum!!!"" you'd weep ""i wanna cum soooo bad!!!!!""

so there i am trying to think of every dirty thing possible so i can finally orgasm, but all that's going through my mind is ""god i need to reconcile with my dad and tell my brother i love him"" etc etc and while i'm distracted in a mess of standard pre-death thoughts, i don't realize that i'm about to cum.

HOLY FUCK i say as i fumble and try to grab some kleenex from the box on the counter. however, in my stuttered panic, i just knock the kleenex box over, hit the ""stewardess help button,"" and i cum directly onto the floor. still in a state of panic i'm like FUCKFUCKFUCK I NEED TO TURN THIS BUTTON OFF so of course i (geniusly) press it like 5 more times trying to turn this off. Naturally, the button just goes ding ding ding ding, making my situation seem all the more urgent, and i can hear the stewardess rushing to the door since i appear to be in desperate need of help.

""FOCUS SEAN FOCUS,"" i think, ""I NEED TO HIDE MY DICK."" so, (this is genius) i pick up the kleenex box from the floor, pull out 5 pieces of tissue, and i just lay them on top of my erection... so it looks kinda like a little dick tent. so, the stewardess, responding to my urgent spams of the ""stewardess help button"" proceeds to open the bathroom door just like i knew she was going to. She looks on the ground to see my epic protein stain, looks up at my glorious dicktent, and then you know what happens?? we make eye contact.

so she's looking at me, and i'm looking at her and in general i dislike awkward silences. however, this was an all KINDS of awkward silence, so i figured it was necessary to say something. so, i did the best i could. i look her right in the eye and say ""... it is what it is...""

???? why did i say that???? what a stupid thing to say... well... i guess it's hard in that situation to ""play it off cool."" i can't be like ""hey i know smoking isn't allowed on the plane, so do you have a stick of gum??""

so she shuts the door, and i clean myself up and spend another 3 minutes trying to clean up the mass of cum on the floor. even though i did a pretty good job, its damn hard to get that shine out of the laminate flooring. i'm finally done, so i open up the bathroom door to see a line of 10 or so people that's been building up since i went into the bathroom like 20 minutes ago (again, it took my a while since its difficult to cum when you think you're about to die). I get to look across the line of all of em, and say the only sensible thing i can think of:

""for those of you going to use the bathroom, i'd make sure you're wearing shoes.""",5

I never finished training because what ultimatly happened was they hired a new girl (and mind you every single CSR was a woman except one guy) and right off the bat made her a CSR. They weren't looking for one, I asked for the training and they happily obliged. Here I had been training for 3 months and being told I was doing a good job, but here comes dumb blonde D (thats what we are saying her name is) who just started and with 0 training gave her her numbers.

That proved the disrespect that I had felt in that whole place. My boss was a bitch, the manager of the store was an asshole, and the only saving grace was my father worked in another department, only half as miserable as I was because frankly... his boss was awesome.",1

He tells me; im a drug dealer you mofo, you're not going to be behind this glass all the time. I tell him, let's do this right now ( I don't want to be looking over my shoulder all the time)

I know, I've been there but I managed to snap out of it before it got severe. What helped me was just making a plan, and making a daily journal as to what I did that day and how it helped me move towards nt goal. Thinking more about where I wanted to be helped me stop wallowing in self pity and got my ass in gear. I understand that everyone's situation is different and that what worked for me won't work for you, but just give it a shot. I mean. What have you got to lose? Just remember you're allowed to do nothing sometimes, to give yourself a break. Whevener you achieve something or a small goal, give yourself a pat on the back and treat yourself to something...

"I do have to agree that anti-gay bigotry in the US has been prevalent due to Christianity but it's based on fear or anger of difference, not religion itself.

And strictly speaking from the perspective of a Christian female from California with a multitude of friend/colleagues from the LGBT community -- I've been taught the focus is on acceptance of an individual because none of us are perfect and we are not to judge.

And the only difference is whether or not you believe there is or can be perfection/salvation of human nature through a greater entity -- that is why I believe in Jesus. 

He, my Father, and the Holy Spirit are the only reasons why I identify as a Christian -- not because I agree with ALL aspects (positive and negative) of Christianity but I do agree with a majority of it. Whether or not I've yet to agree is a journey for myself and myself only. (Always researching/looking at things for myself)

On a more human level, my opinion is the main focus should just be acceptance and this should be regardless of sexual preference, sexual orientation, and/or sexual acts (that are LEGAL anyway). Similar to BitCoinPatriot, it is not truthful or helpful (or even commanded) for any person to judge as God is the entity to judge. 

However, unlike BitCoinPatriot, I do not personally believe it is a ""sin"" to be LGBT or part of the community or even to support. If anything, love and acceptance may bring that individual closer to understanding the Gospel and based on my sect, that is the means and ways of bringing someone closer to God. If they choose the path away from God, that's their own decision and it's not up to us to control or condemn them.

All other decisions, choices, thoughts, can be advised by pastors, priests, etc. but it should only be done out of our own free will to understand and not due to pressures of ""anti-gay bigotry.""

As far as ""umbrellas"" go, that just seems to be seriously generalizing or simplifying for something you don't understand out of fear/anger.",1

"Not all tobacco is created equal. Cigarettes are a completely different thing than pipes and cigars. As a pipe smoker, I smoke in moderation and do not inhale. Sometimes during the winter I'll smoke a bowl a day but I don't feel any withdrawals after not having a pipe for days or weeks at a time. it's not an addiction, it's a hobby where I have control of when I want to smoke. Even with high nicotine blends it's not addicting. 

A lot of people just tend to group all tobacco together and don't take into consideration the differences between all the types and what actually makes its way into the finished product. A high quality pipe tobacco is just going to have tobacco in it with no additives. Maybe a light casing of rum or something. Cigarettes are LOADED with all kinds of nasty stuff to keep you addicted. 

Now OP, you mentioned moderation. I completely agree with this. It is most definitely possible to smoke tobacco in moderation (especially when smokes can be $30+ a stick!). I just think it's much harder to use moderation with cigarettes, for most people, because of the cravings. 

Anyways, just thinking out loud here.

That is just total naivety. 'I'm going to totally sever my income because I trust that this guy/girl will support me forever.' I can understand the mindset but rather than rewarding it, it should be discouraged.

Alimony, in this type of case, rewards partners who were short-sighted enough to abandon career pursuits or those partners who just aren't as skilled as their their SO. Your mother is exactly the type of woman we should be encouraging others to emulate.

&gt; It's also that for a lot of people to be successful, you sometimes need somebody who helps you take care of your domestic shit. 

Like a housekeeper? In the case of a stay at home wife, they essentially live like housekeepers who are paid by their husband providing money for groceries, phones and other comforts.

In a completely cold sense, alimony is like paying the housekeeper once they stop working for you.

&gt;  if you don't want to have to pay alimony, then either don't get married and/or have a long-term, serious relationship.

Why should a relationship/marriage pose such a huge risk for alimony in the first place, though? 

&gt; Alternatively, son't let your partner stay at home. Find somebody who is on a career path and doesn't want to get off of it.

Weet bix, or I think they're called vita brits in the states, are great if you crush them up with your hand a bit first. During cold times add a bit of hot water for pure healthy energy food.

Personally though I prefer simple porridge , or oatmeal, but the trick is to make it properly. First of all rolled oats are a must. Instant oats are a disgrace. Also, the bigger the rolled oats the better. Put water in and fill halfway up the water with oats. E.g if the water goes 10cm up the pot, put 5cm of oats in.Stir often so it doesn't stick. Keep heat high and reduce once it starts bubbling and is thick, almost gelatinous. Add desired amount of sugar. Brown sugar is better but white will also do. Scoop into bowls and add about a tablespoon of butter an d mix - butter will give you the most amazing oatmeal you will ever eat. For added sweetness,  swirl some honey on top.
