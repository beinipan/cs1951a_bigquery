The ones I was more concerned with were historical reasons. The example you've given is absolutely a valid reason for pay differences. To contrast, in Japan male pornstars can earn millions because of the shortage of newcomers.

This actually made me ponder a more general ethical question: let's say that we become able to cure any kind of fatal disease and have a magical pill that stops aging.  What would we do with people with life sentences?  Would it be ethical to prevent them from taking a pill like that (supposing they *did* want it)?  If we allowed them to take it, wouldn't it be cruel to have people locked up for hundreds of years?  Would we institute some sort of elective suicide or mandatory execution system for people incarcerated for some set period of time?  Or, would we just eventually let people out, doing away with life sentences altogether?  I know that this is pretty out there, but it's a consequence of curing aging that I'd never considered.  Even if we were able to prolong the average human life to some finite but still very long amount of time (hundreds of years), I think there'd be new ethical considerations.",34

"If your life is truly at stake, giving a few hundred or thousand dollars to save your life and start anew in a safer and opportunity rich country is well worth the price.

Since you're not a refugee from the Middle East and I was, let me shed some light on the situation. I've lived what these supposed refugees are going through and we had to sell a lot of our possessions to be able to escape in the first place. We were asset rich but were forced to leave our life behind, our house, practically all of our possessions. We also didn't get any help besides food in Spain where we first landed and had to sell all of the remaining things we had to survive. This is all after we risked our lives multiple times trying to escape and reach Europe in the first place.

That's why I don't buy this bullshit. The majority of these people seem like economic migrants, that's why they're so unappreciative of the help they're getting. They publicly complain about the food, the housing, etc. When my family was getting food at the food bank we weren't used to eating the things they gave us. Canned sardines, canned octopus, a lot of sea food. You know what though? We were just happy we weren't hungry.

I'm very sympathetic towards the plight of a refugee. It isn't easy. At the same time though accepting refugees is a charitable act. It's 100% optional and you're only getting this help because of kindness of your host country. Unless they're beating you, violating human rights, you have no fucking room to complain.

"&gt; You are incorrect. Science universally agrees there is no biological underpinning for race: You cannot look at someone's genes and tell what race they are. Ask any biologist or doctor. You can only determine race sociologically. Race is purely a social construct.

If you saw that someone had tay sachs disease or sickle cell anemia you'd know exactly what genetic strain they came from. I agree with you that race is not based on genetics but rather on outward appearance, a piss-poor method of classification. Still, there are heritable physiological expressions of genetics and there are genetic differences between groups of people, even if they don't correlate to popular conceptions of race they correlate to something. To say these differences don't exist is like saying that there is no difference between a mastiff and a chihuahua.

The important thing here is that legally everyone is the same regardless of these differences, not putting on blinders and pretending they don't exist. Not passing laws that prevent acknowledging differences. Not passing laws to censor opinions. 

&gt; That's an improvement. It's better when the racists aren't allow to openly advertise. No one can doubt that the social change that made it unacceptable to be publicly racist from the civil rights movement has done a lot to cow racists and improve the lives of people that previously had to deal with that shit out in the open every day. Forcing hate groups to do their recruiting in secret and be limited in their number for risk of fines or punishment would be fucking great.

It's hard to change public opinion when it's illegal to share/discuss it. One cannot publicly dismantle/ridicule bad ideas if not allowed to hear them. While we still have a ways to go, we've made a lot of progress in the US in regards to equality here without revoking the first amendment.

&gt;  I don't understand how your friends can feel like they are 'losing german culture' when the influx of refugees accounts for such a small percentage of the population. Rejecting the refugees is just what ISIS wants, it hopes to radicalize them and convince muslims everywhere they have no home except under their tyranny.

I agree, but that was their perception and I'm glad they were able to discuss it. It honestly reminded me a lot of people from the south who think everyone should speak English.

"I think it's important to understand something about Syrians and Muslims in general.

Many of them are very strict and conservative about sex. The women don't sexualize themselves the way they do in the West. The males don't look at porn all day like they do in the West. 

Sexually, they are ALL repressed (not just the women). So I can understand the culture shock of going from a place where everyone behaves a certain way and people respect each other and suddenly being thrust into a permissive culture where women wear next to nothing and men are just supposed to ignore it the best they can. 

That said, there are millions of refugees and only a handful of assaults. Are the numbers of sexual assaults any higher than in the rest of society?

The feminists will tell us that 1 in 5 women will be raped in college. So, if Germany has 100,000 women in college then we can expect 4,000 of them to be raped this year. 

Are crimes of these immigrants greater or more frequent than the alleged crimes of college students?

"Exactly. He says that ethnic cleansing (and murder/genocide) can be acceptable. I agree. How could the USA have been created otherwise? Or Australia? Or Canada? Humans would not have been able to evolve as a species if they were not able to supersede the weak and the vulnerable.

The Jews wanted their own state, and just a very small one at that. Why not? Everyone else was colonising the world, and no one cared that that required ethnic cleansing and murder — so why could the Jews not do it as well?

Indeed, the Zionists set-up the ""Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association"" in 1924:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Jewish_Colonization_Association

Six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, and that was just the culmination of thousands of years of anti-semitism, mainly cultivated by the Catholic Church. So the Jews saw the creation of their own state as a way to safeguard their future. Fair enough.

But the Jews, Zionists and their supporters need to stop believing their own propaganda that it *wasn't* ethnic cleansing; as believing your own propaganda is the beginning of the end for all peoples and states.

And ever wonder if trying to carve-out a ""homeland"" in the middle of the desert surrounding by people that will totally hate you to death for doing so was a good idea? Everyone, especially the British, warned the Zionists that they were crazy, and that the Muslims are nuts and would fight forever. Did they listen?

Do you really expect the Muslims to just keel-over? Do you expect the rest of the world to believe the Zionist propaganda?

Responsibility is *always* tied to agency. If I am killed by a rock slide, no one will ever blame the rocks. However, if someone *caused* the rock slide, that person may well be to blame for my death.

The reason why people say that victims are never responsible for being attacked is that their attackers have agency of their own and are expected to behave morally and to make the choice to not rape. Your analogy about cliffs and whatnot is therefore *completely fucking irrelevant*.

Let's try to illustrate this. Let's say I'm holding a knife and that same guy from before is walking obliviously toward me while checking his phone. I can lower the knife. I choose not to, because I'm reassured by your reasoning that it will be his fault, due to inattentiveness, when he impales himself on it.

Do you see how this is different from the guy walking off a cliff?

What you are talking about is not responsibility, it's prudence. It is *prudent* to try to predict and account for the behavior of others and to incorporate that into your risk mitigation strategy. It's advisable for you to do so, but you do not have a responsibility to do so. Others have a responsibility to behave morally so that it is unnecessary for you to take precautions in the event that they don't.

So just imagine, as an enterprising (and horny) young teenager, playing with the URLs to figure out what the directory structure was and how they were named. 

At that point, let's say you go to the console (because all the cool kids in 1999 were running Linux, or so I'm told) and type something like

Furthermore, the board was stripped of some of their power. They now need the minister approval for ""all key decisions"" and cannot ""make decisions that go beyond what a normal (eg. commercial company board) board would"".


All the other positions in TV can be chosen by the above (head + board), but considering both are chosen by one person there is a possibility that it may be biased (yeah...).


Right now, a couple of TV and radio head, directors and reporters resigned. The government also stated that ""every reporter that has been unbiased up to now [that is during the opposing political party reign] can be sure to stay at his position. Every biased reporter will loose his/her job"".

That pew poll result didn't actually scale up in real life, in fact it was so far off the mark that it calls into question the methodology used.

The reason why these results could be seen as misleading is there is no sociodemographic breakdown of the types of Muslims that responded to the poll.  We have no idea whether these were Salafists, whether they were poor, whether they were educated, employed or so on. So we simply don't know who responded to this survey. That's a gaping hole right there in their methodology. 

Yes it matters, it matters because lumping all views together creates a false  impression. 

Take the example (from the excellent Israel Democracy Index) of Israeli Jews asked in 2013 whether it would bother them if they  lived next to a homosexual person they gave this range of responses 

http://i.imgur.com/Fy2BdNV.png

The average of those responses would be 40% were bothered having a gay couple living next door, yet the range of responses is between 17.6% and 68.4% depending on religious perspective. 

By conflating these responses together you are not being given a complete picture.

It costs money to have the Sheriffs perform an investigation of the debtor and you have to put cash up front if you actually want the Sheriff to sell the debtor's property at auction. Only if the proceeds of the auction cover your up front costs do you get anything back and usually it is pennies on the dollar. I guess what I'm getting at is that while there may be protections in place against frivolous lawsuits, it is still going to cost you a lot of time, money, or both with the likelihood of recovering any money very low.

&gt; &amp;quot;There is every reason to expect that IS, IS-inspired terrorists or another religiously-inspired terrorist group will undertake a terrorist attack somewhere in Europe again, but particularly in France, intended to cause mass casualties among the civilian population,&amp;quot; it concluded.

&gt; &amp;quot;Operatives are also trained in clandestine actions and counter-surveillance. The nature and structure of the training apparently enables IS operatives to execute terrorist acts in an emotionally detached manner, as demonstrated in the shootings in Paris.

"Children have not always been raised by a mother and father. In some cultures the men have nothing to do children and they are completely raised by women. Some, the mother's family raises the child, but the father and his family are not involved. Some, boys and girls are raised separately. Some, all children are raised communally.

Then you have circumstantial situations where children are raised by a single parent, grandparents, other relatives, adoptive parents, foster families, orphanages, etc.

Just because you have apparently have a problem with homosexuality doesn't mean they can't raise children just as well as any of the previous examples. Are you worried that by being raised by loving and supportive gay couple, children might grow up by with a positive view of homosexuals?",12

So in the end a national referendum is needed to decide if it needs to be prohibited or not.

And if such a referendum's outcome says: ""do not ban the burqa"", then democracy said it is fine to stay.

But ofc the answer could as well be: ""do ban the burqa"", this way the democracy said it needs to go.

&gt;The four Great Powers are committed to Zionism...

Right off the bat. Zionism, the belief that Jews deserve a state in that land.

The British, as the book details, pulled back when clashes began with Arab rioting in 1920 and 1921. The Churchill White Paper sought to claim there would be no state, to walk back the public commitment. Peter Mansfield wrote:

&gt;""Although the Zionists were prepared to make tactical compromises of the kind which produced the Balfour Declaration, there can be no doubt that their true aim was to turn Palestine into the national home for the Jews to which most of the Jews in the world would want to emigrate. They might have differed over its precise borders, but in their view Palestine was to become a Jewish national state with a substantial Jewish majority. However, they had come to realize how difficult it might be to achieve this. Weizmann was surprised by how ‘non-Jewish’ Jerusalem and Palestine had become. He left after a few months, believing that it might be impossible to prevent Palestine from becoming an Arab state.""

Balfour wrote, in fuller:

&gt;“The four great powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long tradition, in present needs, in future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land”

"Allah is not the same God as the Christians or Jews have.


Christians believe that Muhammad was (one of the thousands) of false prophets warned about in the Bible; he's a fraud, a warlord lusting for power.

According to Judaism, God granted the land is Israel to Jews. Jews are his Chosen People. So, how is it that a Muslim can deny this, if they have the same God?

So what? Lmfao. You're blaming the fucking weather? This reads like a goddamn Onion article.

&gt;they created an empire that spanned the entire globe. You don't achieve what they did by being inept.

They were good at doing what they did: conquest, imperialism, exploitation in pursuit of the enrichment of the metropolis, the home country. Whatever administration they established was singularly devoted towards that cause. Crime is, of course, terrible for business, so yeah crime was kept artificially low as a result.

I mean ""artificial"" in the sense that I believe crime is born of people's material circumstances and generally fluctuates as a function of that. [Societies with greater levels of inequality (of all sorts) and poverty have more crime](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime%26Inequality.pdf):

&gt;The relationship between inequality and crime has also been the subject of sociological theories on crime. Broadly speaking, these have developed as interpretations of the observation that “with a degree of consistency which is unusual in social sciences, lower-class people, and people living in lowerclass areas, have higher official crime rates than other groups. ""One of the leading sociological paradigms on crime, the theory of “relative deprivation,”
states that inequality breeds social tensions as the less well-off feel dispossessed when compared with wealthier people (see the work by Steven Stack for a critical view). The feeling of disadvantage and unfairness leads the poor to seek compensation and satisfaction by all means, including committing crimes against both poor and rich.""

However, the government can ""artificially,"" via draconian and totalitarian methods, decrease this level of crime; but all this does is mask up underlying issues and of course necessarily means a reduction in personal freedom and an increase in governmental power. Time and time again, it's a temporary bandaid that inevitably comes off. Examples including Assad and Saddam in the Middle East, as well as apartheid South Africa.

All getting rid of apartheid did was lay bare the existing racial and economic problems that were being masked by a fundamentally undemocratic government.

&gt;When they got to SA the underclass already existed, they just used force to keep the locals ""in check"" instead of trying to bring them up to speed education-wise.

Mortgage lenders kept making (sub-prime) loans due to the fact that investment banks used the loans to create securities that hid risk (mortgage backed-derivatives).

The investment banks created these securities (CDOs)for years while the ratings agencies advertised false risk ratings (AAA on securities that were 50-60% toxic) because they were being paid directly by the investment banks to rate their own securities.  While the market was becoming permeated with these bad investments, the investment banks used hedge funds (shadow banking) to bet against the entire housing industry and by extension the entire economy.  They along with other investors also bought insurance on these CDOs from insurance companies like AIG, which collapsed under the weight of all the toxic loans due to terrible business practices (letting multiple investors insure the same product, showering bonuses instead of making sure they had enough money to cover the insurance on the CDOs).

A more realistic way of implementation might be hiding that private key, even from the government, and that if it needs to be used, it would be executed by a computer where you supply multiple authorizations (like an m-of-n scheme, think Bitcoin Multi Sig Wallets). Maybe a 2-of-3 example where law enforcement has to sign, then a judge, or someone from the executive branch + judge. Once they authorize the use, the master key does't just get revealed. You plug the suspect's HD into a computer where it now decrypts everything without ever revealing the master key.

Anyhow obviously such a system isn't trivial to implement and in order to do it without the master key leaking is extremely tough.",3

"People really want to portray refugees and migrants as either ""good guys looking for shelter and a home"" or ""vile creatures bringing their culture and expecting the host country to cater to them"". The honest truth is it is a bit a both, and it's ignorant to not look at both sides. 

These people are looking for jobs and shelter, but they have to realize the west has a different culture than their own. And many will adapt just fine. But there are going to be a percentage of people who don't change or don't think they have to change their ways when entering a new country. This **is** an issue that can't be ignored. 

Like in America, we have the hard working Mexican immigrants who bust their ass doing physical labor jobs. Then you have the much smaller (but still significant) portion that refuses to learn English, refuses to work hard, tries to get as many handouts as they can, and expects America to cater to them. They give a bad name to Mexican immigrants everywhere who are just trying to get by. 

Of course, it's not just migrants either. We have a huge portion of both whites and blacks who grew up here in America abusing the welfare system, spending their money on booze and drugs and getting food stamps and refusing to change their ways. And we're *still* debating on whether to give drug tests before handing out food stamps, etc. 

The big problem here is everyone has their rotten apples. But we've (somewhat) worked through trial and error to accommodate the domestic ones at home. When you have a huge influx of foreigners, some of them are promised to be rotten as well. But it's much more difficult to deal with *more* than we're used to, *and* these ones have a different culture, so our current methods dealing with our 'rotten apples' might not be applicable. 

Tl;dr: every country has shitty people, we've figured out how to deal with ours already. With new people coming in, we haven't figured out how to deal with their shitty people portion yet, and it happens and should be addressed. ",1

&gt;You personally may not like ibn taymiyyah and his predecessors but that doesn't change the fact that most sunnis follow his teachings and hold him in high esteem.

As I said majority of muslims that know him and his ""anti-"" whatever will agree harming innocents is not islamic. Sorry thats the truth end all be all.

&gt;you have a highly regarded theologian that's calls shia Kaffir and should be killed, 

People respect american presidents does that mean everything they did was honorable, for the good and so on? Nope he had other great works again he's not the father of all sunnis so stop trying to put him in such a high place because he for whatever reason called for war against shia. For all we know he may have meant groups within the shia majority that did something but we won't know until we ask him and thats not possible.

&gt;Where do you get the info that the Prophet said about insulating other then from sunni hadiths of bukhari and ibn taymiyyah etc.
[here](http://www.sunnah.org/aqida/respect.htm) also I follow hadiths but you seem to have a disconnect between hadiths about the prophet and fatwas which is what i believe your trying to say about ib taymiyyah RA. 

&gt;The thing with shia they don't sugar coat the actions of the ""shaba"" like sunnis do. 

Good on them.

&gt;many sunnis have this mentality that shia should be killed for exposing the actions of some of th sahaba.

I'm not even gonna touch this as it has no merit whatsoever. People will kill for the dumbest of reasons if you want to assign blame then assign blame to the guilty not every one remotely associated with the guilty.

&gt;The shia from the beginning till now are the same.

This is a fallacy in and of itself. 

&gt;Stop using semantics to try to slander shia.

You keep assigning blame but don't want to clarify so thanks for nothing.

The entire ruling class-working class war of 200+ years is reduced to a few symbols, which doesn't pass along the understanding that this exact same struggle continues today, except the workers have lost so much ground that most don't even fight. 

The history books don't seem to be written to convey that the war between the rulers and the rest of us is the central struggle of civilization. I believe this has a lot to do with how the ruling classes present history to the poor as a big series of unconnected accidents occurring whenever. If it was presented as the ruling class learns history, ie with the specific names of the specific individuals who precipitated the crises and wars and treaties, along with who was backing them and why, then regular people might finally understand that history is a shell game being played to distract the poor while stealing the entire product of our collective labor.

Couldn't it be argued that a *Burka* is temporary dress for use in *social situations*? Remove the words Burka and 'social situations' and plug-in snowboarder and 'when snowboarding' and the argument is the same. You've only 'stepped back' the problem into a definition over the term 'temporary'.

You can't, by definition. But isn't the erecting of said wall a person's free right? 

--

&gt;In an ideal world that shouldn't be an issue, but as two cultures are facing such strong pressure to integrate in such a short time perhaps drawing the line at what is culturally appropriate even in liberal europe (a lot but not a permanent face covering) may not be a bad idea.

--

You'll only give Muslims more ammunition, sowing the seeds of malcontent among their communities, while segregating out those people fervent enough to disregard the ban and instead opt to stay at home. 

--

This is one of those areas America simply does smarter. Perhaps because America's already quite religious (unlike some parts of Europe) these populations find it easier to relate and exchange culturally. They're free to wear whatever they want, businesses have to provide reasonable accommodations, and everyone is free to say what they want (little-to-nil libel laws). The end result of which is (seemingly) a more moderate Muslims population better integrated into society and more readily accepting western morality.

"Thank you for your very/completely one sided view.

Here is the otherside, the side which explains why there were protests and a civil war in the first place.

If all this were true then why was there any dissent against Gaddafi in the first place? NATO bombings didn't start the widespread protests against his rule, Gaddafi had lost multiple cities to the rebels  by the end of February 2011. NATO intervention didn't begin until March 19th. That clearly shows that you're either wrong about there being no civil war before NATO intervention or just lying about it. Many people would say that the war began when Gaddafi's forces fired at protesters in Benghazi on February 15th, or in the following days when Gaddafi's forces continued to put down protests by killing the protesters. 

This all leads onto the question of why there was dissent against a leader who sounds just perfect. Maybe because in 1973 he banned political dissent and often broadcast executions of the opposition on public television. That sounds rather dictatorial.

You said that Libya was a real democracy, which to a certain extent was true. Aside from the small things in that political parties were banned, striking was banned and whilst you could vote for local leaders you could not replace Gaddafi, there was no system for removing his monarchy and why would there be? He didn't come to power legitimately, he came to power in a military coup, he snuffed out any and all opposition because he wanted to stay in power. Libya was nothing more than a faux democracy.

You also said that he was ""100%"" against terrorism, and again to a certain extent he was. He was 100% against Islamic fundamentalist terrorism, not because that was the right thing to do but because he thought they represented a threat to his regime as they could be a point around which opposition groups could gravitate. In regards to other forms of terrorism he was very much for it, the 1986 Berlin disco bombing which killed 3 people and injured 200+ more was planned by the Libyan secret service. Then you've got the 1988 Lockerbie bombing which killed 270 people which Libya admitted responsibility for in 2003. So he was against terrorism when terrorism was against him. Let's also remember that he armed the IRA. Sending arms is a form of support, the IRA are a terrorist organisation, therefore it's pretty clear that Gaddafi supported terrorists.

Gaddafi was a dictator whatever way you spin it.",11

"&gt; To a lot of people communism is one of those idealist systems that just hasn't been applied right

Communism is a system that has not been established. If you look at the original definitions of communism, countries like the USSR or China or Cuba didn't even make it close to fulfilling them. The promise was that they would establish a system that would eventually lead to communism.

The struggle with communism is about finding the right institutions that can create and maintain communism. This is very comparable to the struggle of finding democratic institutions back in the 18th century (and the many failed attempts before that). Democracy relates to feudalism on a state level much the same way communism relates to capitalism on an economic level - the dissolution of absolutist power structures centered around individuals (royals and the nobility / owners of capital) in favour of a democratically organised system of everyone who has part in the whole (every citizen in case of a state democracy - every worker in case of communism).

But if we look at those in the former Soviet Union who want the USSR back, they don't even demand that much. They just want the USSR back, whatever exactly that was. It wasn't really capitalist nor communist. Some say it was socialist, some even call it bureaucratic feudalism. 

In any case the implementation of capitalism in Russia is both terrifingly corrupt and creates masses of crass losers, so it's no surprise that they want an alternative. Whether their wish for the USSR is just nostalgia or naive optimism or based on an actually realistic disadvantage/benefit estimation, there is something going wrong as it is.",44

&gt; NEW DELHI: With Chinese nuclear and conventional submarines regularly popping up in the Indian Ocean Region, India has now begun to deploy its latest long-range maritime patrol aircraft as well as spy drones at its forward military base in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

&gt; Defence ministry sources on Monday said two of the country&amp;#039;s most potent submarine hunters/killers, the naval Poseidon-8I aircraft, are just about to complete their first-ever two-week deployment to the strategically-located Andaman and Nicobar archipelago.

&gt; &amp;quot;AThe case for acquisition of another four P-8Is is in the final stages. P-8Is can operate from Port Blair to keep tabs on the entire region,&amp;quot; said the source.

A cooperation based system that was equitable could provide great lives for all, partly by being immensely less wasteful. The consumption society we've set up produces gigantic piles of garbage products that break almost instantly and have to be replaced (by design), to pick just one immense source of inefficiency and waste.

Everything is a social construct, though. Human rights are a good social construct.

Would the Pakistani government tolerate cutting people's hands off or whipping and stoning people in the streets? 

There has to be a measure of oversight over governing bodies for this very reason. Many people pontificate that this can't be done on a global scale, but it should be done over governments we are intimately connected to. Furthermore, the lessons of the Arab Spring have taught us that it might not necessarily be prudent for the majority of the people to let a strong populist Islamic movement to take over a country.",10

You would like to think it creates life, but with huge algae blooms the oxygen in the water there is taken in mainly by them so instead of creating life you actually kill things in the surrounding area.  Some small organisms in the area may survive but for the most part it kills even small fish (like herring or pilchards), so in that way it makes it worse.  Deep water farms are a good alternative, but they are extremely expensive and still do not solve the underlying problem of the waste in the water.  The best option is land based farming of fish, but to do that effectively you need a feed, which is often made of low trophic level fish.  That is causing overfishing and major issues -to solve it you need to start finding food alternatives, the most common now is fly larva, but it has not been developed enough yet. The whale theory I don't know but I would guess that because they are eating natural foods which would act as a sort of oceanic manure.  Fish farms do no act like that at all. ",1

But BBC and CNN all receive open or indirect funding from the UK and USA. Most media groups even Murdoch are heavily leaned upon or self censor. They wouldn't get a licence otherwise.

By the way the legitimate Ukrainian government was reported in many countries (except US and UK media) to have been overthrown by Western backed militia and not a spontaneous coup. Many senior US government and commercial officials were reported having secret meetings  with far right Nazi linked groups who are now terrorizing even the current western backed Ukrainian  regime.

Maybe 10 years ago 'racist' and 'fascist' would be effective slurs, but now that the EU is broke and feeling the effects of mass migration I fail to see how such slurs still hold value. Articles like that remind me of the first paragraph of Revilo Oliver's book - The Jewish Strategy:

'IT IS A GRIM AND TERRIBLE FACT that most of the members of our own race have had their minds so deformed by centuries of cunning Jewish propaganda that they have been conditioned, as effectively as well-trained dogs, to snarl and bite when their Jewish masters utter certain key-words, such as ""fascist,"" ""racist,"" and the like, which take the place of the ""sic 'em to which dogs respond. They are, furthermore, so emotionally addicted to narcotic fantasies that many of them are both unwilling and unable to endure the distress of looking at the real world about them and thinking rationally about it. They understandably prefer to close tightly the eyes of their minds and live in the dream-world of pleasurable fairy tales, such as they heard in the childhood to which they subconsciously long to regress. As Kipling neatly characterized them, ""If they desire a thing, they declare it is true. If they desire it not, though that were death  itself, they cry aloud, 'It has never been!'""

If this was an LLC, you'd be paying in the high 30's%, yes, compared to the C corp paying 34% and then you paying 15%.  So taxes for you would likely be higher under a C corp and you'd end up with less money.

Back in the nineties a whole bunch of them undersigned a lettter to the effect that iq tests test intelligence, and do so well. Which you'd know if you were better informed and talked to them, and read the polls that they did in the past on the subject.

Yes coaching improves scores; not by much.

If you want to see what they can really do, motivate them with a reward. They'll end up in the same place relative to each other, although the odd bright slacker will suddenly improve their score.

IQ test results are predictable from brain size, and they are a good indicator of life outcome, partcularly educational outcomes. Unrelated infants raised as twins have a near random relation to each other for IQ, which really sinks the idea that it's down to environment/can be learned.

IQ tests are not ""fucking exams"", they are tests. There is a difference.

She is a war hawk, though just like Bush. But it wasn't her alone (it's more a testament to the corruption of business in American politics) but the reasons for every invasion in Middle East by The West were never what we were told (i.e. Human Rights Violations). Syria, Libya, Iraq were all propagandized. I don't know as much about Saddam because I haven't researched him as in depth, but Assad and Gaddafi are/were both loved by their people and the government (followed by media parroting and afraid to question the status quo) spreads lies about the genocide and chemical attacks. MIT and the UN both release reports denying Assad's use of chemical weapons.

Recent emails released by HRC pertaining to the FOIA request and FBI investigation are now opening the eyes of what many already knew prior about this administration (as well as Bush for that matter).
Gaddafi was Africa's wealthiest state and it is turned to ruins now- Gaddafi loved his people and shared all the oil wealth with them housing and educating them; he was an idealist, if not a little bizarre, yes. But Ghadaffi did amazing things for that nation, the only reason he was taken out is because he attempted to create an African currency which would have threatened Opec's petrodollar.

Assad/Syria was a beautiful country prior and very westernized. Islamic extremists armed by American CIA backers fight Assad to implement more radical policy because he isn't Muslim enough for them. Assad refuses to be a Western puppet and allow an energy pipeline benefiting the west to go through Syria, so we make him the bad guy.

Now, explain to me how your link in any way backs up the claim. Let's take a look at your first link:

&gt;But the full context of Obama’s remark points to an important distinction between Islam and the extremist ideology that’s sweeping parts of Iraq and Syria. “No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL’s victims have been Muslim,” Obama said. “ISIL is a terrorist organization, pure and simple. And it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way.”

&gt;...

&gt;But ISIS clearly has little regard for this or other fundamental tenets of Islam. They have sparked the rage of Iraqi Muslims by carelessly blowing up copies of the Qur’an, and they have killed their fellow Muslims, be they Sunni or Shia. Even extremist Muslims who engage in warfare have strict rules of engagement and prohibitions against harming women and children, but ISIS has opted to ignore even this by slaughtering innocent youth and using rape and sexual slavery as a weapon.

That's the gist of that link.

Next link is a facebook post that has a video of someone explaining this issue. Cool. 

Third link:

&gt;The impulse to separate Islam from the sins and crimes of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is understandable, and it often includes statements such as ISIS has “nothing to do with Islam” or that ISIS is merely “using Islam” as a pretext. The sentiment is usually well-intentioned. We live in an age of growing anti-Muslim bigotry, where mainstream politicians now feel license to say things that might have once been unimaginable.

&gt;To protect Islam—and, by extension, Muslims—from any association with extremists and extremism is a worthy cause.

&gt;But saying something for the right reasons doesn’t necessarily make it right. An overwhelming majority of Muslims oppose ISIS and its ideology. But that’s not quite the same as saying that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam, when it very clearly has something to do with it.

No links to who exactly is saying ""ISIS has nothing to do with Islam"", though.

"I think you completely misunderstand world affairs here, and that's okay, but let me dive deeper here.  First off, we no longer live in a US global hegemony.  That ended in 1970.  Nations no longer rule this world, at least like they used to.  The US was the last imperium, a necessary sacrifice to fulfill their century-long geopolitical goal of ending world war by deconstructing mercantilism(Great Powers in Europe sub WWI) and neo-mercantilism(USSR, fake ""Communism"" in the PRC and elsewhere).

Secondly, the neoliberal, Washington Consensus, integrated legal-rational system the US advocates around the world is directly responsible for development of most of the former third world, and the most peaceful period in history.  Virtually the entire world has adopted this system, including Russia and the PRC to a degree, because everyone benefits from it, and it ultimately levels the playing field.  Those are the facts. The IMF projects India, the PRC, the US, and finally Brazil as the largest economies by 2100.  A truly multi-polar world for the first time in history.

Third, and most critically, is the realization that all nations behave based on interest.  As a liberal democracy, the interests of the US have been highly progressive and responsive to its multicultural and ideologically diverse population.  India and Brazil will follow to a degree as it steps into the world stage in the coming decades.  This is less the case in nondemocratic states like Russia, or the PRC.  Their interests reflect a very small portion of the population.  Not because they are evil, or stupid, but because it is difficult to run a nation or world full of complexities as a small group of isolated people who are not threatened or heavily influenced by the will of the masses.  Of course, there are ways to bend the masses to their will, in vice versa, methods of drumming up ancestral ideology or patriotism, instigating an environment of threats from historical rivals to mobilize the people to your side, etc.  I could go on and on as to what the world would look like under a global regime ran by an unchecked actor that follows such a worldview.  Look how destabilized the Asia-Pacific is because one actor set the domino off by employing ancestral rights(the Nine-Dash line) over multilateral legal-rational rights.

Point is, we need a liberal democracy as the preeminent influence on global affairs and systems.  Doesn't have to be solely the US, and it hasn't since the 70s.  As the century concludes, we will very likely see countries like India and Brazil, and the EU, calling a huge portion of the shots.",4

The West figured out women's rights. Now we need to figure out how to teach it to people who still think women are property, who still think women deserve to be molested and raped for going out at night to have fun. But we can't fix their broken mindset if every incident is hidden, if every victim is silenced. Now is the time for an international discussion, and we need the voice of the victims.

I have heard them in private conversation. I have heard from women who were sexually assaulted by gangs of men, who were surrounded and molested in clubs, by attackers who invariably fit a certain profile. In Toronto. In Ottawa. Now I am hearing that it is happening in the UK, in Sweden, in Germany. We need to stop having these conversations in private. We need to discuss the victimization very publicly. This is a culture war we are waging now, and it is won by a public discussion.

To the past victims over the years: everyone told you to move on. And you did. You put it behind you and you showed your strength, and you recovered from what happened.

"How about Canada (a country 1/10th the size of the US) taking in 10 000 refugees successfully with another 15 000 on the way. If we can manage that many in a smaller country than your, surely the US can manage 100 000. Although, it seems as though the US lately has problems managing their own population let alone another group of refugees.

N.B. I'm mostly playing devil's advocate. Taking in 100 000 of ANY kind of people is going to be a bit of an issue. However, the US and Canada are in a unique position to be able to cherry pick the refugees they let in.

"The stormfront logic for blaming Jews for historical antisemitism. First off, the 109 countries people cite is way the fuck off. The amount of times this number is repeated shows how willing people are to repeat antisemitic libels without scrutiny. 

The 109 number is arrived at by citing every city within a country and every instance. So Germany alone is counted two dozen times, repeatedly listing Bavaria and Germany and the different cities. The same is done with France, and Poland and so on. You'll see this 109 number repeated everywhere nevertheless, in this thread as well. Look up the list for yourself and see how many countries it comes to. 

But regardless the number of countries - the point you are making the Jews are at fault for their being repeatedly persecuted. Now if we look at these expulsions, they mostly occur in middle ages in Europe. Looking at the reasons, the Crusades were the impetus for the worst atrocities, additionally the Jews were often accused of using blood of Christian children for their rites, Jews were responsible for the black plague.

Jews were often given the choice to convert or die, or specifically given the choice to convert to be spared from expulsion or death. So the Jews that converted stopped being assholes, per this logic, the second that they embraced Jesus. 

Nevertheless, ignoring the role that Christian hegemony played in this throughout the Crusades and the middle ages is vile. The idea that Jews are to blame for the consequences of their long diaspora and always being in the minority, thus the first to be scapegoated - is equally vile. As are you. ",0

"Ok, let's begin

&gt; a 2013 court ruling by the Dominican Constitutional Court that essentially stripped thousands of people without one Dominican parent of their right to citizenship

Yeah, that is the law. You can be a resident, but being a citizen requires a little more. The requirements used to be quite lenient: ""you have a dominican parent?"" you need to get a couple dominicans who can vouch for you"". As we can imagine, that system was abused, because people lie. Now everybody needs their ID papers, simple as that.

&gt;Those who missed the deadline for registration are fearful of deportation

The deadline was over a year long. An entire year to get their IDs, and they didn't get it. What happened then? The government extended the deadline another year, then another 3 months. And people still didn't get them. Why, you may ask? You need some ID from Haiti to support your own papers in the DR, if you're an immigrant, to prevent further abuses. So what happened in Haiti? Their government charged their own people hundreds of USD to get their papers, effectively ruining their chances of getting a citizenship in the DR.

&gt;It’s not unusual to hear some Dominicans complain of a Haitian “invasion""

After the earthquake in Haiti, thousands and thousands of haitians came to the DR. No papers, no documents, everything paid for by the dominican government. They were supposed to leave two years after that, but they stayed, and brought their families. The official number is there are around 300,000 haitians illegally in the DR, but other estimates place the number above 1 million. That's around the number of refugees accepted in Germany. Now think about that, a First World Nation, the largest economy in Europe barely has money to support 1 million people with an entirely different background; and you expect a Third World Nation, with a GDP of 60bn to be able to do it? Come on, no wonder the DR's governemnt wants them out, it's not just because of the lack of money, but because they're here illegally! You wanna help them?

I don't think this accurately reflects how political coalitions work.

To make a long story short, a democracy empowers all of its citizens to influence its government. If you allow millions of people with strong theocratic preferences into your country, you should expect that over time the policy balance of the country moves toward their preferences.

&gt; Worst case scenario, Europe becomes a little more like America... which is the center of modern Western civilization and is doing just fine.

America does not have this proportion of Islamic citizens, nor are the Islamic citizens that America has as extreme in their views as the rank and file of states like Syria or Iraq.

"The history of anti-semitism has largely been influenced by the Catholic Church, which helped spread rumours and lies about Jews across Europe. Things got worse after the Reformation, since Martin Luther was a raging anti-semite who went around preaching that Jews should be hung lower than thieves, among other things, probably as a consequence of his being a Catholic monk or whatever he was. He was very much admired by Hitler, by the way, can't put my finger as to why...

As far as antisemitism in the Middle-East, that can be attributed to Islam, since Jews refused to join Mohammad's religion, and as a consequence the Qur'an has parts saying that in the last days even the rocks will cry for Jews to be killed. 

Interesting history about it: Mohammad had to flee Mecca at one point because people wanted to kill him, and he took refuge with a tribe of Arabian Jews who took care of him. After a while, he started to preach his religion to those Jews, and they kept asking for evidence of his claims, of which he had none, so Mohammad slaughtered them.

Final point about the stereotype of Jews being overly interested in money: that came to pass because Christians were, at one point, forbidden from handling money, and the task was explored by Jewish merchants, who were good at it and prospered. Time went on and people started to believe Jews were back-stabbing covetous people.  ",6

"The source of the problem being politicians who are either dead or not having been in power for decades. Right, bullshit. 

Ultimately every individual is responsible for what they personally do, these migrants are as responsible for their own behaviour as much as anyone else is. If you don't agree, are you willing to shift the blame further back? Those US politicians themselves were only products of the culture and the system that produced them, after-all. They existed, reacting to the stimulus the world provided them in the same way that these migrants and all of us do.

Maybe this is really a result centuries, no, millennia in the making! It's not the US politicians' fault, they were affected by the creation of their country via Imperial Europe's politics. But those European empires were heavily influenced by countless earlier powers, so let's actually blame Rome! But Rome only took what the Greeks and Egyptians had started and ended up conquering both, so really it's those earlier civilizations' fault! 

But wait, if Mesopotamia hadn't gotten the ball rolling on this whole massive civilization form of existence, others wouldn't have been inspired to do the same! Mesopotamia is a name for the area of the Tigris–Euphrates river system, roughly corresponding to modern-day Iraq, Syria and Kuwait, including regions along the Turkish-Syrian and Iran–Iraq borders. Clearly, the area of the world that is currently most fucked by this calamity-du-jour is responsible for it, it's the end result of what started there 4 or 5 thousand years ago. 

This is why not holding individuals accountable for their own acts is fucking stupid. If you're willing to ignore one person's self responsibility, you should logically find yourself on a never ending buck passing practice. But no, you'll only go back far enough to satisfy ""Poor these little people I fundamentally have no respect for, they don't know how to be people, their problems are someone else's fault so how could they ever solve themselves?""

"&gt; Gaddafi was going down no matter what. 

This is wholly inaccurate. By mid-March Qaddafi's forces were on the verge of defeating the uprising and capturing the last rebel stronghold of Benghazi. At that time the death toll was only just over 1,000 (including soldiers and rebels). With the conflict nearing its conclusion, Libyan expatriates in Switzerland loyal to the rebel cause decided to claim that there was an impending ""bloodbath"" tantamount to genocide about to occur in Benghazi. Without any evidence to suggest that this was true, NATO allies ate up the propaganda and decided to intervene. The intervention was an abject failure. One of the most stable states in all of Africa quickly deteriorated into a failed state. It also destabilized the region (we've seen more issues in Mali and Burkino Faso that are spillovers from the conflict in Libya). The rebellion was very nearly defeated and would have been defeated had it not been for the NATO intervention. ",1

Today things are fairly stagnant, the only areas of economic activity are fruit growing/exports, telecommunications, construction, military manufacturing and a tiny tourism industry consisting of ~100,000 mostly Chinese tourists per year, some consumer manufacturing hubs coordinated with China and the South, etc. The rest is composed of small family businesses/collectives sprinkled around the cities and towns, basically people selling stuff they import from China with their savings and foodstuffs they buy from farmers.

I totally agree.  My last job was at a nursing home doing human resources for 8 years and during that time we lost our holiday pay.  Affordable healthcare for families.  wages went stag and paid time off was tapered off and rigged into a penilizing system that discouraged employees to take time off.  This was the healthcare industry and they didn't give a dam about the well being of their employees.  Anything to turn a buck.  And believe me. It makes a difference in the care they gave to the patients.  #consulatehc.  Proud I got fired...  😛😛,2

Then Britain and Russia again needed money, and later much of Europe needed money for the war and to rebuild, the US stepped in again and said ""I'll put it on your tab"" and that caused the 50s and 60s to swell into a mini Renaissance of money and culture. ",4

From that source,
&gt; There have been more than 400,000 such “sea arrivals” in 2015, and 51 percent are Syrian. The rest have come mainly from nine other countries. Most of these refugees and migrants have been men — **72 percent** — but these are not figures on Syrian refugees or even solely the 200,000-some Syrians who have been willing to take some type of boat to reach Europe by sea.

So it's not just Syrians coming into these countries, but lots of different types of migrants. And most of these migrants are men. Refugees in the surrounding countries are basically the same ratios of men to women. These migrants are not the same ratio.",3

"&gt;  ISIS

The group was founded in 1999 by Jordanian radical Abu Musab al-Zarqawi under the name Jamāʻat al-Tawḥīd wa-al-Jihād (lit. ""The Organisation of Monotheism and Jihad"").[27] In October 2004, al-Zarqawi pledged allegiance (Bay'ah) to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and renamed the group to Tanẓīm Qāʻidat al-Jihād fī Bilād al-Rāfidayn (lit. ""The Organisation of Jihad's Base in Mesopotamia""), commonly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq or AQI. Under al-Zarqawi, the group participated in the Iraqi insurgency following the March 2003 invasion of Iraq by Western forces.

In January 2006, the group joined other Sunni insurgent groups to form the short-lived Mujahideen Shura Council. After al-Zarqawi was killed in June 2006, the Mujahideen Shura Council merged in October 2006 with several more insurgent factions to establish ad-Dawlah al-ʻIrāq al-Islāmiyah, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI),[58] led by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri,[59] who were killed in a US–Iraqi operation in April 2010, being succeeded by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as the group's new leader.

In August 2011, following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, ISI, now under the leadership of al-Baghdadi, delegated a mission into Syria, which under the name Jabhat an-Nuṣrah li-Ahli ash-Shām (or al-Nusra Front) established a large presence in Sunni-majority ar-Raqqah, Idlib, Deir ez-Zor, and Aleppo provinces. In April 2013, al-Baghdadi decreed the reunification of the Syrian al-Nusra Front with ISI to form the ""Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"" (ISIL). However, Abu Mohammad al-Julani and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leaders of al-Nusra and al-Qaeda respectively, rejected the merger. After an eight-month power struggle, al-Qaeda cut all ties with ISIL by February 2014, citing its failure to consult and ""notorious intransigence"".[3][52]

In early 2014, ISIL drove Iraqi government forces out of key cities in its Anbar campaign,[43] which was followed by the capture of Mosul[44] and the Sinjar massacre.[45] The loss of control almost caused a collapse of the Iraqi government and prompted a renewal of US military action in Iraq. In Syria, the group has conducted ground attacks on both government forces and rebel factions.

"&gt; China's policies existed to try and force industrialization within a 50 year timespan, and for the most part they succeeded, which is WHY they are booming, because investment in a high-density labour force is ideal for industrial capitalists.

Uh, no. China's ""communist"" policies under Mao to try to force industrialization were a massive failure. They never had a plan to ""force industrialization within a 50 year timespan."" They had a plan to force industrialization within 10 years, and it was a massive failure that literally shrunk their economy and killed tens of millions of people. Meanwhile, nearby countries and territories like Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong were actually achieving successfully achieving industrialization using capitalist economic policies. 

It wasn't until Mao died and China started adopting capitalist based market reforms that they started to successfully industrialize. 

Just imagine how much more powerful China might be today if they hadn't stunted their growth for decades with Mao's stupid policies.

"The differences come from the starting point. From your link in 1980 China started out at $309B nominal GDP while India started out with $181B nominal GDP. So right off the bat India started out at only 59% of China's economy. Couple that with the marginally higher growth rate yoy over 30 years and that's where the hundreds of billions of difference comes from.

[This graph](http://statisticstimes.com/economy/image/world/india-china-gdp-growth.jpg) is very interesting to me. In there you see the economic shocks in the 80s, 90s, and the 2000s. The slope of the changes shows that China has a way higher beta than India as corrolated to the world's economy, and thus when times are good the Chinese have higher growth rates, and when times are bad they have way sharper downturns. So it does lend truth to your earlier assertion that India's ""slow and steady"" but it's more towards ""steady"" and not much ""slow"". The origins of India's weaker nominal GDP comes from the their starting positions in the 80s. If you have data going further back to when their nominal GDPs were similar then we can have a much deeper analysis. ",8

"I'm an atheist but was brought up in a Fundamentalist Christian church. Turning the other cheek, offering to give your coat to someone if they try to steal it, doing unto others as you would have them do unto you etc. Fundamental Christian doctrine has nothing in it that read literally would incite anyone to harm another person. 
Its rarely practiced as Christ supposedly instructed. People pick and choose what they want.

Islam on the other hand has lots of verses in the Koran that taken literally, instruct killing people who commit blasphemy against the prophet, or  say that infidels should be killed. 

Most Muslims just like Christians,  also pick and choose what parts of the Koran they're going to obey.  Muslims never had a reformation as Christians did, but many became quite secular. Many Muslims don't read the Koran, they just accept they are Muslim as they've been raised. Too many don't even know about some of the outrageous versus in the Koran. Unfortunately, sometimes moderate Muslims for whatever reason, interact with Fundamentalists or radical Islamists who Introduce them to these more violent passages, and convince them that they aren't really Muslim if they don't practice it as the Prophet commanded. 

My point is even today people deny that the Taliban or ISIS are practicing Islam, but they are, in its fundamental form. Its simply not true to say these people are un-islamic. 

I've known many wonderful Muslims who are devout and kind, generous people who treated me as family. Its heartbreaking to know that despite how kind they are to me, that they believe the Koran is literally the word of God, and they believe I'm damned for eternity. Its also heartbreaking to know that while they don't talk about it much, I've had some of them admit to me that Homosexuals should be killed. These people are my friends. They live in Michigan and are raising children and walk amongst us, and if they had the political power to make it so, we all would be living under Sharia Law.  

I'm a liberal and it bothers me so much that other liberals attack people like myself as racist etc. because I don't want more Muslims here in America. They think its ignorance and fear about Muslims that make me believe that way, 

I think all Religion does more harm than good, but I also think some Religions especially Islam are worse than others.

Anyway, I sincerely apologize for going on about what I think, but its frustrating and painful that so many of my fellow liberals defend Islam, assuming so much about it.

While all these radars can be used to commit midcourse interceptors that have sufficient onboard sensing, autonomy, and divert capability to acquire and parse the threat complex during fly-out, **they offer little help in discrimination of decoys or other countermeasures.**

And a well known, and very capable S-Band radar system:

It all comes down to resolution and power.

X-band radars have far better resolution for the same power and thus can identify decoys from fighters better.

The S-300, and indeed most other ground based, very long range, air defense platforms use S-band radars.

These by their very nature, cannot achieve high resolution, so require much higher outputs to gain enough detail about their targets.

"&gt;  We trust government to work based on motives other than profit.

No we don't. We have measures, laws, etc, to enforce certain behaviors in a democratic system. Regulation of sorts is what would be needed. 

As it stands the government is the one institution in which people can affect via participation without institutional, systemic change. Not to say there aren't problems with our democracy in the US, however.


Personally I'm an  Anarchist/libertarian socialist so I am not pro-big government by any means (Though that would be preferable in the short run -  Social democracy, etc). I am in favor of a democratic economy in which workers own and operate the places in which they work, producing based on human need (socialism). In any Anarchist society a system of decentralized, bottom-up direct democracy takes place of government. Historical and present day examples of anarchist/socialist societies include - Revolutionary Catalonia, Anarchist Aragon, Shinmin Province in Korea/Manchuria, Free Territory of Ukraine, The Bavarian Soviet Republic, The Paris Commune, The Zapatista controlled areas of Chiapas (current day), Magonista Baja California, Shanghai People's Commune, Rojava (current day), etc.

"It's called a civilization. Islamic civilization. Easy word, no need to speak about it in hushed tones. It's pretty easy to distill the Islamic religion from the overall civilization though. For one thing, in Islamic culture, lay persons were never really taught (or sought) knowledge from the political, historical, or legal fields. So most Muslims, while cognizant of their religion, are actually quite ignorant about Islam as a civilization.

Islamic civilization ""officially"" ended with the end of the Ottoman Empire. What we see today are attempts to clone it from its dead carcass and they come up with mutants and abominations. So we're not seeing the Islamic civilization that was a trend setting world/historical power. We see mutants that have its DNA. And people don't remember the original, so they think the DNA in the mutant is actually uncorrupted and original and jump through mental hoops reconciling the abomination they see with the historical footprint. You can't reconcile it, but they try mightily.

That's a bit of a red herring though. Islamic civilization didn't die off completely, parts of it evolved into other things... including things we'd recognize now in Western civilization. But that's a more complicated subject better fit for a more appropriate subreddit. A subreddit where people don't make the logical equivalent of the mistake where they see every passing American on the street and pretend as if they're responsible for every crime committed by the American government or people wanting to take over the American government, past present and future (it's really, really ironic that Islamist extremists and white supremacists in the West (and many in this subreddit) think exactly the same way).",33

"&gt;Germany doesn't have the capability to wipe out the Middle East. Not only that but they really have no reason to. Deportation and closing borders is a far more simple, practical, and ethical solution to their problem. 

Maybe they'll call in Donald Trump in the white house?  Although Germany isn't that weak a military power even alone.

But thank you for admitting death is at least unethical.  Not sure if it's more complex or 'practical' though cause a bullet takes out an immigrant far faster than a plane can deport them.  And that bullet costs less than even the fuel to take them to the police station/boarder. 

Honestly if one doesn't care about the ethics of murder, murder really is the most efficient and easy method of permanently solving the 'issue'.

If one cares about ethics, then I think we have the responsibility to not engage in that.

&gt;Also the US isn't going to nuke or wipe out the Middle East. The US is in fact allied with many Middle Eastern countries like Turkey, Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc. Also it has no reason to wipe out or nuke the Middle East as well. 

Other than fear and blind paranoia about ""Muslims and terrorists"", you're correct.  Fear and hatred though have taken a center stage for violent actions that otherwise we would say have no reason to be done.  Hatred *is* that reason and motivator.  ""They kill us, so we bomb indiscriminately"" as Ted Cruz oddly advocated for makes it clear that just hating ""Islam"" appears sufficient to ignore Muslim casualties in the region.  Hopefully Germany does not match the rhetoric flying around in the US.

&gt;Also if Trump wins... overall it won't mean much. Congress and the Supreme Court won't let him enact his crazy ideas. Congress MIGHT cooperate on any sensible ideas he brings up (if any) assuming Congress isn't too busy fighting amongst itself. 

Again, I hope this is true.  But there are a fair number of war hawks on both sides of the political isle.  I don't want to know what they'd do with a leader who clearly wants to rush headfirst into atrocities.  I *hope* they would stop him.

&gt; There is a connection between the immigrant flow to Germany and the sexual assaults in Cologne, Tatjana Festerling, one of the key-figures in German anti-immigrant Pegida group, told RT. Al least eight people involved in attacks on women on New Year&amp;#039;s Eve &amp;quot;Had their asylum seeking papers with them,&amp;quot; she said.

&gt; The police shouldn&amp;#039;t be blamed for the Cologne events as it&amp;#039;s simply overwhelmed by the amount of people arriving in Germany despite having no right for political refugee status, Michael Opperskalski, the editor in chief of local magazine, Geheim, said.

"It's due completely to the issues that translated texts, especially lengthy ones, have with completely capturing the original message of the text completely accurately. The contents of the Quran, as the Muslims believe, is the actual, literal word of god spoken in Arabic to Muhammad, and to translate that into any other language dilutes/muddies it to the point where it's not a true Quran because those are literally not God's words. The only way a translated Quran can still be considered a real Quran is if it also has the pure Arabic text version as well.

Because of this, there isn't confusion or debate over the meaning of the text of the Quran itself to anywhere near the same degree there is over the Christian bible, which is fueled in part due to the massive number of slightly, or even very different translations of it. Unlike the average bible, any Quran printed today has the exact same text as one printed over a thousand years ago.

This, and the way the Quran is worded, has worked very well at helping to keep Islam from spitting into a gazillion sects like Christianity has: http://www.truthforsaints.com/Christian_Denominations/denomination_history/files/denominations_family_tree_truthforsaints.png

Islam instead has three branches with sub schools within them. ~85% of Muslims are of the Sunni branch. The debate within Islam mainly derives from differences over certain Hadiths (quotes from Muhammad that are not from the Quran itself), and of course Muhammad's rightful successor.",1

"What you probably do not understand is that religious principles are often known to be false by those who promote them.  The intention is to lead and control followers by convincing them of the validity of their false principles.  This leads to the phenomenon of the naive repeating the lies as if they are truth as a secondary effect, hence the 'often' as used above.  The whole Christian system is based upon a hierarchy of cynical deception in this fashion.  This puts religious wars in proper perspective as the result of truly evil people enjoying the clash of civilizations as a matter of secret personal entertainment/achievement -- when it is not outright war for resources.  In this view, a religious creed, sect, denomination is little more than one team among a league of teams.  Needless to say, this perspective cannot be shared by the majority of the faithful as it is unreasonable to expect the officer grades to sacrifice their lives when the tradition is to leave that honour to lower ranks -- who think they're going to heaven anyhow.

"You have sought justification. I gave a succint truthful description of the conflict that supplies it. You have yet to refute even one word of what I said.

The terms you use - ethnic cleansing, slow genocide, are not mere exaggerations or hyperboles, they are libels. If you call farting next to someone ""slow murder"", you have an extreme bias. Calling one of the least lethal conflicts in history ""slow genocide"" is an extreme bias. Reality is sevral orders of magnitude far from your description of it. Your one sided cherry picking and distortion of facts cannot hide that. In this case, you have demonstrated a mathematically proven extreme bias against the Jews. This certain bias has a name - antisemitism. Granted, the Jewish people aren't a race, but a national-religious identity, but it is accepted to denote this bias racism in popular nomenclature. I don't know if you are a racist, I don't know you at all, but you use racist propaganda.

A few extras: Islam is an expansionist religion, whose main goal is uniting mankind under a single, god given political system - i.e. imperialistic. In lieu of that, it initiated and propelled the conquering of a huge long lasting empire, and continues to motivate large groups of people to try and reachieve that. It is imperialistic. These are facts. You know about the atrocities it motivates, but the term genocidal is justified by Arab muslim declarations, attempts and scriptural support at the genocide of the Jews, in context of this conflict.

Claiming ""ethnic cleansing"" (while ignoring the context and what the ""cleansed side"" was attempting at the time) does not negate the fact that this land is the one and only tiny indigenous land of the Jews who were persecuted everywhere else, and just another colony for the Arab expansionist imperialist ethnicity.

Regarding negotiating in bad faith. The Palestinians have refused many very generous offers of statehood, including one before their ""cleansing"". No separatist movement has offer declined such an offer. The Arabs declined at least 4, and some other peace offers, without even debating them. That is because they are not separatists, but imperialists. Is that negotiating in good faith?

Unfortunately you're lying, Germany allows a maximum of 500 x your age, so a 30 year old could have 15,000 saved and still go on ALG 2 (non-contribution unemployment) as long as they have no income, whereas this article says there is a hard limit of 750 for refugees regardless of age.

&gt; The terrorist broke into the Meir family home in the West Bank community of Otniel, near Hebron, just after 5:00 PM. He struggled with the victim, who had three children at home at the time, before stabbing her and fleeing the scene.

&gt; Ministers were presented with examples from children&amp;#039;s and youth programs on the official Palestinian Authority television channel featuring - inter alia - children calling for the murder of Jews, incitement by Palestinian Authority Chairman Abu Mazen encouraging terrorism, and incitement in new media.

"10% is not a tiny minority.

Within a generation their growth is estimated to be very, very high because these are 80-90% young adults coming in.

Blacks are 13% of America and they've had a massive impact. Saying 10-20% won't significantly affect life in Europe is retarded bullshit, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. The blacks are proof of this. They're a huge financial burden taking 40% of welfare along with a hugely disproportionate amount of almost all taxpayer funded services, they have massively high crime rates and they cause whites to flee any area they settle in in high enough numbers. Whites abandon schools, neighborhoods, entire cities sometimes, because of the presence of blacks. That's just a few examples of how they significantly affect life. They also affect government policy and politics significantly.

This is true of Muslims too wherever there's enough of them and it's already happening. 

They will make life in Europe worse, it's an objective fact. You pretend to offer some logical, fact-based perspective but in reality what you're doing is regurgitating what you've been trained to believe by your politicians, the mainstream media and the education system.

"The ""money they are getting"" is their own money that's been frozen in foreign accounts because they have been locked out of the banking system, mostly in China and India. Of the around 150 billion figure that's thrown around, over 100 billion is foreign reserve funds that can't be spent. Only a fraction of the rest actually belongs to the government of Iran.

Some make it sound like Iran is just being handed a bunch of American cash to spend on whatever it wants. That's not the case.

This money has been frozen on account of nuclear sanctions. It makes sense that it be released once the nuclear issue is resolved. It's understandable that the West has other expectations of Iran, whether justified or not, but to demand that Iran utterly conform to those expectations on every unrelated issue is an absolute non-starter. 

Change must come a step at a time. You negotiate every step carefully and consistently, then move on to the next, building trust along the way. Taking a nation's economy hostage and expecting them to make an about-face turn on all sensitive issues is just unrealistic.

The moderate faction of the Iranian regime has spent a huge amount of political capital in reaching this agreement. A few years ago even speaking to an American politician would have been treason and grounds for execution. The hard-liners in Iran have resisted every inch of compromise and have created as many obstacles as they possibly could have. 

The nuclear agreement has been a delicate balance in an intense tug-of-war with hard-liners in Iran and the US pulling hard on either end of the rope. There have been drawn-out arguments over single words in the final document (e.g. missiles ""capable of"" vs. ""designed for"" carrying nuclear warheads). 

The entire process has been possible because from day one it was decided to negotiate one issue at a time, with the nuclear one first. The mountain of outstanding disagreements makes it otherwise impossible to proceed diplomatically. It is hoped, and hinted though not overtly stated, that if this agreement succeeds there may be room for future ones dealing with other differences.

To suddenly step in at the end, say you disagree with the outcome because Iran did not change its entire behaviour, is frankly naive and simple-minded. Nobody is ignoring any issue. If you demand that Iran acknowledge Israel, pull out of Syria and Lebanon, immediately allow Western-style freedom of speech and free elections, release all political prisoners, etc., that's tantamount to demanding utter capitulation ""or else"". That's not how diplomacy works.

"A significant number of people across Europe are using refugees and other migrants as scapegoats. It's fucked up. Yes, some refugees and migrants are criminals or horrible people, although it should be noted that being a criminal or a horrible person does not mean you can be denied asylum or should be, for that matter. But recently it seems everything can be blamed on immigration. Homegrown, British raised IS terrorists coming from what people like Nick Griffin of the BNP would call 'ethnically British' (whatever that means), from a middle class background? Clearly, it's the refugees faults for somehow managing to indoctrinate him while fleeing Syria. 

There is a real and existing threat of IS members coming through pretending to be asylum seekers, and yes, some asylum seekers may not respect western values. Some may well be rapists, child abusers, proponents of forced marriage or even domestic violence. Unfortunately these cases are used against the majority, asylum seekers are now stereotyped as one group. Whereas before, a decade ago, refugees may well have been stereotyped as poor and destitute, now they're stereotyped as terrorists.

But whoever it is, if it turns into an economic game of chicken, Saudi can drag this well into the 2020s if not longer. ",3

"Isis might not want people to leave but right now they got other stuff on their plate. Also the assumption that if we don't accept refugees they will join ISIS is completely false. 

Many of the refugees from Pakistan and Afghanistan are nowhere near close to ISiS recruitment pool. If they can make the journey to Germany they can make a journey to larger cities and try to find jobs.

Many Syrian migrants that stayed are held in refugee camps in Syria and bordering countries and are under NGO and govt protection. Haven't seen any articles where these camps were attacked yet so it's likely safer than migration.

There is also the Assad regime which had majority support before the civil war and is undergoing recruitment due to deserters. If these people would rather fight than live in bad conditions they could fight for Assad or even for other militant groups before ISIs.

If these people will truly join ISIS if they don't get exactly what they want maybe that shows exactly why we shouldn't accept them.",2

"&gt; We still struggle against it in the western world and we have huge social pressures against thoughtless reproduction.

I couldn't agree more. I feel like most people think that Westerns somehow escaped the evolution and if just the whole world can be like West than humanity can finally live sustainable indefinitely. This couldn't be more wrong - the evolutionary pressures are pretty much unprecedented in the West. The fertility rate will rise again because the groups that for whatever reason are successful having a lot of kids are getting bigger and bigger. For example, in the last 100 years Mormons (or Amish) increased their population by a factor of 60 times while US total population increased only 3 times. Even inside groups there is evolution - for example, Heredi Jews have higher and higher share of the total Jewish population. That's not to say that only religious groups are the future - there are also secular families that for some reason (intentionally - tighter family bonds, inherent desire to have more kids, or unintentionally - sex without condoms just ""feels better"" (the reasons are on top of my head speculation - I'm sure there are lot of other reasons that we don't even notice)) have a lot of kids.",1

"I'll play a little bit of devil's advocate here. 

* In regard to the first story, the zoo was named the second worst by a group (IDA, In Defense of Animals) which (unless I'm reading it wrong) did not even visit the zoo.  They gave it the second worst rating for having a sole elephant.  The number one worst also had a sole elephant.  The zoo keeper said that this particular elephant had been with a group of other elephants, but ""did poorly"" with the herd. 

* To the second point, is swearing at a monkey really something to be concerned with?  Honestly?  If you watch the video, it's under his breath and he isn't even yelling at the animal.  If I walk up to my dog and call him ""little fucker"", is that animal abuse?  What is the issue, tone or verbiage? 

* This is a complete estimation on my part, but I'd assume that nearly every zoo in North America has been picketed by a group of people at one point or another.

* Over half of the zoos audited in this survey (that were accredited) received failing grades, and nearly 90% of unaccredited zoos failed.  I'm not saying they are excused for the reasons, but 1.) this was over 10 years ago now, and 2.) they were still not in the bottom 50% of zoos for the country. 

* Finally, he was accused of trying to obtain an elephant under false pretenses; by the same person who rated them second worst in the North America.   She said that she *believed* that he was trying to get the elephant for commercial use rather than breeding.  He argued that he already had an elephant for commercial use.  

Note: Had the lady in bullet 5 not block him from getting another elephant, then the elephant already at the zoo would have companionship.  The exact reason that they were voted second worst in bullet 1. 

I'm not saying hes right or wrong, but a little context is necessary I believe.  I've got no skin in this fight though, I don't even live in the  same country as this zoo.",13

"Yeah sorry I get what you're saying and I didn't mean it that harshly. It's a general attitude impression I have, and what I meant to say is simply that they're being counter-productive for their own communitys image and relations with muslims, specifically, around them. 

Iran is not the big bad they should be acting like such against. But I'm firmly against this group not having any responsibility. They claim to be an umbrella group and as such their behaviour is going to reflect on those they claim to represent, that is what I meant to say. 

I am somewhat biased against Judaism to be honest, it is by it's traditions an exclusive religion which teaches that they are chosen and no one else can truely become one unless born one. This is an issue where ever it is, but a core concept in Judaism and especially in what has become Zionism.

I have these biases against Muslims and Christians also, but what irritates me is the special treatment in that Iran does moderate stuff but should still be considered extremists and a terror state and somehow responsible for a lot of pain to Jews, and not allowed the benefit of the doubt. While Israel acts extremist and proto-fascist but should be considered civilized and somehow liberal and pro human rights. It's ridiculous when you compare the record. And somehow this extends to european Jews who denounce muslims in general for not denouncing ISIS loudly enough but at the same time rebuffs attemps to reconcile. And I have never read any line of text where a european Jewish association group denounce Israel for even the smallest of things.

And again, I firmly disagree that this umbrella group does not have any responsibility, if not in international diplomacy, but also local politics and attitudes. From their website:

&gt; Is CRIF truly representative of the Jewish community in France?

&gt; CRIF is representative of its member associations, that is to say the overwhelming majority of ""Jewish"" organizations with the national scope of France.

&gt;Does CRIF have an influence on French politics?

&gt;Yes, CRIF weighs on French politics by defending its vision of what should be the public policy against racism and anti-Semitism, offering its thoughts on the transmission of the memory of the Holocaust, or defending its idea of the Peace in the Middle East.
In summary, CRIF acts exactly like any other association concerned by the public interest.

"I'm asking specifically how we know that historical trauma is a contributing factor to relatively high rates of social dysfunction among indigenous Canadian - let alone to *what extent* it's a contributing factor. 

One of the most surprising findings of behavioural genetics has been the extent to which a child's home environment (or ""shared environment"") accounts for so little of the variation in personality and cognitive traits - typically below 5% of the total variation. Meanwhile, genetics typically accounts for around 40% of the variance in these traits in adulthood (for IQ it's around 75%). In other words, two adopted siblings raised in the same household will be almost no more similar to each other than two random unrelated individuals from the population. Given this I'm always skeptical of any given environmental explanation for behavioural patterns unless evidence is presented. 

So how else, besides ""just-so-stories"" do were know that historical trauma is the cause of these behaviours? What quantifiable data is there?",5

"Actually, the GDP of Utah went up by about 4%, and total recreational spending at the facilities went up about 2 bn after the Olympics. Tourism at those facilities almost doubled in the years after, and tax contributions almost doubled as well, specifically because of the Olympics.

So really, what your saying is, that no one goes to London because the Olympics were there, but almost twice the amount of people go to Utah because the Olympics were there. So that means that the London Olympics really have no discernible impact on London, whereas the SLC Olympics had a massive impact on SLC and Utah as a whole. 

I don't know how old you are, but prior to the the Olympics, Utah was always looked at as a poor place to go to. Especially for skiing, barely anyone would go there, and weren't considered anywhere near the top skiing destinations in the US, and the facilities were shit compared to most resorts. Now, Utah is considered a pretty freaking awesome place for sports tourism, with several new non-winter sports related industries specifically because the Olympics were there, bring about 150k jobs to the state, and is now considered one of the top skiing destinations in the US, if not the world.

&gt; Valuation of Aramco

'Trillions' based on current valuation of oil. If you are indeed correct about lower reserves (and there's no way to be certain) then Saudi will likely target just the downstream assets which too are valued in the hundreds of billions if not trillions. Other crown assets include land around the grand mosque in Mecca where a square meter of land goes for half a million and the government owns 4 million sqm.

&gt; Russia has industry besides oil. It doesn't export much except oil but produces a lot for internal consumption.

Russia is a net importer of almost every good. The current oil price drop has devalued the currency over 60% and resulted in price inflation of [over 15%](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/russia/inflation-cpi) in 2015 and the economy is in recession.

""UPDATE: A correction has been issued for this article regarding the claim that 160 children have died in Hamas tunnels. The figure is inaccurate. The figure represents the total number of deaths in the tunnels recorded by Hamas authorities as of 2012.""

Most of the tunnels were private enterprises but after Hamas came to power they instituted the Tunnel Affairs Commision ""In response to public concern at a rising toll of tunnel casualties, particularly of child workers, the TAC issued guidelines intended to ensure safe working conditions. Over time, it fenced off the site and stationed some three hundred black-clad internal-security personnel at entry points to spot-check the documentation of persons entering and leaving the zone.""

That control did not make many of the tunnel operators happy.
""Violations were punished. In 2009–10, for instance, the TAC closed at least five tunnels for smuggling tramadol and two for nonpayment of cigarette taxes. It destroyed an additional fifty nonoperational tunnels to prevent their use as safe houses or conduits to and from Egypt by “wanted” individuals. “We used to earn thousands smuggling small shipments of hand guns, grenades, bullets, and TNT,” said a tunnel operator who first entered the business at the end of the second intifada, “but it is no longer worth the risk to be prosecuted by Hamas.”

"&gt; Of course it is, an addiction is any action you continue doing in the face of negative consequences.

Negative consequences and risks are separate, though. If you can reduce the risk, then the negative consequences go with it. These are people sitting at computers, often in other countries in which they recognize the chance of themselves being discovered as being very low. Again, I have difficulty accepting that this is an issue with addiction. None of the literature I've read has implied a relationship.

Likewise, if what you said were true then every person who uses an illicit substance is addicted, regardless of actual signs of addiction. 

An addiction is a physical and psychological illness, not an action.

&gt;Addiction is a progressive disease, so while using can satiate the desire in the short term, as time goes on the reward centers of the brain just don't give the same jolt they used to, so people get more extreme.

That argument can extend to all forms of sexuality. I like aggressive porn, personally. I also like aggressive sex. I recognize that I have a strong rape fetish, likely influenced by needing to be so gentle in my previous relationship (vaginismus, I loved her and was willing to try to work through it with her). What you're saying implies that my consumption of aggressive material encourages an addiction for aggressive sex to the point in which I am unable to control my own desires. I'm still waiting for this to happen.

&gt;So allowing pedophiles to actively feed their addiction directly leads to more children being abused.

You still haven't made a clear connection to this end point. It can also be argued that the addiction is for child pornography, and not for abusing children. Consuming child pornography vs. sexually abusing a child is, from an experience perspective, going to be similar to viewing porn vs. having sex. There are many instances of men struggling to perform in the bedroom due to a porn addiction. This is because the two events are not at all the same thing.

Viewing child porn is to child sexual abuse is as viewing simulated rape porn is to rape. Or is as playing violent video games is to engaging in acts of violence.

Following that, there are no associations between any of these aside the manufactured ones. Plenty of people have tried to argue against porn laws and violent video games laws citing the same line of logic you're using. I'm sorry, but I don't see truth here.",4

Saudi Arabia didn't ask Russia or the US to cut production to shore up prices.

Many secular countries with sizable Muslim population have this issue. Political parties treat them as vote banks and create ghettos and silos where the cops can't even dare to enter.

"Something anecdotal here, not so much corruption, but certainly waste. I was deployed to Iraq in 2010, way up north in kurdistan, along the Tigris at a tiny little shithole called Wana village. We were just one platoon of 26 guys responsible for guarding Mosul's Northern front. It was pretty calm, as the kurds loved us. All that aside, my LT was given $10,000 a month and told that he had to spend it all, every month ""in order to support the local economy"". Do you have any idea how difficult it is to that? There were a lot of restrictions on how that money could be spent. For example, we used kerosene heaters in our tents when it was cold, which was about half of our deployment, but he couldn't buy kerosene with the money for some reason, and the army didn't supply it (we ended up trading JP8 under the table for it). Do you know how many falafels I was told to eat? A lot, a hell of a lot. He even bought a goat once, and let my medic shoot it then treat it just to get rid of the money. My medic shot a $10,000 goat that month. He paid $7500 for a wild dog once! It was incredibly wasteful, but we were popular with the local populace, that's for sure. Hopefully this will give an idea of where a lot of that money went. ""Hearts and Minds"" We were just one platoon. Nearly every Platoon, in every company, in every Battalion in that AO of Iraq was doing that at that time. Just imagine!  ",6

&gt; FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE and JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA - Since early December, public health officials around the world held their breath as the days quietly stacked up: first a week without a new Ebola case in West Africa, then another, then another.

&gt; &amp;quot;We don&amp;#039;t want to say &amp;#039;Ebola is gone,&amp;#039;&amp;quot; says Dr. Alex Gasasira, director for the World Health Organization office in Liberia, the last country to have an active Ebola case.

&gt; The sluggish response by both local governments and the international community to the first reports of confirmed Ebola cases in early 2014 allowed the disease to slip unnoticed over the border from rural Guinea into neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone, and from there on to overcrowded cities.

I'm proposing my own people should at all costs be kept safe from other worse people like the Syrians.  Most of them are stupid and shitty.

You're proposing that your own people should suffer to help people that provide no benefit from helping so you can feel good with your emotions.

It is so ironic that those within the industry refuse to take any responsibility.Eventually a gmo company will come along and do the marketing correct then they will do very well and others in the industry will follow. But naaa you will forever be blaming others while doing obvious actions that entrench and encourage that failure.

Though the birth rates are slightly different.  (Syria's birth rate is ~3.00, compared to Germany's 1.4.)  The momentum required to make the EU majority Muslim would be immense.  It would never happen, especially since the immigration policy of the EU has not done very well and will probably change next election cycle.  

Regardless, since Germany has a low birth rate, soon there will be a need for more laborers (at all levels of industry) as Germany's population ages.  Immigrants could fill these rolls.  These laborers would have been raised mostly in the West, and thus, would adapt more Western ways of thinking.  As I was taught, as groups become more educated, birth rates would decline, which is what would happen in say, 50 years.  

It isn't as drastic as you anticipate.  That would never happen.  

Germany has accepted approx.  1 million refugees **from around the globe.**  That is barely 1 eightieth of the population of Germany (which was 80.62 million).  As I said above, the amount of momentum to make the EU majority Muslim wold be immense.

"Well, if you reduced the world's population, say, by half, to 3.5 billions, that obviously wouldn't be the wealthier half. It'd be poorer half. They own something like 1% of world's wealth. 

The impact would be utterly minuscule.

I suspect that even if the population decreased ten times, to 700 million, those 700 millions would just use that to increase their own ecological footprint by 15..20% (which is the share of bottom 90% of world's population), and we'll be as fucked as we are with 7 billions. 

Reducing number of people consuming is completely pointless when the remaining people would just consume more. All we'd get is decrease number of people with 1-in-10000+ IQ (which are few even at 7 billions world population) to where technological progress would be slower, right at the point where progress is beginning to actually lead to decreasing consumption.

edit: I wonder how better-off 700 millions would do without the cheap labour. Solar panels would be much more expensive, and fossil fuels would be a bit cheaper.

edit2: it's kind of counter-intuitive in terms of millions. Picture there's a building with 10 people with a bunch of appliances, and they're playing some ""Big Brother"" style game where 1 of them gets to use the washer and dryer and the rest don't get to use it at all. The washer and dryer uses ~85% of electricity. It sounds like evicting 5 of them should cut electricity bill in half, but it won't, because someone's still using the washer and dryer.

It's all designed to keep the debate going.

It's your fault for electing a government that does this.""  

And here is the beauty:  in addition the the fact that this arguing drives people deeper into the ""movie"" and hides from people the fact that all of this exists to create the argument in the first place... it does something else too.  

Look at the mock statements above:  

""money is being shifted away from education""...  This strengthens the false assumption that the education people receive is actually valuable in the first place.  When in fact it is that same education that primes/preps people to believe the scripted ""movie"" in the first place, while simultaneously hiding useful information from them.  

""if you didn't interfere"", ""your fault for electing""... This strengthens the false assumption that the power ultimately resides with the people.  And the false assumption that elections/democracies are real.  The media controls a democracy because the media controls what exists.  Maybe someone down my street would be the best leader.  But I can't vote for them if I don't know they exist.  The media controls what exists.  And the media will only point the camera at people that are in on the whole thing.  

By the way this observation about the media controlling ""what exists"" is a very important one, and also kindergarten level thinking.  So one would expect the great thinkers (top academics at places like Harvard) to talk about it.  It is kindergarten level thinking after all, and they are Harvard professors.  Unfortunately the answer is:  they are in on it too.  (And this is the crux of the whole thing)

"The problem isn't in taking refugees, it's how many and what you do with them. 

I am a firm believer that western culture is something that should be protected and encouraged (at least in western countries!).

You're right that people will adapt, but ONLY given the right circumstances (to take it to the extreme, if you have a population of 3 million and take in 3 million refugees, your culture isn't necessarily going to survive, is it?).

The biggest, and hardest, part of this is preventing the creation of ""ghettos"" (even self selected ones).

"You think the anti-Israeli view of the conflict is tantamount to calling the earth flat, and yet you want me to believe that Israel is being reasonable about pursuing relations with Iran? *You just claimed that they're flat-earthers.*

Just listen to yourself

&gt; No, I'm saying that they started the war. As in, they literally invaded Israel, the day after it declared independence, without any prior attacks from Israel

Did this happen in a vaccum? Did Israel just declare independence on an *uninhabited island*? This is what I'm talking about when I say you arbitrarily place a line between the irrelevant past and the relevant past. Israel's declaration of independence is tantamount to a declaration of conquest, the Palestinians and their allies didn't ask for that, they *responded* to it, but you place an arbitrary boundary to make the response seem as though it came out of thin air.

&gt; The Arabs would've been better off if they accepted peace instead of starting a futile war after futile war

This justification is pure thuggery. ""You would have been better off if you just gave me what I asked for instead of forcing me to take it from you.""

But my viewpoint doesn't depend on arguing you into the ground, all I have to do is claim that Iran has a *reasonable* viewpoint when it comes to the legitimacy of the State of Israel. I can also agree that you have a *reasonable* viewpoint, insofar as Israel exists and can't be simply ""unexisted"" without more carnage. 

Two reasonable but opposing viewpoints, diplomatic relations have managed to bridge such gaps before.

But *your* argument is dependent on the narrative that there is only one reasonable viewpoint. You have to completely destroy the Iranian view, I only need to muddy the waters. That's why I'm on the middle ground.",1

It's really all up to you as an individual to eat it). As much as I like meat, I won't complain about getting food. Food is food is food, you know? People are starving in Africa and all that jazz.

Oddly enough I don't really believe in any of the spirituality of Islam anymore, although I can't bring myself to eat pork. It's too weird for me at this point. Apparently its a common thing and it is more about cultural upbringing than religious belief. A lot of my not-so-religious ex-Muslim and ex-Jewish friends feel the same way as me.

My advice is if you get stuck in that situation where your kosher food needs are not accommodated for, just eat the vegetarian option. It's healthier, less morally taxing, and everyone can eat it. I know a lot of Jewish people prefer their plates and utensils to never have had non-Kosher food on them, so just ask for plastic utensils and plates and all that. Generally places will accommodate for everyone by having generic surfaces where no meat is prepared. I mean I think you probably already know all this, but that's all the advice I've got on the matter. Hope it helps!",0

While many of these new wells in the US are now unprofitable, the cost of setting them up is now sunk, and the profit they get from operations at $30/b is better than ceasing operations altogether. Basically the investors are still losing money, but they are losing *less* money than they would if they stopped pumping altogether.

Some of the firm's won't be able to make debt payments and will be sold off. The wells will continue to operate even if the initial drilling company goes bust and the assets are sold.

US oil is not about to disappear at this point and new wells will be built if the price starts to increase (which creates a negative incentive to allow the price to increase for producers that can produce more cheaply).

In the long term there is also price pressure from renewables that was never a legitimate threat in the past, but becomes one as oil approaches $60/b.

It will be interesting to see how this plays out, but really it looks to me as though Saudi Arabia is being totally up front when they say they want to protect market share.

" I see where you're coming from, but it's exactly the of type of oversimplification that Trump spreads that the left uses to create the false dichotomies used to vilify those who opposes them. For example, if you are for gay marriage, the  you love everything good in the world, but if you're against gay marriage, then you hate the gays. If you're for abortion you love women, if you're against abortion, then you hate women. It's those views that are oversimplified into false dichotomies that breed a hatred and refusal to hear the rationalization for anyone's opinion but the one people have already chosen with their emotions. This is particularly excruciating for the right, because we have good points, but the moment people on the left realize we don't share their opinions they block us, they start name calling, they start shouting over us - they  refuse to engage in discussion with us because they've already decided that we believe what we believe because we're evil and that they're the epitome of all that is good and moral, which we know to be false. That's why I say we need to articulate principle rather than oversimplify things into emotions or good and bad. When we do that we need to do it with incredible aggression and also as if we're teaching a lesson to children.

Nope.  You just don't get it, do you?  **1**) Obama won the election, in large part, because of how unpopular and, on the face of it, unsuccessful, Bush's policies were.  In all fairness, Bush's foreign policy in particular was probably just unpopular enough that it basically cost Hillary Clinton the nomination; and so,therefore, the Presidency as well.  So, taken purely from a stand-point of elective politics, he couldn't have pulled out soon enough!  **2**) This is completely intentional, as well.  Because, just as he was elected by a totally different constituency than the one that supported Bush, so too were his foreign policies about 180 degrees counter the kind of (mostly) unilateral and protracted type of ground commitment we saw from the previous administration.

I have seen estimates as high as 3 million for the refugees from those wars. look for the UNHCR reports for that war on the bottom of the wikipedia page. It's important to notice that the people from the baltics are closer culturally to the German people then many of the refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. Also many of the refugees were displaced internally, they did not all come to western Europe.

"This here. I do not think people outside of the EU, or even the people not living in the border areas of Schengen-countries realize how much commuting is going on between the countries. 

Example would be the Austrian cities Kufstein und Salzburg, were the fastest way to commute between these two would be to drive on the German side of the Border. Even most trains take that route.

So if all borders would be checked you need to put up with either two border checks for just a 1-direction drive (but you get the fast speed of the Autobahn) or you have to drive on small as mountain road that drags on for ever.

And this is not the only example in almost every border are in the Alps you have this wired highway systems (Due to the fact that you cant just put an highway where ever you want in the Alps) were you just want to go from one country to another but to do that you need to first drive a short distance on the highways of a third country.

And remember that almost all people in the border area commute over the borders on daily basis, because gas is cheaper, jobs pay better, cost of living is lower, etc, etc.

I do not think a lot of people living in the EU realize just how much Schengen has improved the overall quality of living in the border areas. ",27

I thought that you just said that the poor are giving to the rich? How are the rich taking from the poor?

&gt;do you think it's fair that when a company get a raise in earning, all the raise is only goes to the owner, not to the labor?

If a company gets a raise in earnings, they usually give bonuses/raises to the person(s) responsible for these raises in profits to incentivize more innovation. If an employee creates a ton of value, it is their responsibility to negotiate a higher salary. Granted, unless the labor is exploitative. I would agree that the minimum wage should be high enough to provide a reasonable standard of living to workers. In my opinion, an economy shouldnt offer jobs that dont pay a reasonable standard of living to employees.",1

The announcement that a Commission had been appointed by His Majesty's Government, with the approval of the League of Nations, to study, define, and determine the rights and claims of Moslems and Jews connected with the Wailing Wall, and the arrival of the Commission in Palestine in June, also contributed to ease the dangerous tension which followed **the outbreak of 1929**. (See paragraph 5 on page 5 of the Report for 1929.)""


&gt; ""10.	Eighteen of the persons sentenced to death in 1929 and 1930 applied for special leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but in no instance was this leave granted by the Privy Council.

&gt;&gt; After very careful consideration of the capital cases in which sentence of death was confirmed by the Court of Appeal (namely 7 in 1929 and 20 in 1930), the High Commissioner decided, in exercise of the prerogative of mercy vested in him by Article 16 of the Palestine Order in Council, 1922, to commute the sentences of death, in all but three cases, to penal servitude for life or a term of years. The three Arabs whose sentences of death were carried out had committed **particularly brutal murders at Safad and Hebron**.""

"&gt; Not quite. The media makes it look like most are educated, but those are only the ones we single out and name. 

Unfortunately, the worst terrorists tend to be those who are educated.  For an example, read [this discussion](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/akhwaja/media/madrassa/NYTimes.htm) which states:

&gt; We examined the educational backgrounds of 75 terrorists behind some of the most significant recent terrorist attacks against Westerners. We found that a majority of them are college-educated, often in technical subjects like engineering. In the four attacks for which the most complete information about the perpetrators' educational levels is available - the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, the attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the 9/11 attacks, and the Bali bombings in 2002 - 53 percent of the terrorists had either attended college or had received a college degree. As a point of reference, only 52 percent of Americans have been to college. The terrorists in our study thus appear, on average, to be as well educated as many Americans.

That isn't the same as saying that all the Syrian terrorists in ISIS are college educated or anything like that, but it's clear that education does not inoculate someone against becoming an extremist.  If you want an American example of a highly educated person with extreme views (but is not violent) I'd suggest Ben Carson.  If anything, education could make people with extreme views even worse, because then they're more confident that they are always correct.

That being said, the problem here isn't education or a lack of education.  It's an incomplete education.  Overall, we can solve extremism in part by removing ignorance about many things to help people become more well-rounded.  However, as college has basically become tied to gaining employment versus becoming a more intelligent person in general, we're simply not seeing these people being properly educated in things like history, logic, science, etc.",11

Canada doesn't use enough steel by itself to justify such a measure, you'd be locking yourself out of the international marketplace. You'd also be taxing every Canadian company that relies on steel.

"Because getting oil to turn into gas takes extreme amount of engineering, skilled labour, chemistry, and a massive multibillion dollar refinery.  Oil is not gas in any way... Refining oil is a very interesting, amazing, complicated, and expensive process. Modern day Chemistry is all based off of oil chemistry, so is modern day manufacturing.  So if you want to get away from oil, we have to fundamentally change the way we manufacture products, and produce chemicals.  From plastics, to textiles, to feed stocks that run glass furnaces and ceramic factories, to medicine, to agriculture.  Everything Is based off of oil/ natural gas chemistry. Because thats the way we decided to become an industrial nation.  We can build all the damn windmills we want.. It won't change the fact that the entire worlds manufacturing base, and Chemical synthesizing base uses oil and oil feedstocks.

Not  only that Refineries have to constantly shut down due to federal regulations, and Engineering ethics set by API, ASME, ANSI, and other boards.  Because they operate at very high temps, and very high pressures.  Because its a massive chemistry set, that is having millions of chemical reactions at once... with chemicals running through it that are acidic, caustic, and dangerous.  So the refineries are always shutting down based off of specific guidelines that adhere to specific units, processes, Chemicals used, engineering codes, and process controls standards.

This is to 

1. protect the local community from a catastrophic failure

2. To protect the Global economy. ( Because a catastrophic failure That causes a refinery to shutdown for for unplanned work, or even shut down permanently can reek havoc on global markets.) 

3. to protect the Assets and process units of the Owner of said refinery.

So when a shutdown happens, the refinery is not at full capacity or at 0 capacity depending on what unit gets shut down for inspections and repair.

Your ""love and humanity"" are very selective and I don't see that your philosophy, put into action, has made the world a better place.

And girls get to grow up knowing that the police of their society are more concerned about silencing their abuse than punishing it, and that the rights of Africans to feign refugee status is more important than their right to feel safe in their own hometowns. Is the world a better place as a result? I'm not so sure.

"&gt; Yes. There's many autistic people who are tired of being told they need to be ""cured"" as if they were an illness. Tired of being told their minds are illness.

Yes but recognising you have a disorder is not the same as not wanting to be cured or treated like you are an illness.

I believe both things.

&gt;No, you're just making up stuff about people-- name calling.

1) Making stuff up isn't name calling.
2) It's not made up.  I know quite a lot of autistic people, meltdowns and sensory issues are common.

&gt;The ""medical standard"" according to the state used to be that gays were mentally ill. That's not evidence that any behavior, misbehavior, or feeling is an illness.

True and that is a good reason to be skeptical, I just meant that it wasn't just my personal opinion.

&gt;Again, I said I will not assume. ie, I will not assume because assuming is irrational.

It's not just not assuming though, given they are assessed under the same diagnostic criteria, what leads you to be skeptical they are related?

Also, who are these low functioning people you are thinking of?  Because it seems people who are almost non-verbal or entirely non-verbal but can type fine don't seem to count to you, but that makes up the majority of the most low functioning individuals.  Though some can't even communicate via typing.

How small is the minority who you feel shouldn't be classed as autistic?
And why is it you feel they shouldn't be classed as autistic?  If they have the same difficulties shouldn't they be?  Are there low functioning people diagnosed with autism who do not just have higher severity of the same issues as high functioning individuals?

Is it not possible for someone to have both intellectual disability AND be autistic?  It's not like all people with intellectual disability are diagnosed with autism, and it's not like they are diagnosed because they are intellectually disabled, they are diagnosed for fitting the same criteria as the high functioning people.

Also what about the entire spectrum?  Mid functioning people?  Where is the line drawn, at what point do you go ""No this is just retardation not autism""?

&gt;Wrong. Autism is not ever scientifically ""diagnosed"" because it is not an illness.

Diagnose - ""identify the nature of (an illness or other problem) by examination of the symptoms.""
Whether you agree that autism should be diagnosed or not, the fact is it is.

Or if you don't like that, come up with a new word for whatever it is doctors do when they assess someone and then give them a ""something"" that goes on their medical record.

""Accuse"" seems to be your choice of word even though I never felt accused being told I am autistic.

But the fact is, low functioning and high functioning autistic people are assessed under the same criteria, so they have to show issues on the same tests, they have to have difficulties in the same areas, in order to be diagnosed.

&gt;It's always dehumanizing to pretend another person's differences are a permanent brain malfunction, even if the person is indoctrination, or is not smart enough to understand that.

Apparently the definition of dehumanize is ""Deprive of positive human qualities."", being told  you have a permanent brain disorder does not deprive you of any positive human qualities.

What definition of dehumanizing are you using?

&gt;Wrong. The fact that psychiatrists accused people of autism is not an accurate count of anything. Psychiatrists get paid more to ""diagnose"" their victims.

Then under what criteria do you classify people as autistic?

Anyway that just means that intellectual disability is even more common than autism, so your comment about rareness compared to autism doesn't really make sense.",1

- You must accept employement if offered and must work to keep it.  
- You must attent a Uitzendbureau (A institute where employers can easily search people for small jobs)  
- You must be willing to travel a maximum of 3 hours a day if this is necessary to find employment. (In context: In 3 hours you can practically cross our nation by car).  
- You must be willing to move to a new location if you can not find employment within a maximum of 3 hours travel per day.  
- You must attempt everything to maintain acquired skills and knowledge  
- You must cooperate with support given by you municipal government  
- You must ensure that your clothing, personal hygiene, or attitude/behaviour do not prevent you from finding employement

It has to keep the road smooth for cars while allowing the bridge deck and angled support cables to expand and contract with temperature changes.

They engineer bridges so that where the bridge deck ends meet the road at grade they have a joint called an expansion joint. This looks like interlocking combs and they allow the bridge deck to expand and contract laterally while keeping the road smooth. The bridge ends rest on a ""bearing"" which provides vertical support while allowing lateral motion - like a wheel or ball bearing.

If the bridge is just a rigid welded truss then that is all you need.
Suspension bridges have a flexible deck. This bridge is held up by the big angled cables connected to the main support. The deck is flexible enough that it can change its curvature with load from cars or temperature changes. If the ends were free then expansion and contraction in the angled cables would lift and lower the ends of the bridge deck. Cold days would lift the ends as the cables shrank, hot days would lower the ends (ignoring the deck also expanding/contracting.)

To solve that problem, they engineer the ends to always ""want"" to be ""up"" from road at grade at each end. Then they use beefy bolts to pull the ends down onto the bearing and expansion joint. The result is that heat and cold mean the expansion joint stays level but cold just makes the angled cables be a bit tighter and pull a bit harder on the bolts and hot makes them a bit looser and pull less hard. Forces change but the transition stays level.
If the bolts fail then the end pops up. The cement barriers piled up push the bridge down onto the bearing and keep it level. Their weight provides the downward force left missing by the failed bolts",1

"It is difficult to say how much Taiwanese will put up a fight if China invades.  My guess is Taiwan will have a mass exodus.  The majority of Taiwanese will flee or try to flee the island instead of fighting a losing cause.

It really depends on the US.  If the US honors the [Mutual Defense Treaty between the US and Taiwan](http://www.taiwandocuments.org/mutual01.htm), (one that Ukraine did not have with the US or EU,) then China will most certainly lose the invasion - because the US also has mutual defense treaties with Japan, South Korea, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.  If the US decides to defend Taiwan, Japan will most certainly join the US.  I suspect the Philippines and some Southeast Asian countries will join the US and Japan as well, thinking that when China is defeated and surrenders, China will have to make concessions in the South China Sea disputes.  The UK, France and Germany - the staunch allies of the US - will very likely join the US.  On the global stage, the US, the UK, Germany and France usually act as a single unit against their common opponents, which include China.

Which means if the US get into a fight with China, many of US allies will be dragged into the battle.  On the other hand, China has many enemies but no real ally, certainly not one who will be willing to fight the US on China's behalf.  The odd of China willing a fight with the US *and* Taiwan *and* Japan *and* the Philippines *and* the UK *and* France *and* Germany *and* potentially more US allies, is.... *nil*.  Chinese love to fantasize about how they could defeat the US in a war over Taiwan, but they always forget to factor in the certainty: US allies.

While I don't think you are wrong, you are still mentally approaching it the exact way that he detailed. We tend to be almost completely unable to fathom what a lifetime of reinforcement, especially during formative years, combined with social groupthink and behavior that validates and encourages a behavior, is able to do to an otherwise average person.

There are monsters living right now, look at ISIS. There are individuals brutally murdering and raping their way across entire countries but those individuals were once children kicking balls around in a field. There were Nazis who did monstrous things because they were ordered to, not because they thought it was the right thing to do. Look at the Milgram experiments. Statistically, and it is a leap of course to apply to a larger sample, but many of us will kill a stranger because someone told us to, without even questioning it, if the person asking is perceived as an expert or in charge. 

We can't make the jump to validate those sorts of behavior, which is a really, really good thing. That's the product of developing as individuals within a modern, educated society. But we also can't seem to realize that you can be fundamentally at odds with what to the rest of the educated, modern world seems like common sense to such a degree that it takes an enormous amount of work just to reach out to you, let alone fix the problems if they are even fixable. 

It's the human mind, I mean look at how many of us still worship bronze age ""deities"" in an age where we know how particles gain mass and very likely soon going to find microbial life on another nearby planet. It's not like those people are abandoning their ancient belief systems in droves because information is plentiful that renders it irrelevant, no, they cling to it even harder because it's what they know, and even worse it's what they believe. Belief allows for the perpetuation of anything we want, and makes evidence completely meaningless. Many of these refugees believe that things are the way they are because of divine mandate, and there is nothing that supersedes a divine mandate. Humans have used that notion to control other humans for all of recorded history up to and including today. 

That's the same sort of mental roadblocks in place in these refugees. Regardless of how simple we think it is to change, it isn't, and the problems will continue very likely until their entire culture shifts as they integrate over a few generations. The lack of integration is the most troubling aspect of these refugees, and really most migrants in general coming from areas that were left behind in terms of social progress.

At the end of the day, he is right. There are too many at once, they aren't adopting and no one is making them adopt customs, and even if they did it isn't something that fades in a single generation. There is no fix unfortunately.",12

Negativity in positioning is reactionary. If a position is constituted by opposing other values, what are its own values? This is the issue at hand with ISIS *as opposed to* Islam. It is not the case for any or all instances of textual interpretation (or even fanaticism). The case of ISIS demonstrates the positioning of an ideology predicated less on religious substance (while at the same time utilizing scripture to accomplish its efforts) than outright violence and insecurity. I would argue that ISIS could only exist in the region because of an insecurity exposed by opposition to infringing western modes. This insecurity is the motivation to violence, not religion. I disagree with you because I do not believe that merely re-assigning the values of a text proliferates violence. In my view, the spread of sectarian violence in the case of ISIS requires a preexisting need. Namely: security.",-1

You forgot to count the basic fact that its also responsible for imprisoning *HUNDREDS of MILLIONS* of women for the entire century. That makes it the champion prisoner system.

How many people have died because of non wartime islamic judgements like heresy and so on or daring to contradict some imam ?

That must be a very big number, surely in the millions. How many have the Saudis killed in the name of religion ? Now keep counting for all the religious countries under Islam and the number is going to be easily tens maybe hundreds of millions.

How many underage girls have been raped because of the Koran this century ? Hundreds of millions.

Next time try and be a bit more honest in your assessment, just living under a religious system causes a lot of pain and death. Try counting them. Try counting how many died because of xianity when it had power for 1850 years. That figure must be BILLIONS. Same goes for the 1400 years of ISLAMIC power.

"Are you kidding me? 

A Palestinian starts shooting at random Israeli Jews in an Israeli central bus station, because he wants to kill as many Israeli Jews as possible. In the panic that ensues, a security guard shoots an innocent refugee/migrant worker from Africa, thinking he was the assailant. We don't know why, but you can't blame this on ""racial profiling"", because Palestinians are overwhelmingly white. The crowd surrounds him, thinking he was the person who was trying to murder them a few moments ago, and starts beating up the dying man. The paramedics disperse the crowd, and the man later dies of the gunshot wound, rather than because of anything to do with the mob.

meteorblade's summary of the event: ""At a bus station in the south of Israel, a mob of Jews beat a black Jew to death because they thought he was Palestinian.""

Was the mob right? Of course not. Were they racist? Very possible (although it's a bit hard for me to judge people who were literally shot at, because of their ethnicity, just moments ago). But is me exposing meteorblade's lies a ""rationalization"". No, sorry, it's absolutely not.

"Feminists believe that both genders are equal, at least mentally and should be treated as such or if they are not equal in some way that we should strive to understand if it is something societal that can change. Biological differences don't apply to all women or men, even if there is a disparity in the averages. Not all people should be treated as though they were just like everyone else in their defined group.

Men should have the choice to raise the children, women the choice to be a business leader. Just because society pushes women into caretaker roles and men into dangerous jobs doesn't mean that they should do that. Society should make changes to minimize these differences that are resultant from a men are leaders women are submissive. 

Misandrists and misogynists are not people that believe in equality. People on reddit make this seem very broad. And a lot of people are bitter about the discrimination that they have faced and it's easy to blame a large group of people for that. Yeah, patriarchy exists, but men aren't responsible for that any more than the women that let it continue. Women working professionally has led to more competition for jobs and have made it more difficult for men to get them than their grandfathers had. 

But getting equality in that field isn't the fault of women. It's the weakness of the system we had in the first place. Now, with both genders, we are able to have the best and brightest in the world, not just of one specific group. It's better for humanity.

"That's really unfortunate. I don't blame you - it's fucked up that the education systems of most non-African countries do not cover Africa in any detail at all. 

It's a landlocked country in West Africa. The area was under the control of various Mossi kingdoms for most of the 2nd Millennium CE, maintaining independence from the large Mali and Songhai empires. They even conquered all the way up to Timbuktu, but after the ascension of Askia Muhammad I to the Songhai throne in 1493 (perhaps best known on Reddit if you play Civ V!), he declared a holy war on the Mossi kingdoms as they practiced polytheism. He defeated them, incorporating them into the Songhai empire, but did not succeed in converting them to Islam (though the majority of modern Burkinabe people are now Muslim). The Mossi kingdoms were able to regain their independence after the defeat of the Songhai empire by the Saadi Moroccan empire in 1591. 

The Mossi kingdoms were conquered by the French empire in 1896, and the French colony of Upper Volta was established. The colony achieved independence in 1960. The next major event in Burkinabe history was the leftist overthrow of the government in 1983 by Thomas Sankara (occasionally referred to as the 'African Che'). He was a charismatic and popular leader, who changed the name of the country to Burkina Faso ('Burkina' being Mossi for 'upright men' and 'Faso' being Dioula, another language commonly spoken in Burkina Faso, for 'fatherland'). 

Sankara ended up being assassinated by his own friend and ally Blaise Compaoré in 1987, and he seized power, and was president of the country until his overthrow in 2014 in a revolution. He was succeeded eventually by Michel Kafando, who is the current Burkinabe president. 

Burkina Faso is probably most well-known in the continent for FESPACO, the Pan-African Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou, which is the largest film festival in the continent and whose prizes are highly regarded.

Trudeau din't single out the Jews because they weren't the only victims, not by far. Not even the majority of Nazi victims were Jewish; They were just the biggest single group. If Trudeau had listed all the kinds of people the Nazis killed, he'd be there all day (and would have listed some that would've made a lot of Israelis uncomfortable).

Canada is a semi-neutral country. We are currently trying to find a peaceful center between Christian xenophobia and Muslim extremism. Trudeau made the speech that would come closest to not pissing anyone off over nothing. Frankly, if it irks YET ANOTHER Jewish media company, I, a Canadian, could not possibly care less. 

In fact, I strongly support Trudeau's decision to not pander to the descendants of one particular group of victims. It's time we accepted that EVERYONE caught up in the Holocaust had it bad, not just the only ones who managed to leverage it into their own independent-but-protected nation (a consideration that certainly wasn't extended to, say, communists, Slavs, gays...).

Its super hard to find a decent party to vote for in germany.

The leftists are too left and ignoring every sign of danger, the right wing is retardet, filled with extremists and people at the very bottom that need someone to look down on and the mainstream partys never keep their promises and are essentially the same (+ a coalation every time) , even though one is supposed to be half left and one half right.

Its definetely the correct choice to vote for the party that is the least bad, but man is it hard to find someone decent to vote for. Added to this the actual elections are not until 2017.

But what are we supposed to do? On the streets we only have 2 sides of demonstrations: far left and far right. Far left is doing counter demonstrations against the right while the right have politicans shouting stuff as if we were in 1940 and their faction leader is shouting stuff like ""Deutschland ist schön...DEUTSCH!"" and is ""afraid"" that the white german race might mix with the black.

Canada is a quite wealthy country, and it's a bit shameful that their governments policy is to tacitly rely on the U.S. infrastructure for transportation.  I absolutely maintain my wifi analogy, because it's quite apt.  If Canada isn't paying, they are truly a free-rider in a literal and metaphorical sense of the phrase.

If Canada wants to rely on something that Americans have spent trillions to build and maintain, they should have to pay (And more so than American citizens) for the privilege of using it.

I am 4th gen immigrant, not very close to the OGs who came over but enough where my family still talks to relatives in the other countries, have places to visit, and embrace the culture here. America was founded on the back of immigration, i think American culture differs so widely that its almost impossible to pin it down.  Kentucky vs NYC, Hollywood vs Compton.  Neighborhood to neighborhood even. A lot of Americans would have two definers, one within America and one without.  ""I'm american"" when they're outside, ""I'm german spanish and irish, my family is from county Derry and the Galicia area.""  

I feel like is a common way of defining heritage.  I think people getting hung up on their own identity are probably trying to rectify their upbringing and familys probable embrace of their abroad heritage with someone saying ""you;re american"" it can be both. And I think a lot of people outside the country don;t understand that, because they've spent their entire lives being ""just X nationality""

I would also say American culture isn't so much defined as it is fluid.  And pop culture of the time is the culture of every culture everywhere.

"Going to piggyback on here, and bring some points up. Sexual assault and sexism is rampant in many Arabic and North African countries, but is also extremely common in Western countries.

When reading the numbers of assaults reported (keep in mind most assaults are not reported) above, I was surprise. Not, however, surprised in the way one might think; these numbers don't seem especially high. Rather, my immediate impression is that these articles are biased in their anti-immigrant/refugee, and racist leanings. Sexual assault and rape are EXTREMELY common, and the fact that these assaults are getting media attention is good, but unfortunately being presented in the entirely wrong way.

From Canadian statistics:

- Of every 100 incidents of sexual assault, only 6 are reported to the police

**- 1 in 4 North American women will be sexually assaulted during their lifetime**

- sexual assault is far more common than most would suspect
- relatively few incidents of sexual assault are reported to the police
- young and otherwise vulnerable women are most likely to be sexually abused

**- most sexual assaults are committed by someone close to the victim, not a stranger**

[More myths vs. facts](http://www.sexassault.ca/mythsfacts.htm)

Finally, in the United States **someone is assaulted an average of every 107 seconds** -- that's approximately 293 000 people per year. [Source](https://rainn.org/statistics)

Yes, lets talk about the frequency of sexual assault. Yes, lets talk about the cultural issues that allow this to continue to be such a widespread problem. Yes, lets investigate these problems worldwide. Yes, lets offer support to the thousands and thousands of victims across the globe. 

But, lets not pretend this is an issue caused by refugees and migrants. Lets not let this fuel the rampant racism that is already making it impossible for those families fleeing war to find safety. And most importantly, lets not pretend this is solely a problem in Arabic and North African countries.

If anything, you're just someone who can't tell what's propaganda and what isn't.  And that's fine, you don't have to be thin-skinned about it, just read/learn/move on.

You're all over the place in this sub, earlier you said that there was around a 2,000 year history of Uighurs in Xinjiang and then in another comment it was since 900 AD.  Which points to what went unaddressed earlier:  What ""history"" are you subscribing to?

It seems like your motive is to discredit Uighur claims and history in Xinjiang, reaffirming the unity of China to include both Xinjiang and Tibet.  Hence your other claim about the CIA orchestrating an independence movement in Tibet and the Soviets pushing for Xinjiang's independence movement.  I don't really give a shit about either of those fights, I'm mostly just correcting the weird history of Xinjiang you're presenting.

There is a pretty compelling argument that, as you said earlier, the vicious cycle between the Uighurs in Xinjiang and the Chinese gov't is only going to continue.  And there's really no reason to believe that the Chinese government will back down, nor will the radical Islamic extremists.  China finds a sympathetic Sheik, the next thing you know he's killed on the steps of the mosque.  Pretty much everyone in the world was horrified by that group of people attacking the subway station as well.  And there have been several other incidents you can point to, including mass public executions in Xinjiang as a show of force.  It's a shit-show, for sure.  One that cannot be laid at the feet of Stalin, as you're trying to do.",1

&gt; NEW DELHI: The Union home ministry&amp;#039;s disaster management experts have warned of a bigger catastrophe, earthquakes with a magnitude of 8.2 or greater on the Richter scale which may hit the already ruptured Himalayan region.

&gt; The North-East and other hill states fall under severe seismic Zone V. Though some Indian scientists have reservations, but international experts, prominently Roger Bilham, the seismologist of University of Colorado and an authority on the subject, are of the opinion that &amp;quot;The current conditions might trigger at least four earthquakes greater than 8.0 in magnitude. And if they delay, the strain accumulated during the centuries provokes more catastrophic mega earthquakes.""

&gt; The UN office for disaster risk reduction, which considers India a valuable partner and had even acknowledged the leadership of minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju and made him a disaster risk reduction champion for Asia two months ago, has emphasised India&amp;#039;s need for compliance with building codes and the necessity for an &amp;quot;Enhanced preparedness for effective response to earthquakes.&amp;quot;Read this story in Telugu.

&gt; BEIRUT Iran&amp;#039;s release from sanctions testifies to its new relationship with the United States as it moves from pariah state to regional power, a status that could come at the cost of Saudi Arabia, Washington&amp;#039;s chief Arab ally.

&gt; &amp;quot;There is a new relationship based on a new understanding of Iran&amp;#039;s pivotal role in the region - that Iran is here to stay,&amp;quot; he said.

&gt; &amp;quot;We will not allow Iran to destabilize our region. We will not allow Iran to do harm to our citizens or those of our allies and so we will react. But it is a reaction in response to Iranian aggression,&amp;quot; Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told Reuters this month.

As far as slaughters in Syria and Middle East are concerned - sad truth is Islamic regions, especially Middle East have always been that way.

When Sunni groups are killing Shia (another brand of Muslims) en masse, who do you blame for that?

US and other western countries should have never intervened in the Middle East and just let that region play out itself over the next hundreds of years and it might have led to some kind of Islamic reform - not likely - but a small chance nonetheless.

Believe it or not - Islam either needs a major reform, or it needs to be banned completely if you want to prevent those slaughters in Syria or Middle East.

"""6. We wage war against the corrupt parliamentary administration whereby men are appointed to posts by favor of the party without regard to character and fitness.

7. We demand that the State shall above all undertake to ensure that every citizen shall have the possibility of living decently and earning a livelihood. 


9. All citizens must possess equal rights and duties.

10. The first duty of every citizen must be to work mentally or physically. No individual shall do any work that offends against the interest of the community to the benefit of all.

Therefore we demand:

11. That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished.

12. Since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure, all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people. We therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits.

13. We demand the nationalization of all trusts.

14. We demand profit-sharing in large industries.

15. We demand a generous increase in old-age pensions.

16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a sound middle-class, the immediate communalization of large stores which will be rented cheaply to small tradespeople, and the strongest consideration must be given to ensure that small traders shall deliver the supplies needed by the State, the provinces and municipalities.

17. We demand an agrarian reform in accordance with our national requirements, and the enactment of a law to expropriate the owners without compensation of any land needed for the common purpose. The abolition of ground rents, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.

18. We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers, etc., are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race.

19. We demand that Roman law, which serves a materialist ordering of the world, be replaced by common law.

20. In order to make it possible for every capable and industrious citizen to obtain higher education, and thus the opportunity to reach into positions of leadership, the State must assume the responsibility of organizing thoroughly the entire cultural system of the people. The curricula of all educational establishments shall be adapted to practical life. The conception of the State Idea (science of citizenship) must be taught in the schools from the very beginning. We demand that specially talented children of poor parents, whatever their station or occupation, be educated at the expense of the State.

21. The State has the duty to help raise the standard of national health by providing maternity welfare centers, by prohibiting juvenile labor, by increasing physical fitness through the introduction of compulsory games and gymnastics, and by the greatest possible encouragement of associations concerned with the physical education of the young.

22. We demand the abolition of the regular army and the creation of a national (folk) army.

23. We demand that there be a legal campaign against those who propagate deliberate political lies and disseminate them through the press. 

Newspapers transgressing against the common welfare shall be suppressed. We demand legal action against those tendencies in art and literature that have a disruptive influence upon the life of our folk, and that any organizations that offend against the foregoing demands shall be dissolved.

24. We demand freedom for all religious faiths in the state, insofar as they do not endanger its existence or offend the moral and ethical sense of the state.

The party as such represents the point of view of a positive moral code without binding itself to any one particular confession. It fights against the materialist spirit within and without, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our folk can only come about from within on the pinciple:

COMMON GOOD BEFORE INDIVIDUAL GOOD

25. In order to carry out this program we demand: the creation of a strong central authority in the State, the unconditional authority by the political central parliament of the whole State and all its organizations.

The formation of professional committees and of committees representing the several estates of the realm, to ensure that the laws promulgated by the central authority shall be carried out by the federal states.

The leaders of the party undertake to promote the execution of the foregoing points at all costs, if necessary at the sacrifice of their own lives.

The refugees we are taking in went through the long and properly legal process from camps in Jordan, Lebanon, etc. and we decided to not accept single men to attempt to target the legitimate threat that can be posed by individuals coming from this war torn region. As a country we are rich enough relatively speaking to support these people who truly have lost almost everything. To compare the situation in Europe currently, with the processes underway in the US and Canada to take refugees is a disservice to the system and leads to miss-informed people and more ignorance and anger. While I agree with our system in Canada, the mass, unregulated acceptance of essentially any one of Middle Eastern/North African region once they throw away their passports or identification can not lead to good things in the long run without a plan to deal with the problems posed. The media needs to distinguish between the refugees coming to western countries legally and those who are joining the refugees through the essentially unregulated system in an attempt to gain a better life, benefits, etc. This is vastly important to understanding the situation and creating a plan to stem the problem.",2

from this article:
------------------------------------
Among the increasing number of victims who came forward to tell their accounts of what had happened to them, Michelle, 18, told the station NTV how she had suddenly been surrounded by 20 to 30 men.

“We were a group of 11 people. We held hands – simply desperate that none of us would get torn away – the men were in front of us. They groped us and we tried our best to get away as soon as possible.” Only afterwards did some of them realise their mobile phones had been stolen.

They watched as the men set off fireworks in front of the cathedral, **unhindered by the police**. Their attempts to re-enter the station to get trains home were blocked by police, who she said prevented anyone from entering “because of the huge crowds”.
--------------------

This is not the only report along these lines.  The police *were* aware.  They did nothing.  They then covered up that anything happened at all.

You really missed this??  Do you have blinders for anything that doesn't fit your previously established opinion of what the ""facts"" are?  You are part of the problem, as you're convincing people that the left is utterly unwilling to even acknowledge the truth.

Just look at how muslims in the uk banded together and took over schools by voting in organized groups at the local level to make shit how their faith says it should be.

Thats an example of what they will do as when they can obtain a majority, they band together in small communities so they become the majority in an area then do this, if they ever become a sizable voting bloc then countries are rapidly going to go to shit.

"Thanks for clearing up some misconceptions I had. I had mistakenly made it seem that militarism was unique to Germany in the early 1900's, which I think is an incorrect representation of what I was trying to communicate. Indeed, you are perfectly correct that militarism was just as widespread in the world stage as the German Empire, there is no contest there. I poorly communicated that the militarism in Germany, due to a combination of other social factors (such as ""Obrigkeitshörigkeit"" you told me about, and the wider trend of nationalism, class tied to service), contributed to a society that was capable of rapidly mobilizing an armed force at a massive scale which made bog standard militarism seem peace loving in comparison. I was wrong to portray it as merely being ""Militarism"" and I thank you for clarifying my errors in statement. 

I also did not mean to imply that the society/culture was rooted in arms/power/martial ideas, merely that through a combination of factors - from an observers point of view - the nation *seemed* incredibly militaristic compared to it's contemporaries. I was again mistaken on that point and spoke in error. This was exacerbated by towards the end of the war Germany becoming a quasi/de-facto dictatorship towards the end of the war under Ludendorff. 

As I said, every nation lost a large amount of it's militarism after the Great war. A combination of factors (The shame of defeat, the shame inflicted - such as black crosses for German soldiers, and sheer strain put on German society by the war effort in terms of population and resources, the punitive peace treaty and so on) lead to a higher impact on the culture of the Germany that came after the Empire. [Though make no mistake countries like France suffered dearly, as did Russia]

German culture is still world reknowned and definitely incredibly influential but when looked in comparison to the rest of the world you cannot but help wonder how the world would look if we could have had all those people back and Germany had not lost so much reputation, people and time on the world stage.

By no means did I intend to point to the average German as a war loving warrior, I poorly communicated if this is the impression I gave. The German Empire, like Russia and to an extend the Austro Hungarian Empire were *led* by war loving men and the obedience[whether by social trust, duty, or fear] of their people allowed them to use their own people as a sword.

[I think even Theodore Rosevelt believed that war was like a national workout, and if you didn't keep doing it enough the nation would get flabby and weak, to illustrate other contemporary thinkers and politicians in even a democratic state]

Just wait until EU reciprocates, which they probably will, and then all US-Iranian nationals will have the same issues to travel to Europe. And don't counter with ""just renounce"".

"&gt; hen this infers that the drive for true integration is weak if the original culture still even exists in any noticeable fashion by the 4th generation. 

So you're saying that all Americans that refer to themselves as ""Irish Americans"" are poorly integrated? The Italian-Americans? Poorly integrated ... people still showing signs of Jewish culture after 400 years? Poorly integrated.

Most Arab-Belgians I know cant speak more than two words of Arab, that's really not the point. Besides, when I see the amount of Polski-Sklep's around Brussels, that doesn't show an enormously superior assimilation. 

&gt; Political correctness (adjectivally, politically correct, commonly abbreviated to PC) is a term primarily used as a pejorative to describe language, policies, or measures which are intended not to offend or disadvantage any particular group of people in society; in pejorative usage, those who use the term are generally implying that these policies are excessive.

Yes, not offend. Showing people proper ways of interacting with society won't cause offence and implying people won't tell people that they have to get up for elderly in priority seats because of PC sounds like you're making it up. 

&gt; Now I'm pretty confident there are plenty of white middle class Guardian reading men and women who work in local councils whose white shame is such that the idea of muslim women being targeted to learn English is politically incorrect.

Saying ""People should learn English"" would be politically correct, singling out ""Muslims"" and ""Women"" is ridiculous. What, Muslim men don't have to learn English? Latina's can get away with not learning English? What about Millwall-fans? 

&gt; Back to the original point, I've also seen women who have been clearly African but not muslim not display the same behaviour. In fact I've seen them display kindness and other behaviors that makes me feel like a lesser person.

I have very limited experience, but I once sort-of made friends with a west African Muslim. He went on very long, preachy rambles about his religion and could not understand how you could be anything other than a Christian or a Muslim - he thought they were the only two things you could be. Not atheist, not pagan, not Hindu or anything else. He could not understand.

And then it started getting kind of creepy as he was describing how Muhammed led war against various groups and declared how Muhammed said such-and-such people should all be killed because they were different. Yeah... super fucking awkward. I don't remember the details but the take-home message was convert or die. Every time I spoke to him afterwards he said he prayed that the light of Allah would find its way into my heart. He really could not accept or understand that I didn't believe in Islam, and it was kind of scary.

Now I have a very, very small sample of Muslims I know. The only other one I can think of listens to heavy metal and drinks alcohol (but doesn't eat pork still), and he is an absolutely top dude.

"It's because of anti-colonialism. Anti-colonialists believe that the reason the West is rich has nothing to do with a more modern culture that encourages innovation, scientific discovery and freedom, but is only the result of the West plundering their colonies, impoverishing them by enriching the West. Because of that, they believe that Western countries have a moral debt towards the Third World, therefore the West must allow any resident of these countries access to their country and their citizenship, and must accommodate them, their language and their culture to facilitate that process. On the other hand, Western people moving into these countries are expected to learn the language and assimilate.

Of course, I could point out many rich Western countries that never had empires, or the fact that many former colonies are very rich (Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, etc...), but hey, don't let facts get in the way of a good ol' guilt trip.

That is also why they strongly oppose integration for immigrants. The anti-colonialists see Western culture as uniquely imperialistic and bad.

"It's annoying how [some people] are all for freedom of association when [members of group 1] are hit with it, but make a 180 turn whenever an organisation tries to apply it to distance itself from [members of group 2]. 

Show some intellectual honesty, [some people].  

Be advised that laws didn't create free speech - not any more than they created gun ownership or the pursuit for happiness.  They recognized it. Yes, they are only meant to keep it safe  from the USG, and that means that it's up to regular people to protect it from pretty much all other threats. This does **not** mean expecting / forcing [organizations] to do what 
you feel is right, it means considering [said organizations] discredited when they put [agenda] before [organization's stated goals]. 

Case in point, being negative or even hostile towards Islam does obviously not run contrary to the mission of any organization claiming to support ""science and skepticism"". It runs contrary to the ideas of the US left. 

On a private level, protecting freedom of speech means pointing at hijacked organizations and raising noise. It's not done in an attempt to destroy said organization, but to protect naive information consumers from potentially absorbing propaganda presented to them as facts.

"First off, not everyone dislikes Jews. Having said that, I can think of three things that historically have contributed to some people having animus against Jews:

1. The Catholic church preached a lot of hate for many years, I think because they blamed the Jews for the death of Jesus.
2. Jews have been big on education and learning and did very well in many professions, sometimes being vastly over-represented in terms of their percentage of the overall population. Some of those professions were not very popular with your average Joe, such as money lenders, bankers, lawyers, landlords, etc. for the same reason those professions are not very popular with many today. This led to people blaming Jews for any hardship they may have experienced at the hands of those practicing those professions.
3. More recently, Zionism and the displacing and subjugation of the Palestinians has led some to dislike Jews, even though not all Jews are Israelis. The current government in Israel constantly conflates Jews with Israel and vice versa, but if anyone else does that they are quick to take offense and cry anti-semitism.

I hope you will bear in mind that I am not justifying anyone not liking Jews for any of these or other reasons, just trying to explain the possible genesis of this kind of thing.

"&gt;What's the purpose of arguing with someone you won't convince of something? 

Well, as I said, when has anyone ever been convinced to change their stand point in a TV-debate? When presidential candidates have a debate, it's not to convince each other. Clinton isn't expecting Bush to change his opinion and switch to her side, and similarily, Dawkins isn't expecting his opponent to become an atheist. The purpose is to get your ideas out there. The debate format is just to make it more interesting for the viewer. It's almost entierly about the audience, not the opponent.

As I said earlier, should he not correct someone when they make a factually incorrect claim? If someone says ""Evolution can't be true because there are still monkeys."" should he just let it slide and say nothing? The issue with these kinds of debates is that you put someone who has a great and profound knowledge about something up against someone who fundamentally misunderstands it. Of course he's going to correct them. 

Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, he has stopped doing these debates because he finds that they don't help with what he want to achieve, which is educating people. So...he kind of agrees with you. These kinds of debates are ineffective for what he wants to do. 

Edit: I should add, Dawkins has also expressed criticism of the program format that many debate shows follow, as he finds that they don't make for good conversation. ",1

The joke is that Rouhani's feelings would be somehow inappropriately moved by the sight. He might even get sexually excited and frustrated.

Another part the article is not getting across very well is the ""Islam is in danger"" joke. It's a statement Iranian state propaganda announces all the time for all kinds of reasons. Some of these crusty old Ayatollahs have made melodramatic speeches in the last few years, decrying lack of proper dress code observance by the youth in Iran, by saying over-the-top things like 'The blood of the martyrs is being trampled'.

"If they're here, say, five years before their country stabilizes and in the meantime have acquired a working knowledge of the language and gotten settled into either a business they've started or some other career -- why would deciding that maybe the default shouldn't be uprooting them yet again be insane? This is less of an issue when their home country settles down very quickly after they arrive, but most of the refugees the US has taken over the past 30 years or so wouldn't have their home country become safe for them again for years (and in some cases, the conflicts are ongoing decades later).

It's not clear at all why kicking people out who've been here long enough to be mostly integrated into society benefits us.

But I'm mostly thinking of the US here, which I think is already far, far too strict in terms of immigration in general, both for refugees and others.  (Parent comment was talking about *everywhere*). In the not-even-very-long run (I'm talking maybe 2 generations) I'm convinced that both immigrants and refugees make the host country better off, and within 3 or 4 generations I don't think the descendants of any arriving group will be culturally distinguishable at all from the majority, because this has been the pattern in the United States. 

Taking the most recent issue as an example, I find it very difficult to believe people currently fleeing Syria are more culturally incompatible with the US than Eastern Europeans, Southern Europeans,  and Chinese immigrants were a century ago, and I think those groups unambiguously added value to the US over time, despite some tension at first.",1

"Assuming the refugees, migrants, immigrants  cause criminal offenses because of their race or religion is discriminatory; assuming they're all uneducated, unteachable and corrupt is racist as well.

Preparing security concepts for huge crowds of mostly men of uncertain origin (papers, police record, etc.), with partly low education, of a different or subpar justice system, yet to be integrated into the society and gain a stable financial basis, that is not offensive.  
For instance, sexual harassment and assault are wide-spread in Europe as well as in the Middle East and Africa so an increase in the affected demographic can temporarily lead to an increase in this kind of criminal activity until adaptation has occurred.

On the other hand the population has to be aware of their own deficiencies when facing a crisis instead of seeking refuge in irrational prejudice.  
When the asylum procedure is only affected by criminal offenses which get you more than 3 years but you don't have the man power, tools or awareness to collect the evidence, nor enough people to ensure who's an economic migrant or criminal and that these actually leave the EU, then it isn't surprising common people begin to fear everyone who's new and different.",-1

So lower caste people tend to work labor jobs out in the fields. Higher caste usually were in privileged positions such as priest (brahmin), warriors (kshastriya). Followed by  land owners or merchants ( Vaishyas)  in the middle-tier. Then finally the lowest of the caste is the shudras. Basically the peasants that worked outdoors or hard labor jobs.   So being exposed to harsh outdoors that would result in darker pigmentation. So notably, higher caste people are lighter skinned than those having occupations where they work outdoors. 

At least that's been the theory. Of course, there are plenty of light skinned Indians from lower caste and dark skinned higher caste Indians. A person's lastname in India is probably a better indicator of caste than skin color. ",4

"Not that it matters at all, but it was fascinating for me to watch:

There was an American, whom we think was a paramedic, who smuggled his way into Libya during the civil war to work in the hospitals and eventually ended up taking arms against the Gaddafi regime. It's intense to watch his videos because it's clear from all of his interactions with all of the fighters around him that very few understand how to wage war, how to sustain combat operations, or even what they're advancing to. It was a lot of young men just dashing toward gunfire with no plan and no follow through.

One of his last videos, 3 years ago now, talked about how that was really indicative of the whole fiasco. Where people clamored for the war but without knowing why. 

I wish I could find those videos again, buried deep on youtube. ",4

Where the Americans are 'pivoting to Asia' and are looking to contain isolate and eventually break China to abort its rise to hyperpower status for America is a jealous god and will brook no rivals.

China will not give America even an inch because then America will take a mile.

What did Russia gain for giving America its vote in the UNSC allowing America to invad and destroy Serbia and Libya? What did Russia gain from letting east Germany go where despite sworn promises of no NATO expansion not even an inch east of Germany NATO ignores its promised consideration and expands up to Russias borders surrounds Russia with nukes and ABMs and strike teams?

1) A fetus is alive and human.

4) The killing of humans on an arbitrary basis is usually frowned upon and considered immoral.

5) Thus, if we consider life to be a fundamental right of all humans, then we must extend this to fetuses.

6) If we consider life to be a fundamental right of a subset of humans, then we must define that subset in a defensible manner based on the status of that human.

7) You can define ""healthy human"" as your basis, but what stops us from redefining ""healthy""? What if we decide to make this classification based on financial health? Or mental acuity? Only wealthy geniuses have rights now.

8) You could define ""fully developed humans"" as your basis. But then you wouldn't have the right to live until approximately age 25.

&gt; clean up legacy US messes (Taiwan, Korea, etc), etc...

What the fuck are you talking about? Taiwan hasn't been touched ever since its formation in 1949, and the Korean War was started when North Korea invaded South Korea with Soviet and Chinese support. The Soviets failed in that war, considering South Korea is a major economic power, a stable, wealthy democracy, and a US ally.

Capitalism is the latest form of economic organization based on the conquering of one group of humans by another. I believe that, in the absence of an occupying force, people seek to organize in mutual contracts (both implicit and explicit) which are beneficial for every party involved. This is called socialism. I also believe that with the absence of property (and therefore the concept of theft), people organize into a system which I call communism, which essentially means that people are given what they need in exchange for producing what they must (must being understood to be a social pressure, not an economic or political one).",1

"Step 1: Always be inquisitive, curious, and willing to learn new things. Remind yourself of the impossibility of truly objective information. 

Step 2: Determine the predominant belief system in your country. In the US, the mainstream narrative is unquestionably that of egalitarian progressivism. 

Step 3: Assume that the vast majority of information is disseminated by institutions (e.g. media, government, education) that would label themselves as such and are incentivized to do so for the sake of self-preservation and increasing influence. 

Step 4: Familiarize yourself with political theory and realpolitik by reading books that contradict/contrast what you know from school and the propaganda you encounter daily. Actively seek out criticisms of assigned school work. Actually *read* controversial/hated books and trace the author's arguments back to their philosophic assumptions. Make a real attempt at understanding history by reading from a variety of sources. 

Step 5: Find sites (news, blogs, aggregators) that offer opinions outside the mainstream consensus both ideologically and geopolitically. Remember that information can be a blessing and a curse. It is often used as a weapon in the form of disinformation. 

Step 6: With your newfangled understanding of history, philosophy, and human incentives, you will find that much of what you initially held as true amounts to nothing more than rhetoric. Consider all points of view when reading about events, controversial political movements, etc. If you feel the need to align yourself with a particular narrative (totally natural) make sure you're heavily informed as to both sides of the argument.

"numbers dont matter. If there were only one secular muslim who rejected sharia then i would support that one.

and conversely if all the rest wanted sharia then i would deport, strip citizenship or lock up the rest for treason

the split is not moderate v extremist though with the ignorant reportage i do not blame you for this error

Dr Taj Hargey is a koranic extremist. He rejects sharia. That makes him no problem and in fact our best ally.

The Sunni muslims of Hizb ut-Tahrir are non-violent theocrats. They are a big problem. Huge. They need deporting.

the split is not moderate v extremist. The split is secular v theocrat.

the good thing about democracy is we get to pass the laws for our nations

and the good thing about our nations is we get to decide who migrates here and who does not.

so i think that we should make a public decision and very quickly too that we are going to welcome secular muslims but we will not tolerate theocrats. They will not get access to our country  we will not pander to them nor will we help them overseas or accept their blood money. This would require cutting funding for mosques from theocrats in Saudi Arabia and Iran",1

"Yeeeah, you are spot on. It also goes beyond sexual interaction, that same bias can apply to women that freely discuss sexual or taboo subjects, regardless of our professionalism or candor. The expectation is that we are to be reserved, saint like beings for the sake of face in Public or the presence of Peers, and to deviate just by discussing the subject....is considered unclean or disgusting. For example....

I have been with my husband now for....about 20 years, which is important later on in my story... In my early 20's, I had no problem discussing sex philosophically with a friend or coworkers, or how sex and violence originates from the same area of the brain...and how that relates to rape or emotional manipulation. I also had no problem discussing studies behind other hypersensitive bundles of nerves in the genital or pelvic region besides the clitoris or penis, and how those areas can be targeted and stimulated to provide a multi faceted orgasm other than clitoral or g-spot....

I also discussed how sexual orientation is never black or white, and it was perfectly natural to have preferences or attraction outside of heterosexuality....I even discussed the Dominant/Submissive relationship, rape fantasies, bondage, etc. I was always very careful about our discussions, ensuring that it was never some lewd word play or unprofessional, but a polite yet frank conversation to really delve into the Reality of Sex, and really hash out thoughts or muses. My conversation partners were always the courteous, discreet, yet scholarly type of friend or coworker, and we had some very awesome introspection about a normally taboo subject!

Well, getting back to my husband now....I could have these same conversations with him, and it was as normal as discussing what type of coffee creamer he likes. We both would have been together for about 7-8 years then, and were the typical young adult couple; together long enough to seem like the super stable power couple...yet young enough to still be learning how to effectively communicate and relate to each other.

One day, my husband and I were having a frank conversation about how I felt that some young women choose to have many sexual partners and sometimes irresponsible sex, forsaking a single partner or 'vanilla' sex life....it is sometimes due to rebelling against some power figure that was heavily restrictive (like a parent), or it could be due to some past event that the young woman felt powerless in. My husband stated an opinion I did not quite agree with, and at that moment, a female coworker that was sitting nearby our table at the cafeteria joined in with very sensible but poignant details. Another often very reserved and soft spoken male employee joined in as well, otherwise having a good discussion with my husband and I.

It was the same professional yet politely frank style we talked in, nothing flirtatious, lewd, rude, no innuendos or double meanings. I began to notice my husband getting very quiet when I would speak, and I could instantly tell he disapproved of my candor. After the 2 coworkers left, I was greeted by the same passive aggressive silence paired with no eye contact that I was accustomed to getting from my husband when he was upset. I asked, then quietly demanded to know what the problem was....

He bluntly stated he felt that I had embarrassed him by discussing these topics with other people, implying that they would think I was a slut or unclean just by having a candid conversation. He stated that only sluts or whores are so frank or comfortable discussing such subjects, and people will get the wrong opinion of me....blah blah blah....insert sexist ideals....you get the drift. 

Well....safe to say he eventually grew out thinking insecurely...he is naturally shy and very guarded by nature, however it took our first 10 years for him to grow out of old-world bias and truly let go of baseless fears or assumptions that he grew up with. ",2

Also mind you the majority of settlers are mizrahi/sephardim jewry, who of course are upset when arabs claim they can't settle in jewish land yet they were forced to relocate by arab governments after the founding of israel.

"I know all these things and I don't disagree with everything you said. I'm still not on board with humans causing the extinction of so many mega fauna.  That time was very volatile climate wise, and the big mammals would have been the most affected by these things.  I find that a much simpler answer than to believe that primitive humans were able to wipe out hundreds of millions of large dangerous mammals.  At that time it would take a large effort to kill just one mammoth or other large dangerous creature.  It's hard to imagine the risk was worth the reward, and for it to happen on such a scale worldwide all at once.  How many smaller easier to kill animals were affected at the same time as the mega fauna?  I'm not an expert in this but I am reasonably sure that the Holocene extinction includes mostly large mammals.  Correct me if I'm wrong on that.  I just think it's  simpler that climate change was the major cause considering the type of animals that went extinct, and that the more assumptions you make the messier things become when explaining them.  I'm not secure enough in that belief that I'm not open to changing my mind here, and I'm mostly just being a devils advocate.

With the turtles however it's pretty well established that humans did not cause them to die off in such large numbers. They aren't starving (except for the occasional loggerhead), they get sick all the damn time, they don't breed fast enough, they take a long time to reach sexual maturity, and they don't migrate properly.  All this would be fine in a stable climate, but like I said before the recent past was very volatile.  As for the numbers it's gets messy because of how much moving around they do.  That 75000 figure is this years estimate for the east coast and the Caribbean which are for all intents and purposes the same population.

&gt;De Maizière: Es ist jedenfalls eine verdammt große Herausforderung, sie ist größer, als wir alle bisher gedacht haben – gesellschaftlich, politisch, ökonomisch, kulturell. Zwei Beispiele: Aktuell leben rund vier Millionen Muslime in unserem Land, viele von ihnen mit türkischem Migrationshintergrund. Jetzt werden wir Hunderttausende arabisch geprägte Muslime bekommen, und das ist, nach allem, was mir mein französischer Kollege sagt, ein erheblicher Unterschied in Sachen Integration. Zweites Beispiel: Das Qualifikationsniveau der Menschen, die zu uns kommen, ist sehr unterschiedlich. Ich selbst habe mit Tierärzten und Ingenieuren aus Syrien gesprochen, aber die Verantwortlichen vor Ort sagen mir, sie rechnen mit einem Anteil von 15 bis 20 Prozent erwachsenen Analphabeten.

"I would imagine that this might be the case with many countries where Race and Nationality mean the same thing and I think being an ancient Civilization also has an influence (longer, more entrenched racial/national history).

Take India for example, I could totally imagine the same situation here. A white guy could come and live in India all his life and even get citizenship but he will never ""become Indian"" as far as the locals are concerned. He will always be ""the white guy"" or ""the American"" and his kids will always remain ""the white kids"". Its because in these countries Race and Nationality mean the same thing and thats what they have seen all their lives. So its weird for them to accept that these can be two different things.

Thats one of the things I admire about America. The fact that race and nationality are disconnected in a very real way i.e. People don't make assumptions about your nationality based on your race.",1

because those people all self identify as belonging to the nation of islam. 

There might be a minority that arent very devout but on a whole muslims tend to be much more serious about their faith than their Abrahamic brother religions.

This is also something nearly anyone who is a muslim would think is a good and right thing, to them islam controlling government is not a radical idea, to them a radical idea is that women are equal to men.

Theyre muslim because they truly believe islam is the direct word of god, and it is wonderful and magnificent etc etc etc.

Why wouldnt they want that thing they thi9nk is the most important thing in the world to be in charge of their country, as the faith commands to ensure happens?

"I'm not saying they *do* have a gang rape culture, but there are some pieces left that can have a serious influence on us. That ted talks is a brilliant lady that lectures about the portrayal of women in media. You can find her documentary ""Killing Us Softly"".

Short summary would be:

-Many advertisements imply eminent rape (man in the background approaching a woman from behind, hands surrounding a woman, woman lying on a table with men all around her)

-Many advertisements show women as both childish yet sexual

-Many advertisements show women in physically inferior positions compared to men being advertised in superior positions

-The focus on skinny women show women that they should be less, literally smaller in our physical space

I seriously recommend watching the Killing Us Softly documentary. It's a great way to show how every day media may influence us more than you think, and that perhaps women aren't viewed as greatly as we think in western society.

"I'm not getting into treaty issues here. I'm getting into the fact that a tribal leader of an absolute minority of New Zealanders is using a political difference with the government to make an utterly ridiculous statement about what is supposed to be New Zealand's national holiday.

I frequently hear people complain that us 'pakeha' don't buy into Waitangi Day, but then, at the same time, the Maori seek to constantly make the day solely about themselves. It can't be a national day if it only represents a seventh of the population; and particularly not if that minority keeps using it as a tool to insult and undermine their political opponents.

It's easy to counter my argument with racial statements like you did, with absolutely no understanding of my heritage or background (I am not New Zealand born, nor do I identify as pakeha), but that doesn't make my points less important. If you want to believe that I'm anti-Maori rights, then go ahead. I personally don't think we should give people special places in politics and economics purely based on the circumstances of their birth. Culturally, the get a say, but economically they can vote like the rest of us.

As for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it has good points and bad points. Unfortunately we haven't really seen anyone give it a fair evaluation to make me certain that the overall outcome would be good or bad for NZ. What I do know is that I don't trust the government who need this to look good, I don't trust the opposition who are desperate for it to look bad (despite having been behind the thing from the get go) and I certainly don't trust irrelevant tribal leaders who have no understanding of economics, politics or the best interests of New Zealand.",-8

The religious schism was a result, not the cause of the wars. Once upon a time Christianity tried to be the connecting glue that would unite all peoples. It failed. So will fail Islam too.

&gt;Went to a Korean school did she? Only associated with other Koreans did she? Surrounded by hundreds of thousands of other Koreans is she? No? Then it's not an issue is it?

Nearly all of her friends are korean, all her coworkers used to be korean, she speaks korean a lot of the time with her family and friends rather than english, although obviously she isn't a recluse. People stick together in groups, it's what they do, it's not harmful.

which ghettos in london do you refer to? not disputing Paris has a problem, but then they have a much more rigid insistance on immigrants bowing to their ways (see banning burkhas etc)

How do you define massive immigration? I'll say it - there are limits on what level of acceptable immigration can happen. It would be silly to have 20 million people appear tomorrow yes. But I don't see much of a problem with the levels of today.

It's easy to make the bomb the taboo but there are really much deeper problems and questions about mankind to be resolved. Even without the atomic bomb conventional warfare can tear civilisation apart.

The American public not being able to own arms means they are then totally under the mercy of their government. I don't like it in the UK that it's now very hard to take down the government if they really fuck up. They can act with impunity slowly creeping towards whatever ends they want.

There exists a hyper-advanced, intergalactic society of city-sized AI spaceships called Reapers that wipe out all spacefaring sapient species in the galaxy roughly every 50,000 years. They do this by having constructed a vast network of relays that allow faster-than-light travel from one fixed point to another, which all eventually converge in a 20-km long hub spacestation that was custom built to serve as a logically inevitable galactic capital for each victim civilization. They work their way through the network picking off each inhabited planet, taking care not to disturb fringe worlds or ones that are populated by non-space-age species.

These are the people that feminists and the LGBT community have been demanding Europe must let in. Well guess what- in many of their countries gay people get stoned to death or thrown in prison and most people are cool with it. And women are treated like they are inferior and the property of men. So imagine you live in a small German town of 7,000 people and suddenly there are 500 of these mostly young, sexually frustrated men now living in your town. Whereas women once felt safe walking the dog at night they now fear going out- and rightly so. Gay people, which most Germans have no problem, enrage the new guests to the point where they want to kill them. Expect more stories like this. The immigration is not stopping.

I'll give you 1. because that's more of a ""Are you racist?"" question than anything else. 

2\. should clearly be answered no, it's a simple question and you tried to evade it as much as possible by generalising the question. 

3\. Is exactly why you are so scared to answer any questions directly, you believe that since others hold the same views even though they live in more developer countries, it's okay to do so as well. The problem is, those who do are fundamentalists as well, they are the extremists of their religion. People who deem homosexuality immoral are extremists by the very definition.

&gt; OK, this is actually a good question to ask. 

Which you didn't answer. 

5\. Were, my friend. Maybe you are just trying to wash up the defintion of ""moderate"" or what you view as moderate Islamist is just very different to what other people perceive as moderate, I am not sure. What I am sure about is the fact that you couldn't answer a single question and you believe that radicalism in coherence with religion is about murder. (and that alone)

Extremisim doesn't just mean to kill for your beliefs, Sharia law is extremist because it represents the limits of someone's views. To believe in extremist ideas of one's religion is extremist. The thing is, many Islamic views are extremist by themselves if you compare them to Western standards. You might be a ""moderate muslim"" but you can still be an extremist in the eyes of others.

I am saying the premise of it to begin with is not verifiable, so to point it out to me as some kind of major point for me to take seriously is not going to happen. 

First of all, not once did I give any opinion on the poll, so telling me that ""I don't like the poll"" is not even correct, that's just you projecting your bias upon me and assuming what I feel or think - and we all now that's just wrong, right?

I am not trying to point that out to make fun of you, but I just really don't understand what you are saying.

anyhow, the relationship between Erdogan's regime and Sisi's is down the shit since the coup/revolution in 30/6 two years ago. Erdogan vehemently backed the Muslim brotherhood regime then and was very vocal in opposition to the coup/revolution and Sisi personally.  Turkey is also backing Hamas in Gaza which is an off-shoot of the general muslim-brotherhood movement (how strong the link between the one in egypt and Hamas is debateable) which also supported the muslim brotherhood governemnt in egypt and opposed the coup and Sisi, therefore a hateful sentiment toward Hamas in Egypt began to take hold as the media spreads the impression that they have a hand in the 'terrorism' in the Sinai which is at border with Gaza.  the Egyptian military cracked down on terrorism in Sinai and strongly withheld the border with Gaza drowning tunnels regularly, all with coordination with ISrael since the 78' camp david summit between egypt and Israel resulted in an agreement which restricted the presense of the Egyptian military in Sinai and especially near the border.  as a result the relationship between Sisi's Egypt and Israel is pretty good in contrast to it's relationship to Hamas's Gaza, as evidently shown in the last Israeli 'war' with Gaza in 2014 when Egypt tried to play it's role, as it regularly did, in initiating cease-fire only this time it was awkward and clear Hamas and Sisi's Egypt were not friends.",8

"A time when the rapid expansion of Islam provoked a large scale response of Christianity to defend their existence? Or more specifically, when the Eastern Roman Empire (The Byzantine Empire) lost control over large swaths of lands to Islamic expansion and pleaded with Europe for help, as they felt that they would no longer be able to hold back Islam. Then finally when the Seljuk Turks closed off access to Jerusalem to Non-Muslims it was seen as too much for Europe to not come together over. 

Or are you one of those people that believe all of Europe (which had devolved in a cesspool of near unending warfare) came together just to beat on those poor Muslims? That myth really needs to stop. 

I mean I could go more in to it if you want. The Seljuk Turks (a steppe tribe) had invaded and taken over like half the Muslim lands outside of Spain. They owned all of modern Afganistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc. All the way up to Egypt. They were REALLY REALLY in to being Muslim after their conversion and eventually pushed super conservative and actually wrong version of Islam, punishing all those that didn't obey them. They took over Jerusalem and cut it off to non-Muslims (which they weren't supposed to do, btw.) That's why the Egyption Muslims (the Fatmids) actually attacked them during the same time as the Crusades, as even the Muslims were against the Seljuks.

Sure, you get a fair number of genuine psychopaths drawn to the ""fun,"" but most of these people are driven by mindless fear and anger. The problem for the *average participant* is a deep-seated psychological one. 

I certainly don't claim to have a full understanding of the equation, but normal people don't have to be taught not to suicide bomb 4-year olds, enslave each other, etc. The sort of brainwashing required to turn someone around on that issue is sort of terrifying to even contemplate. 

This shit happens (excluding the true psychopaths) when people feel dehumanized and in turn dehumanize others. Maybe it's the honor culture combined with complete lack of opportunity. It's not unlike what we're seeing with some poor men in the US.

"To some extent maybe you're right, but I think suggesting that it's an intelligence thing is also dangerous. Look at the very qualified people who are creationists. Granted it's not as widespread and it's not akin to killing children, but it's symptomatic of the human ability to compartmentalise conflicting views and believe dogma contrary to all evidence. The pervasiveness of dogmatic thinking and powerful people willing to exploit that (I would hazard a guess) is the real reason, but that isn't really in the control of the individual, but mostly a function of their upbringing and society - things we can control and work on.

Even if it's a case of lack of intelligence (which I don't really think it is, if anything it's a lack of availability of knowledge, which is why I think religion is declining in the West with greater access to the Internet) that can be addressed by better education to start with.

I just don't like the dismissal of ""it's evil"" because it's basically saying ""we can't do anything about it, and never will be able to - some people are evil and that's that"" and I strongly disagree with that sentiment.",1

"Britain was NOT, in the 1770s, going to let go of America.  Prior to the revolution, Britain refused to grant Americans any representation in parliament - the parliament which imposed taxes on economic activity in the colony.  That's what the fight was originally about.  Taxation without representation.  Britain didn't want to let go of the American colony, but it didn't want the colony to have any political representation at all, period.  So no, there was no way to 'negotiate' the freedom for America.

As for the eastern regions of Ukraine, certainly there are some that want to return to Russia.  But it is not a majority (only RT News would claim differently).  And the easterners have representation in the Ukrainian parliament.  They may not have as much political power there as they would like, but they aren't shut out of it.  They've been offered greater political power, too.  And they aren't seeking independence.  So it isn't the same as America in the 1770s.  

And what I said was that Putin wanted to take part of Ukraine - and in particularly to have a land bridge from Russia to Crimea - because of the tremendous logistical challenges of supplying Crimea without one.  Yes, he wants that.  If it weren't for international condemnation, he'd have taken that little slice already.  But it may suit him better to just keeping sending little green men into eastern Ukraine and keep up the turmoil.",1

"Well, there is a hypothesized phenominon that even particles separated long distances may still have quantum entanglement.  Imagine you have two particles in a closed system, and when you alter one of the particles characteristics, such as spin, it *can* altar the characteristics of the other particle without you interacting with it.  This is known as 'quantum entanglement' (well, I probably simplified the simplified version I read of it, but fuck it I'm rolling with it).  It does not necessarily need to happen in a closed system.  It is mathematically possible for particles even light years apart to have quantum entanglement, and the altered state in the second particle happening instantly, this called 'spooky action' because if it does somehow send information to the other particle, it must arrive there much faster than the speed of light.  If this does indeed prove to happen in the physical world, one could find a way to force particles to become entangled, scan a person particle by partice and pretty much print the other person on the other side.

"That was meant in a more general sense. 
I'm not sure there is a ""source"" for a complex topic. 
First there are obvious parallels to the various bubbles in the U.S. in recent history. Housing primarily. Currency devaluation over the past few years either directly or indirectly by capital controls and quantitative easing.
Corruption between government and finance. Collateralized debt obligations and lack of regulatory oversight. The revolving door between government and finance.
Then you have the larger issue of the economic integration between China and the U.S. 
If one runs into serious trouble it will effect the other in various ways. 
China has been spending their foreign exchange reserves to support their currency while at the same time they are reducing their holdings of U.S. debt. This can have a feedback effect on trade for both countries. Certainly the debt will be purchased by others and things will go on, but there is an impact.
My personal opinion is that in the U.S. there is a tendency to ignore even recent history. 
In many areas there seems to be an arrogance that the U.S. is doing well and China is having difficulties. I guess that is to be expected since the story for many years was that China was ascending while the U.S. was past its prime. 
Things can change quickly and there are some extremely negative indicators for the U.S. economy right now. Manufacturing is likely already in a recession. Rail usage has dropped. 
Stock markets are becoming more volatile. Overvaluations in various sectors possibly including tech. 
Oil prices. While it does help the consumer and certain industries in the U.S., there is a negative impact as well. The shale companies which have played a role in economic growth over the past few years will likely go bankrupt or have a very difficult time surviving. 
Oil is also traded in dollars so I wouldn't discount the impact cheap Oil can have on our economy as a whole. Few people seem to be talking about the pending student loan crisis as well.
So there are many similarities and some unique challenges for each country. 
Both countries have grown to be very interconnected in ways that might not be immediately apparent. For example, when you want to find out how much U.S. debt China holds (and has been selling) you have to look at Belgium, since they hold many custodial accounts for the Chinese. 
The last point I'll make is that as we see China go through these difficulties we should keep in mind their recent economic history even if we can easily forget our own. 
After all, they have learned a lot about the modern economy from the U.S. since the 70s.

The South African truth and reconciliation commision that investigated crimes committed during the apartheid years made zero reference to any blacks being raped and in all the years from 1948 to 1992 there less than a thousand blacks killed in total within the borders of South Africa by whites in any way whatsoever.
Please go check out the TRC website: http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/
As for the claim that they were enslaved that is also incorrect, the whites created vastly more jobs for blacks than had ever existed and people worked for a salary. The average life expectancy of blacks increased under white rule from 35 years to 65 years, quite a jump. By 1990 more than a 100 000 blacks were enrolling into, white funded, universities.

"Refugee who migrated to Germany in '86 here. If it's the same old policy then it's bullshit. Granted policies can vary region by region.

-Lived as a kid in a refugee camp outside Frankfurt for +2 years. Then were moved to a small city in NRW (North-West Germany)
-Parents weren't allowed to work for 4 years. 
-Refugee status ""Duldung"" had to be renewed every 6 month, during which the situation in our home country got reevaluated.
-No language courses offered to parents - hard to integrated when living in an isolated camp with fellow refugees.

After four years got Semi-residency ""Aufenthaltsgenehmigung"" to be renewed every two years, then four years, then ""unbefristet"", which is the equivalent of permanent residency. 

Got my German citizenship after 14 years. 

I, as well as my siblings, got to go to kindergarten, school and university - which was nice.

"There are actually studies that show that getting rid of mosquitoes would have little effect on the ecosystem. Just thinks about this alright: 180,000 mosquitos = 1 pound.

Bats eat them for some of their food and still have to eat THOUSANDS an hour to make it worth their time. It is predicted that another more harmless insect will take the place of mosquitoes. Sure, humans could do nothing about them because it might slightly effect the ecosystem (something that is definitely not good) or we could stop the death and suffering of billions. We have and continue to do far worse things to the planet. If we got rid of mosquitos in Africa then say, the people are able to live their lives without death a bite away, the countries develop, pollution goes down, countries can rely on the gold mine of solar power they are living on and the earth is treated better.

"&gt; Wait, Zimbabwe went poor because white people left ?_? I thought they where why Zimbabwe was bad in the first place? And that the natives wanted whites to go away to begin with?

As /u/merehow said, whites had a lot of businesses and farms, and yes they did have a higher standard of living than blacks. Though there was well-developed infrastructure for the time, and everyone had access to healthcare and education:

https://youtu.be/0S2NKlMW0vc?t=545

The white government of Ian Smith accepted to hold elections, and a black president was elected, along with a black-majority parliment. This was still not satisfactory for Mugabe who at the time was a rebel-leader and refused to lay down arms. You can read more about this here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesian_Bush_War#Resolution

&gt; Also how come the natives didn't just take over the whites farms and continue to produce food and aquire wealth?

Because the land wasn't given to ""the people"", it was redistributed to Mugabe loyalists who had no intention of toiling in the fields or paying anyone to do so.

There's also the knowledge loss to consider: imagine someone gives you a plot of land, a bag of seeds and says ""alright, you're now a farmer, get to work!"". What's the best time to plant crops? How and how often are they to be irrigated? How do you deal with pests and crop loss? How are you going to collect and sell the crops?

This is the danger of brain-drain that /u/lpc211 [dismisses so out-of-hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3zpeng/south_africa_to_criminalise_racism/cyo1oxl): it has a far-reaching and crippling effect when it happens on a large scale:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight#Zimbabwe_.28Rhodesia.29

From the article:

&gt; From a strictly economic point of view, the departure figures were not as significant as the loss of the skills of those leaving.[41] A disproportionate number of white Zimbabwean emigrants were well educated and highly skilled. Among those living in the United States, for example, 53.7% had a bachelor's degree, while only 2% had not completed secondary school.[45] Most (52.4%) had occupied technical or supervisory positions of critical importance to the modern sector of the economy.[45] Inasmuch as black workers did not begin making large inroads into apprenticeships and other training programs until the 1970s, few were in a position to replace their white colleagues in the 1980s.[41]

Mugabe treated the country as his own little fiefdom, shared no power and he and his cronies grossly mismanaged every sector of government and the economy.

To address your larger point though, I don't think the statement ""there is no place for the supernatural in my worldview"" is gnostic in the way you mean it to be. It recognizes the limits of the speaker's knowledge by evoking his own personal worldview - it leaves room for the supernatural, even if the speaker actively believes it to be impossible. This statement can still be true even if the speaker believes there are gods, but that they are so far above the day-to-day lives of us earthbound mortals that their existence makes no discernible difference. This is a statement about what the speaker knows there is room for in his worldview, not a statement about what he know about the existence/non-existence of the supernatural.

If he said instead, ""There are no gods"", this would be a claim to specific knowledge about the non-existence of gods - a gnostic atheist claim. And as I said, very few atheists go this far.",2

And this is where we disagree. Take the well-educated westerners who decide to join ISIS. There are in fact people who are only doing terrible things because *they actually believe* that they are commanded by God to do these things, and therefore that makes these things inherently good. They see no problem with slaughtering children precisely because they *believe* that by slaughtering them, the children go directly to paradise. They believe that they did those kids a favor. Belief has a direct effect on behavior. 

I don't think that a world that outgrows religion will be a peaceful utopia free of war or violence. War and violence are sadly a part of the human condition. But all of the good that *is* done as a part of religion: community, the sense of feeling a part of something that is bigger than oneself, charity, etc.. all of those can be found in other places and for other reasons that don't also bring along the consequences of tribalism, dogmatism, and iron age mythology.",6

"&gt; You have proof of this?

I gave you a solid example. Computer programming was a field for women until society chose to market it differently. Suddenly there are very few female computer programmers. Unless you are suggesting that we underwent a rapid evolution in the last few decades. It was not until there was a concerted effort by the few men in the field to push women out, running adverts describing them as inefficient and error prone, creating exclusive professional associations that forbade women from joining. Here is an article for you:

http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/computer-programming-used-to-be-womens-work-718061/?no-ist

&gt;As have we all.

You're mistaken. Men are not discouraged from entering STEM fields because of their gender. They are not told that the set of genitals they were born with makes it such that they cannot or should not pursue these types of careers. You're clearly being very obtuse to ignore my litany of specific examples and instead dismiss it under 'well everyone is told discouraging things some times.' How often has your teacher told you that your existence in the classroom was a distraction? How often have you been mistaken for the secretary of your department rather than a fully qualified professional in that field? How many times have you been assumed incompetent, talked over, or ignored simply because of your gender?

&gt;No, I'm expecting them to have a spine.

So you're simply going to hand-wave the fact that people of all backgrounds are discouraged by things - and because you personally don't think women should be given incentives to work in STEM you will expect women to be entirely immune to societal pressures?

&gt;Yeah but the question becomes if it solely because of society or biology. Some claim there is.

You entirely missed the point. I told you to ask those men if they had consciously chosen not to cry at some point in their lives because they were pressured not to by society. This entirely avoids the biology argument because it is a conscious decision. It assumes there is a situation when the men felt an urge to cry already existed, they would have cried, but they made the decision not to.

This is important because it is an example of men ignoring and preventing a biological process within their bodies from taking place simply because of the social pressure applied to them not to cry. That level of conditioning would be many orders of magnitude higher than simply not electing to pursue a specific field of study. 

&gt;Hostile? such a loaded word. I wanted a reasoning for it.

You are ignoring my arguments, and suggesting that incentives to overcome negative social pressure are akin to 'cuddling.' That is hostility.

The resultant mess has the same number of neutrons+protons, so you aren't really changing that value.

The protons and neutrons you end up with are less tightly bound than the original atoms, so you effectively turned energy into mass. 

The reason that smashing atoms is hard it that you have to get these balls of protons moving very fast, fast enough so that when two balls of protons hit, they will be able to overcome the huge repulsive force of all of the protons in each nucleus. This is the Coulomb Barrier. It is about 3-5 femtometers from the nucleus. After you get past that barrier, the strong nuclear force takes over and pulls the ball together. 

However, smash them together too fast and the whole mess breaks apart completely.

However, truces and alliances usually tend to last for at least a few generations, so the ambassadors hanging around the palace would almost surely become familiar with the royal family and their progeny from infancy on. As I understand it, ambassadors often became important and trusted political advisors to the ruler, at least in relation to the region of their native land, and often a member of the inner palace community.

Ambassadors had a vested interest in becoming valued as an individual by the ruler, since they would naturally prefer to get the choice of defecting or going home in case of war than being executed.",1

He is very well liked by western officials for his pro-Americanism and ruthless anti-terrorism efforts (I mean real terrorism here, AQ and Isis). Here is he meeting [Obama](http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/7IsgM20iZM_sq.GDDlro_A--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztmaT1maWxsO2g9Mzc3O2lsPXBsYW5lO3B4b2ZmPTUwO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT03NTt3PTY3MA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/3838f8d36aca5f15760f6a706700cb02.jpg), [Cameron](http://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2015/02/26/be051cff-41df-43cc-a05a-8c5df7036769/be051cff-41df-43cc-a05a-8c5df7036769_16x9_788x442.jpg) and [Hollande](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BLgo-2iCEAEwnuM.jpg)

But he is also a hard-liner who led a crack down against liberals and campaigners for political and women’s rights reforms. He actually made things worse because he made the oppression system more streamlined and efficient. That is why the number of executions has sky-rocketed in the last year. This also is why so many people over there hate the west, because our leaders shake hands with people responsible for their misery.

So you concede that Amnesty International did not in fact accuse the YPG of genocide. 

This is important. When ISIS attacked the Yazidi, they didn't ""displace"" (massacre and enslave) people randomly (merely because of individual actions or some general sentiment amongst their fighters), but with ideological justification and full intent. The YPG didn't attack Arab Sunnis, they have Arab Sunnis and Assyrians in their ranks and as allies. The displacement in northern Syria wasn't just ""short of genocide"", it simply wasn't genocide.

"Multiplying primes is a simple process 
e.g. 11 x 13 = 143

Reversal of this process - known as factorization - is much harder
e.g. if someone asks you ""which primes do you need to multiply to get 143?"" you probably wont be able to answer quickly

A lot of encryption relies on this simple mathematical property: factorization takes much more time than multiplication. Of course it is not so easy.

****

You use prime numbers, because every other number is build by multipliying prime numbers.

e.g.

1 x 5 = 5 (here basically the number = prime itself)

2 x 3 = 6

2 x 2 x 3=12 

Non-prime numbers are not really interesting for you, because at the end of the day, they are simply made of few primes multiplied together (as in example above: 6 is a non-prime number, thus we do not write that 2 x 6 = 12).",1

"Well, if you live in a democratic country, you live in a place where the majority of people's ignorances, values, and desires ultimately guide those of the government you live in. 

Arguably more important, in a modern Democracy a constitution limits the ability of the majority government of fucking up your individual life. In China, the constitution and the courts are owned by the party, neither will protect you in any way.

In addition, if you live in a two party state under outdated election laws like first past the post, you have two parties that keep each other in check by each attempting to point out the flaws of the other for entirely selfish reasons. 

 In addition, if you have a problem with the government, you can feel free to post about it on the internet (blocked and replaced with a censored version in China),  read about it in free newspapers with anti government agenda(No Chinese newspaper will contradict the government in any way). 

In addition to this, if you and all 700 people in your workfloor are being exploited you can strike for better conditions! Hey, you can even meet with other people in public (or in private, a guy just got a three year house arrest sentence for a private party to commemorate Tiananmen square) and loudly call for the government to change, until you annoy people so much that they ask the government to stop and just give you what they want! 

And you know how bad the insular rigged two parties are? Imagine if there were no primaries and nothing but consulting among themselves to elect someone, and appoint them your leader!

If you live in a western country, odds are that you can move to a city from the countryside and have the same rights as a native city member, but that's not true in China. I bet you didn't even know that discrimination against someone not from the city with worse schools and harder housing was even a thing.

Let's say that there's a huge explosion that wipes out a few city blocks, like the one last year, do you think people would just take that sitting down and accept it in a western country? Moreover, because we aren't so hugely corrupt as China, such an amazing breach is much harder to imagine happening! Just compare the poisoning of people with faulty water to the explosion, in one, blame is actually being assigned to people with power. 

If you are religious (or even if you aren't), you can appreciate that in the west the state almost never discriminates based on religion, and doesn't force people to worship in secret. A huge amount of Chinese Christians who don't follow the authority of the state church worship in private secret 'house churches' and are often discriminated against or have their churches torn down. 
 
Finally, to get back to my point. In a developed country like Spain and the UK dealing with independence, people vote, it goes to courts, people are allowed to speak out- no one sets themselves on fire over it and has it covered up. In Tibet, over 100 have died from self immolation in the last 6 years.

**TLDR**; none of this means that the two party system is good, or the best that China could have. All this says is that those of us who do are lucky to live in Democracies, because at the very least we can try to make them better and question our leaders.  

I haven't even mentioned alleged genocide and mass organ harvesting (yeah mass organ harvesting) like what happened to Falun Gong, or the way that China is trying to destroy the Tibetan language and have Chinese colonize Tibet.

To answer your question at the start, China isn't even remotely communist, and that's not why you should oppose it. ",3

Don't know how frequently that happens though.

In fact someone like [Tommy Robinson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)) shows just how difficult it is to be imprisoned for your examples. He was imprisoned for fraud, despite being leader of the far-right ""English Defence League"". 

If, hypothetically, he'd been seen stood on his EDL platform shouting *right lads, get the bats, we're going to smash us some Muslim skulls* and didn't personally go on a violent rampage but others did or prepped for it (eg got arrested en route didn't beat anyone) he could be done for inciting the violence, if he joined in he could be done for the inciting and the violent rampage. If he just stood on the stage and ranted about England being a Christian country, Muslim paedophile gangs age running the streets etc and its time to *take our country back* and some of the listening racists decided of their own accord to go beat up a Pakistani shop owner it would be pretty unlikely anything would happen to him, other than having a massive police file on him. I wondered if the phase *getting them on their taxes* was relevant to his case when he went to prison.

Anyway, the latter being the reality for most of his doings, despite being very obviously spouting hate. Same explanation for the right wing press can spout very borderline anti-islamic/homophobic/sexist crap....they are spouting hate, but unless they specifically call for a specific illegal action it is generally legal (I sat generally as there have been a few reasonably high profile complaints about newspaper articles inciting hatred).

Not sure that makes it any clearer.... basically ""hate crime"" isn't a crime in itself but other crimes can be hate crimes by the nature if their motivation. Here's the gov definition:

[Crimes committed against someone because of their disability, gender-identity, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation are hate crimes and should be reported to the police.
Hate crimes can include: threatening behaviour, assault, robbery, damage to roperty, inciting others to commit hate crimes, harassment.](https://www.gov.uk/report-hate-crime)

These Isis leaflets are different because they're being done under the terror umbrella. I welcome examples proving me wrong, but I very much doubt anyone would get 3 years for handing out leaflets trying to recruit people to their white power group. The difference (IMO) being hate crime like that is organised hate but not organised criminal activity....random beatings of gay/black people, harassing women in burkhas, throwing bacon at mosques...individual attacks and a lot of rhetoric. And they attack minorities not the state. Thus Isis (or IRA) recruitment is treated differently to other hate filled organisations.",2

"Right lets clear some things up here because I'm reading a lot of people knee-jerking about the state of our education which is utter fucking nonsense.

First off, I'm 20, come from England and went to a typical mixed state comp in a low / mid income area.

This is not the fault of the education system. This is the fault of society in general failing to see the importance of education full stop. This result does not surprise me at all, but something which has to be said is that our education system is not the reason this has happened. Whilst its by no means the best out there, it is NOT utter garbage.

The fact is, as a society, we have come to undervalue education. MANY of my peers from secondary school fucked about, didn't listen to the teachers, and treated their whole school life as a joke. Fundamentally, this was DOWN TO THEM and not due to the teachers. The teachers at my school gave 100% their fucking best, and it was great. Those who knuckled down, listened to the teachers, revised and actually used the support that was being offered did damn well. Unsurprisingly, those who decided that 'study leave' was code for, 'lets hang about down the chippy', or 'lets go home and play playstation for hours', came out with shit results that frankly their parents were happy with. Their parents were pushing their kids for C's (which here in the UK is baseline acceptable, because anything from A* - C is considered a good pass). The kids didn't care about getting the best marks, and I'm sorry but anyone who says teachers need to encourage kids more need to fucking well go and sit in a lesson sometime - because whilst you can lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink. These kids had no damn intention of learning, they simply didn't care, and it was an attitude that was reinforced by their parents and society as a whole which has perpetuated this idea that getting a C is a great mark and what you need to get. A prime example was parents evenings. We'd go, and sit with our parents, and wait to be seen by our respective class teachers. Time and time again, you'd hear the parents sticking up for their child when the teacher was telling them that their kid was essentially a nightmare to teach with little to no interest whatsoever.


Our education and school system is fine. The problem is that the kids are too bone idle and lazy to actually bother paying attention and revising and using it. Ive seen teachers try and inspire kids, but believe me theres only so much a teacher can do when the wider world they are aiming for is to work in a fucking hairdressers which requires and NVQ that needs a C in english maths and science.",1

However, it was Islam, a whole 1000 years prior, that actually distinguished childhood from adulthood - for example, early Muslims only allowed boys to enter war at the age of 15, a very radical reform for the time given (the Crusaders sent 8-year old boy soldiers into the Middle East, just as a reference). Indian, Chinese, Arab, Jewish, Western societies ALL had marriage at a very young age back in the day. Also, considering that many middle school children in America are having their first sexual experiences, I don't understand what's problematic with Islam's rulings. Keep in mind that marriage is the basis for any sexual contact between genders. ",-5

You could if you wanted prevent a little girl from starving to death by doing exactly what the perverts do but just don't ask for sex in return.

However, as I've said, a perverts desire for underage sex is greater than your desire to help a little girl.

If the perverts can go help little girls then fuck them you could go help little girls and not fuck them.

You simply don't desire it enough. 

That's true for me as well. Knowing that I wont do anything about it even though I could, simply because its too much effort, I cannot then hypocritically condemn either the prostitute or the pervert keeping her alive, unless the prostitute is a slave.

Voters could vote for extreme interventions and with agreement from the target countries extract every little underage prostitute to their first world democracy where theyd be fed clothed housed and protected from perverts.

So why don't they do it? Because they are liars. Liars liars liars. They do not care even if it didn't take one ounce of effort from them, only a hundred dollars each in extra tax money, they would rather keep their hundred dollars than save every underage prostitute.

That's where college graduate programs come into play; to get working experience.  They can be completed in 1-2 years, and provide experience in an actual job setting of the profession being sought.  In the end, your employment history and references are used together with your university degree to provide an edge over those with just head knowledge.

He hypothesized that a section of the leftists ""genuinely believe"" that they are fighting an ""ideological war"" against neoconservative and neocolonialist foreign policies of Western governments which promote state-organized violence and chaos in the form of wars and military invasions. On the contrary, when it comes to denounce the randomized acts of violence of theocratic extremists such as Islamists, the same leftists forego their duty to criticize such acts of violence and prioritize to focus on the bigger evil of state-sponsored violence and war. Sometimes, they even ""make alliances"" with some of the most regressive, theocratic and murdering regimes and organizations. Nawaz labels these people regressive leftists. He then cites the example of Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the British Labour Party, who ""has been historically very close"" to supporters of Islamist extremist organisations like Hamas and Hezbollah that target civilians to make their point. In Nawaz's opinion, it is possible to denounce both neoconservative foreign policies (such as the Iraq war which he had opposed) and theocratic extremism, but the regressive leftists fail to do so*",-3

If you're basically unemployable and receiving welfare there's very little incentive to work and very little opportunity to better yourself to get good work. Well, kinda, in the UK there's lots of opportunity I'm proof as a mature student back in education, but it's hard, it's very hard and not everyone can do it.

The argument for a basic income as I understand it is that it gives people more room to better themselves, to work part time and study and maybe through this employers will have more of an incentive to pay better and improve conditions. It's the old dream automation used to provide, the 3 day week etc, removing tedious jobs leaving people more room for humanity to study math and philosphy. And it basically goes back into the local economy anyway.

The trouble is it's just not affordable for most countries.

"&gt;&gt;I've seen plenty of Amnesty International reports heavily criticize the governments of Palestine as well as Israel. So no I don't think they're biased against Israel

&gt;Let's play a game. How many reports have been written by Amnesty criticizing Palestinian governments?

&gt;&gt; It's just when a country has so many human rights violations, and get called on it, people of that country committing those violations start to think that they're the victim, for whatever reason with all that blood on their hands.

&gt;Or maybe many of those ""violations"" are not actually violations, like when 17 [""journalists""](http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/Data/articles/Art_20771/E_013_15_299752333.pdf) were killed during the last war. Maybe it's like when Amnesty's Finland executive director said Israel was worse than any other country in the world, as a ""scum state"", which is absolutely atrocious considering more people have died in the past 5 years in Syria than died in 130 years of Arab-Zionist wars and fighting.

&gt;Maybe it's the fact that Amnesty hires ""researchers"" like [Saleh Hijazi, a Palestinian, to investigate Israel](http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/ideologues_or_experts_#Hijazi). Researchers who idolize terrorists like Leila Khaled and who support bloody intifadas.

&gt;The fact that you think Israel is committing so many violations, and that it's somehow not disproportionately focused on by Amnesty, is absurd. Go to Amnesty's website. I searched ""Israel"" in the report category and found [304 results](https://www.amnesty.org/en/search/?q=israel&amp;sort=relevance&amp;documentType=Report). Guess how many I found for **Saudi Arabia**?

&gt;[95](https://www.amnesty.org/en/search/?q=saudi+arabia&amp;sort=relevance&amp;documentType=Report).

&gt;Yeah, more reports on Israel than a country where women can't even fucking drive or walk unaccompanied by a man.

&gt;You really want to tell me there's no disproportionate focus and bias by Amnesty?

&gt;Really?

These numbers obviously are dependent on relevancy. Israelis want to pretend like every Palestinian that ever committed a crime was a state sanctioned terrorist. Your numbers are also not exactly ""proof"" of anything other than the fact that Israel is mentioned in 300 articles on a search engine. Why would Amnesty International focus on Saudi Arabia or Somalia? A authoritarian theocracy, that is most certainly not going to change, and a straight up failed state. No one is delusional enough to believe that either of these states are good, just beacons of democracy. On the other hand Apartheid Israel touts itself ""The only democracy of the Middle East"". A hypocritic and false narrative that must be shown for the propaganda it is. 

&gt;You should take a damn look at the numbers.

&gt;&gt; The reason that the UN estimates are closer to the Palestinian casualty count (Not the same number, therefore not ""using"" the Palestinian number) is because that is near what it actually is. 

&gt;No, it's because the UN gets all of its numbers from Palestinians. Who else are they asking? They have no connections to the Israeli intelligence forces that provide information to refute those claims, because Israel refuses to work with a UN panel that appoints people like William Schabas, a former [Palestinian government employee](http://www.wsj.com/articles/another-u-n-human-rights-fraud-1423180155), to investigate Israel.

Well that's odd because the UN numbers are different from the Palestinian numbers. They're in the middle with a skew towards the Palestinian side. Hardly a copy and paste from the Palestinian records. 

&gt;&gt; Israel would like the world to believe that all the women and children they killed were actually Hamas agents, which couldn't be further from the truth.

&gt;No, it wants to show the world that Hamas hid behind those women and children and that the women and children were inevitably killed because Israel can only do so much to save them.

&gt;Hamas acknowledged this strategy of using human shields, and [said that it is ""effective""](http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/4340.htm).

No they did not. Hamas never said that they used human shields. And the video that zionists try to use to say that is one of a speaker saying that it is good and brave for the Palestinians to stand up to the aggressor and to prevent their homes from being targeted, not a "" forced human shields."" I love when you people try to use this video to supported the erroneous and unfounded claim that Hamas users human shields. It's like you watched it and then pretended like the speaker said what your *wanted* him to say rather than paying attention to what he *actually* said. The only group in this conflict that has evidence supporting their use of human shields is Israel. 

&gt;There's really no doubt here. Israel knocked on roofs, dropped leaflets, phoned and texted homes, and more. It fired 29,000+ explosive shells and killed fewer than 2,200 people, half of whom were probably terrorists according to stats that use Israeli intelligence (and which tend to be more accurate). It took extreme care and called off numerous strikes when civilians were present in places it could see.

There's no where for the Palestinians to go. The Gaza strip is one of the most densely populated areas of the world. Those pamphlets are little more than a PR campaign and a sadistic jokes, and they certainly don't immediately make civilians military targets. The IDF destroyed more than 80,000 homes in the last war, and those were valid military targets? 

&gt;You want to claim there's no disproportionate focus and bias at Amnesty? Psh.

"In the case of real estate, I imagine that even if you immediately found a buyer the process of getting your money would still be slower than with other types of transactions.  Perhaps the local area requires a use/occupancy inspection before any sale, and they schedule those two weeks out, and so on.  

Though I guess you could negotiate an all-cash-up-front-we'll-sort-it-out-later deal for a low enough sale price.  That might also require buying insurance of some kind against the deal falling through, since there are probably numerous grounds for cancelling a real-estate sale that can't be waived by the buyer.

Obviously somebody who trades real-estate would know more than I (just a private homeowner), but there are a lot of legal protections around real estate since for most people they're huge financial transactions with a lot of things that can go wrong.",1

Since neither we nor our prisoners have free will, neither is morally responsible for the actions we take. So any moral objection to torture goes out the window since, having no free will, those objections simply do not apply. 

The problem with abandoning free will is that you have to abandon it not only for prisoners but for ourselves as well. If criminals are not responsible for their acts, neither are we in the punishment of those acts. Justification of our actions are irrelevant because we could not have acted otherwise.",1

"Copy pasta:

""I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside, and the practicality of that. It's about creating the feeling that everyone, everything is watching. A few points:

1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.

Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, and wow, the protest is huge. You never expected this, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person.

With this tech in place, the government doesn't have to put you in jail. They can do something more sinister. They can just email you a sexy picture you took with a girlfriend. Or they can email you a note saying that they can prove your dad is cheating on his taxes. Or they can threaten to get your dad fired. All you have to do, the email says, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.

2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, a movement springs up like occupy, except its bigger this time. People are really serious, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.

3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, you only heard screams. People begging to be killed. Noises you've never heard before. You, you were lucky. You got kicked every day when they threw your moldy food at you, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, and it was so overcrowded, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor, but he refuses to see you. He knows if he does the government can see the records that he treated you. Even you calling his office prompts a visit from the local police.

You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside, and he quickly tells you they were arrested three weeks ago and haven't been seen since. You vaguely remember mentioning to them on the phone you were going to that protest. Even your little brother isn't there.

4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him ""fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?""

""Sorry,"" he says. ""I just didn't know anyone read the news anymore."" There haven't been any real journalists for months. They're all in jail.

Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell, at one time YOU were reporting for the government. Maybe they just want their kid to get through school. Maybe they want to keep their job. Maybe they're sick and want to be able to visit the doctor. It's always a simple reason. Good people always do bad things for simple reasons.

You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist, and everyone around you might be reporting on you. You definitely can't use a phone or email. You can't get a job. You can't even trust people face to face anymore. On every corner, there are people with guns. They are as scared as you are. They just don't want to lose their jobs. They don't want to be labeled as traitors.

This all happened in the country where I live.

You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in, they also claimed it was for the safety of the people. Same in Soviet Russia. Same in East Germany. In fact, that is always the excuse that is used to surveil everyone. But it has never ONCE proven to be the reality.

Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or the one after him. Maybe this story isn't about you. Maybe it happens 10 or 20 years from now, when a big war is happening, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?

You know for me, the reason I'm upset is that I grew up in school saying the pledge of allegiance. I was taught that the United States meant ""liberty and justice for all."" You get older, you learn that in this country we define that phrase based on the constitution. That's what tells us what liberty is and what justice is. Well, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for? Safety?

Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above, does anyone sound safe?

I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen.

I actually get really upset when people say ""I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything."" People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive, and we need to listen to people in other countries who are clearly telling us that this is a horrible horrible sign and it is time to stand up and say no.""",109

What you're doing is telling a half truth. The whole paragraph seems to try to plant the idea that Shamir was awarded the prize for his militarism in the 40's. What you are not mentioning is the actual reason, which is clear from his work as PM:

&gt;During his term, Shamir reestablished diplomatic relations between Israel and several dozen African, Asian and other countries. In May 1991, as the Ethiopian government of Mengistu Haile Mariam was collapsing, Shamir ordered the airlifting of 14,000 Ethiopian Jews, known as Operation Solomon. He continued his efforts, begun in the late 1960s, to bring Soviet Jewish refugees to Israel. Shamir restored diplomatic relation between the Soviet Union and Israel in October 1991, and following its dissolution, established relations between Israel and his native Belarus in May 1992.[42] Shamir was dedicated to bringing Jews from all over the world to Israel, and called on American Jews to emigrate to Israel in spite of a higher standard of living in the US, saying that he expected even American Jewish youth to realize that ""man does not live by bread alone"" but to ""learn and understand Jewish history, the Bible... and reach the only conclusion: to come on aliya to Israel.""[43]",11

Is the fact that ISIS sells captured women in a meat market proof that they think of women as objects and acceptable slaves? Yes it does, because the existence of the action in the present proves the question.

Is the fact that Islamic terrorists blow up western civilians proof that Muslims are hostile to westerners (or at least what they perceive to be as western)? Yes it is, because there is not only one incident, but many actions to point to this.

But you cannot say that Europeans hate the world and think everyone should be enslaved, because that is clearly not true since they clearly abolished slavery and changed their societies. You cannot go to London or Paris and find a slave market. The question is disproved by their actions.",1

&gt; Turkey`s relations with fellow mainly Sunni Muslim power Saudi Arabia have warmed considerably in recent months.

&gt; As Turkish ties with Riyadh have warmed, Ankara`s relations with Tehran have grown more tense, notably over Iran`s role in Syria - where the Islamic republic supports Assad`s regime - and over its burgeoning relations with Russia.

"&gt;OK 1 billion catholics provide healthcare facilities for a quarter of 7 billion. Still punching above their weight.

So I looked up this stat and it comes directly from the church itself. That's not a reliable source and they provide absolutely no methodology to prove such a claim. 

&gt; But fact is atheists are less likely to donate, donate in smaller portions and are less likely to go to third world countries to help people, compared to religious people. 

That's really anecdotal evidence as donating to charity is not the only measure of being good. Furthermore, in one group you have a fear of eternal hellfire motivating you to donate, in the other group there is no similar motivation. 

&gt;You have to wonder why this is the case.

I think I just explained why, and in addition to that you have the fact that there are simply WAY more religious people than athiests and atheists are often disenfranchised with religion and many charity organizations are religious in nature so they might not want to donate while the converse, a religious person donating to a religious charity is practically doing 'double good' in their eyes. 


&gt;I personally disagree with you that religion is historically net bad and net bad today. 

Listen... if you wanna have a debate about net bad today, I'm happy to do that. But I refuse to even entertain the idea that historically the good outweighs the bad. 

&gt;In my personal experience religious people are the nicest etc...

anecdote. Nothing but anecdote. In my experience most religious people are motivated by selfish interests, the desire to go to heaven.

&gt;Take the last 200 years when religion was less of an influence, Hitler, Stalin, Mao committing atrocities on unimaginable scales.

Hitler's followers were religious in their devotion and it very much took on religious elements. It simply wasn't a mainstream religion. Stalin and Mao are indeed arguments that secular people can be violent too, and no one is arguing otherwise... we're just trying to say there's no good religion can do that you can't do without it... but there's lots of BAD it can do that *cannot* be done without it. For example, without a hell motivating you, in a religion free world there's nothing to replace that. There's no afterlife you have to be afraid of to listen to your religion.

I really don't think your teacher was correct at all. I think that religion has done horrible things and allowed even more horrible things to happen. The catholic church was complicit with the italian fascist government! They were complicit in the holocaust, for christ's sake! IF the church were truly this force of good that they claimed to be, why didn't the pope put his life on the line in 1940 when jews were being exterminated and condemn it? Riiiight... because he wanted to hold onto his power and influence. 

The arab conquests, the crusades, the conquistadors, the moores, the reconquistadors, the imperial british... you could write 10,000 books about the death and destruction caused directly by religion or motivated directly by religious text and religious leaders in history. You could write another 10,000 books about how the catholic church set back the progress of science by 900 years by imprisoning Galileo. 900 years. That's how long it was before the theories he set forward were re-discovered and properly proven. Imagine how different the world would be if the church didnt take that 900 years of scientific progress away from the world. And that's ON TOP of all the killing and death and destruction.   

&gt; My argument would be that it is largely religious people who are dragging the world out of poverty and that if they weren't there it would take much longer than it already is.

Inflation has been nil. If we take away oil then it would be around 2%, which is perfectly healthy. A few years ago everyone talking about this was scaremongering about peak oil. What happened to that? 

There is way too much student loan debt but there is no true bubble except perhaps a law school bubble. Credit card debt is below it was 2007 despite the crisis and the low oil prices are causing that extra income to be used towards paying down debt instead of consumer spending. Housing?

"North Korea is a Juche Communist country where housing + healthcare + basic amenities are provided by the government, in theory.  North Korea was heavily reliant on Soviet aid which dried up when the USSR disbanded and led to famine and mass starvation in North Korea in the 90s.  

So, if unification did happen or the regime collapsed in the North due to some sort of internal revolution or coup, that's 25 million people no longer being cared for by their government that would have to be cared for or there would be a massive humanitarian crisis.  On top of that, the education they all receive is more akin to state brainwashing so most of them are unfit for anything besides menial labor jobs in factories or farms.  Not only would South Korea/China/USA/Japan/Russia/India (to a differentiated degree) have to feed and shelter and educate these people, the infrastructure in the entire country has to be built up and that is going to cost trillions of dollars and take years.  

None of the major international players want the status quo to change, with the exception of maybe the USA.  China would lose its communist buffer state between itself and it's rivals.  Japan would fear the regional power of a United Korea.  South Korea doesn't want to pay for it.  The USA would have trouble justifying all of its military bases and arms sold in the region if the N.

"&gt; It is easier to throw people in 3 or 4 somewhat arbitrary categories than to figure out the genetic makeup of every single individual.

It is more efficient, if a population is relatively stable, then 3 or 4 categories is all you need. 

For example, for clinical trial purposes in the U.S. we look at NativeAmericsns/Asians/Blacks/PacificIslanders/Whites separately. And yeah, ""Black"" here means of predominantly west-African and european (20%, iirc) ancestry, genetically speaking. And ""white"" means european or middle-eastern. If you don't look at those categories separately, you are going to run into troubles with beta blockers or antihypertensive agents. 

So yeah, going back to our discussion, those (genetic) categories are geographic ( in the sense of what continent your ancestors came from) in nature, and they are pretty meaningful.

"Because if they arrest them, they generate a record of them, they've effectively registered them as present in their country which obligates them to process them accordingly in compliance with relevant laws.

At best they'd need to be processed through the justice system and by the time that happens they might have had their status as non-French people clarified in terms of whether they can be deported.  

All that costs money.  Probably though, their status in terms of whether they can be legally deported and where to in many cases wouldn't be resolved by the time the justice system finishes with their prosecution for the crime they've been arrested for.

Apparently they're in Calais for the most part because they'd rather go to the UK than stay on the Continent, and since the French government would apparently rather not bother going to the trouble of processing them all at great expense, they do nothing.  Every one that slips away is one less to deal with if they ever get around to doing anything.

It's cheaper and easier to do nothing than to do something, and for every one that slips into the UK, that's one less they  have to deal with at all.  So they've not being doing anything and they probably won't be doing anything until elected politicians find it's more politically expensive than expose's about the cost and legal implications of doing something.

It's worth noting that a lot of these people, if they were officially recorded as present can't be immediately deported out of the country even if there are no chargings pending against them in the justice system.  They have to have their nation of origin established for instance and if they don't cooperate that can be difficult; they can make claims that then have to be processed even if baseless (due process is used to distinguish baseless claims from those with substance and that costs money and takes time).

If the government did something it's likely to be expensive in terms of money and have a high political cost, for instance if they follow the law it's likely to entail granting a lot of these people at least temporary residency while they are processed with every step having administrative overhead costs.  Imagine the headlines: 50 gazallion dollar tax payer initiative sees Calais trouble makers granted residency in PC madness gone mad!

So until the crisis reaches a tipping point where the cost of doing nothing becomes entirely insupportable to elected politicians, ""best practice"" in terms of cover-your-ass political-expediency is to do nothing at all.",851

1) Criminals don't care about laws and there will always be a black market for those who want to kill.

2) Mental health treatment (or lack thereof) would be a better place to start combating this problem.

3) What kind of example in leadership do we have when America is constantly at war, selling arms to questionable countries and ""rebels"", and the CIA is (and has for decades) running illegal guns trading and arming terrorists used against innocent civilians?

4) It gets sticky when you have the NSA spying on all citizens and a government and health institution that is corrupt making the rules.

"&gt; Who did it in the name of a religion

Out of curiosity, are you an atheist/agnostic or a hypocrite?

&gt; Most Germans were unaware of most of what Hitler and the Nazis were doing, they were born Germans. Muslims choose to be Muslim and practice their cult.

Try reading a book sometime. This one for instance: https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/up-in-smoke-goes-the-lie-that-the-holocaust-was-a-big-secret/203103.article

I don't care what they were born as, in the late 30s at the latest they had to choose between being German or being good people.

&gt; It's not even remotely close.

Indeed, Muslims aren't united under the same more or less elected government like Germans were.

Do you see Christians who set fire to abortion clinics also as just coming to the logical conclusion of reading the Bible?

&gt; So now you don't believe in basic psychological concepts?

I don't believe in sweeping generalizations that focus on one aspect while ignoring vast stretches of a highly complex reality in order to promote a narrative, something which you seem to like just as much as Islamists btw. ;)

&gt; Do you ""not see race"" and believe gender is a social construct?

Since I am a communist and not a liberal I do in fact see race, and the role it plays in society. It and gender are both social constructs.

&gt; The last thousands of years and even millions of years were filled with senseless murder, greed, war and tribalism. It's never gonna change, even if humans became extinct you would see it in nature.

How could there be murder in nature? Judging by your use of the term ""hippy shit"" and literally everything else you wrote you don't strike me as one of the ""meat/fur is murder!"" people, and even those people overall seem to idealize nature and only call it murder when it's done by humans. The same goes for greed which only makes sense for maybe the most highly developed animals like monkeys or dolphins. War is definitely an exclusively human phenomenon because no other animal that we know organizes in states, and tribalism, eh, I guess maybe.

&gt; They will always want to kill you unless you join their cult.

Or I could put them in a Gulag and brainwash/educate them until they renounce their beliefs. There weren't many violent cults in the Soviet Union, and I think even the Scandinavian prison model would do a good enough job for all but the most die hard fanatics.

Also wait a friggin' minute, if violent cults were part of human nature, which is supposedly unchangeable and something every human shares by definition, wouldn't that mean every single human being should always be in a violent cult?

&gt; AMSTERDAM European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has warned that a Dutch advisory referendum in April on the bloc&amp;#039;s association agreement with Ukraine could lead to a &amp;quot;Continental crisis&amp;quot; if voters reject the treaty.

&gt; In an interview published on Saturday by the Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad, Juncker said Russia would &amp;quot;Pluck the fruits&amp;quot; of a vote in the Netherlands against deepened ties between the European Union and Ukraine.

&gt; The website admitted that its reasons for seeking the referendum, to be held during the current Dutch presidency of the bloc, had less to do with its views on the EU&amp;#039;s ties with Ukraine than with its desire for a vote on the bloc itself.

In NZ's case we have a ""Constitution Act"" but it simply confirms that the NZ Parliament has full power to pass any law by a majority (and its power isn't limited by our other more important Acts (such as the Bill of Rights Act). There is one section in the Electoral Act that stipulates that a super-majority in Parliament is needed to alter certain voting-related things, but technically Parliament could simply repeal that section with a simple majority and the section would be gone. 
Even our Judges aren't allowed to strike down laws because they think they are inconsistent with important laws like the Bill of Rights Act or the Privacy Act or any other Act. 

There is a collection of statutes, court judgments and conventions that are generally agreed to be part of the constitution, although they aren't written down into one document. Perhaps Judges would rebel and refuse to obey a law they viewed as contrary to fundamental aspects of the NZ constitution/tradition &amp; UK common law tradition. (i.e. one famous NZ Judge has said that some common law rights would ""presumably lie so deep that even Parliament could not override them"" (in the context of whether Parliament could pass a law allowing torture for instance).

"Short answer: Cubans vote Republican.

Slightly more detailed answer: To qualify for asylum you can't just be fleeing poverty or corruption or even a general high violent crime rate, it has to be political persecution. Mexico is a poor shithole with an absent government but it is not an authoritarian single party dictatorship like Cuba. 

Cuba has a population about 1/10th of Mexico's so Americans don't need to feel worried about being ""swamped"" by them. 

Cuba also has a complicated history as a former US territory which gives the government more of a moral and political incentive to accept those who would already be US citizens if history had worked out just a tiny bit differently. 

And finally they make up a very strong, reliable Republican voting bloc, unique among Latin Americans in the US, which diffuses a lot of the possible controversy about their unconditional right to asylum in the US. ",-6

&gt;we've already set up the comparison is about countries that exist at the same time 

you are taking your own argument ad absurdum. you said islam was progressive because it granted tolerance (albeit as second class citizens never save from persecution) to people of the book. conversely, they brutalised people not under that status (example here: india) viciously and genocidally. so where is this progressive face of islam? the early christian communities were far more progressive as to tolerance and non violence and that was centuries before. also lets not forget that your progressive tolerance was ""awarded"" to people conquered by religious warfare.

&gt; Steve Warren, spokesman for the international coalition bombing Islamic State, rejected the media reports this week, calling them &amp;quot;Iranian disinformation&amp;quot; aimed at distracting from Iraqi military gains against Islamic State elsewhere.

&gt; The government has designated Mosul as the next target for Iraq&amp;#039;s armed forces after they retook the western city of Ramadi last month, the first major success of the U.S.-trained force that initially fled in the face of Islamic State&amp;#039;s advance.

"&gt; I'm saying they outlined their beliefs and socialists but when they achieved power that turned out to be a lie and they simply controlled the people through a central command and totalitarian dictatorship.

It always turns out to be a lie.

If you support the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, you support dictatorship.

&gt;even the no true scotsman fallacy is used purely so the people in charge (i.e. capitalists) can make their own definitions for whatever suits them best.

No, claiming that the USSR and China were not communist or socialist is frankly absurd.  The proof is in the pudding and the two largest communist dictatorships, one of which still holds over a billion people under its shockingly brutal heel, define the terms far better than your naive, misguided idealism ever could.  I will also not be splitting terminological hairs about murderous dictators, I won't do them the courtesy.

Look at the way SJWs behave when they achieve even a tiny pittance of power.

"&gt; All the way back in 2011, one of Craig Patty’s two trucks was in the shop for repairs, or so he thought. In fact, the Drug Enforcement Agency was using the truck and it’s driver to haul a load of marijuana north from the Rio Grande Valley as part of a sting operation targeting the Los Zetas cartel.

&gt; Unfortunately, as the truck passed Houston, it was ambushed by cartel members and despite the fact that he was being shadowed by two dozen federal agents and local police, the driver was killed when the truck was shot full of bullets.

*Botched?!* This is a total fuck-up. 

&gt; After the incident, the truck was ruined and needed repairs. The insurance company refused to pay for it since it had been used in a criminal act (hauling the marijuana), and the DEA refused to pay for it simply because they didn’t have to.

Okay, I can see where the insurance company's coming from, but for fuck's sake, it's not right that the DEA doesn't pay out. 

&gt; Since 2011, Patty has been fighting to make the DEA pay him the money he feels he is owed. His is currently fighting for $133,532 in repairs and lost wages for the time the truck wasn’t able to be used, and $1.3 million in damages to himself and his family who have lived in fear of retaliation by the cartels since the incident.

&gt; Now a judge has ruled that the DEA doesn’t have to pay him back because it doesn’t have a rule against doing what it did. Despite the fact that the DEA wiped away the driver’s substantial criminal record so that he would be hired, despite the fact that they used the driver and equipment for illegal activities, despite the fact that they never asked permission or told the company owner anything about what was happening until after the incident, and despite the fact that a man died as a result of their botched operation, the DEA still hasn’t legally done anything wrong. So they don’t have to pay.

Wonderful! 

&gt; From here, Patty plans to appeal the ruling in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. His attorneys will have a total of 20 minutes to plead his case. If he loses there, his last possible option will be a hearing in the U.S. Supreme Court.

In other words: barring a really amazing stroke of good luck where his attorneys match up with a proper judge, this man's not likely to get paid. ",7

First, many of these migrants have no papers or fake ones.  They cannot be positively identified so we don't know *where* to send them back *to*.  

*Send them back to the country they entered from!*  

Sorry, but those countries won't accept 1,000,000 undocumented immigrants, some of which are potentially dangerous.  If you were an Eastern European country with less wealth and less ability to cope with these migrants, would you?   

*Well, then lets just round them all up and put them in camps!*

I hate to break it to you, but it's neither cheap nor easy to set up a refugee camp that would pass western standards in terms of hygiene and security.  What's more, no one will want the camp near their home.  Could your government convince you to allow them to build a camp for hundreds of thousands of undocumented people next door to you?    

Finally, how about the families that genuinely *do* need a place to go and are not merely looking for easy money, easy women, and an easy life?  Can you conscionably send those families to their deaths?  

*You* might be able to, but your government can't because they would never hear the end of it from China, Russia, North Korea, and every other country who defends their piss-poor human rights record by pointing out *yours*.

The throat is slit while the animal is alive because the sky fairy of halal certification says blood loss must be the cause of death. It is not like they kill it by stun bolt then bleed it after. Even where they modify the practice to use a temporary stunner those are tested to ensure an animal stunned will regain consciousness - to make sure it is the throat cutting that causes death.

I think this is barbaric and i do not want that on my meat.

I am not religious. I do not believe in sky fairies and i do not want my meat consecrated to a god i do not believe in and do not like.

"&gt; Have you experience with ADHD? 

I've seen endless kids accused of ADHD &amp; have seen zero evidence of any illness.  Paying attention to fun/interesting things &amp; not boring mind-killing school work is not an illness.

&gt; How do you know kids are being forcefully drugged? 

First, practically all drugging of kids with Ritalin could be considered forceful/coerced because it's based on fraudulent information.

But as for (eg) kidnapping/beating/suffocation druggings I'm not sure how rare those are.

But the simple fact is that's how psychiatrists operate.  If they ""diagnose"" someone &amp; ""prescribe"" a drug the person who refuses can be kidnapped &amp; forcefully drugged.

Psychiatrists do not even deny they forcefully drug people.  eg [as mentioned by the WSJ.](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB113876185080261746)

 - ""Every other week, Jeff Demann drives to a clinic in rural Michigan, drops his pants and gets a shot of an antipsychotic drug that he says makes him sick.

  If I don't show up, the cops show up at my door step and I wind up in a mental ward""

-- http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB113876185080261746

Similarly:    

 - ""In psychiatric hospitals, the forced medication of patients involves physically restraining them (straight jackets, wrist straps, etc.) or, in some case, physically beating the patient until they agree to take their pills. If a patient refuses to open their mouth to take the pills, mental hospital workers may hold the patient down, then hold their nose, forcing them to either open their mouth or suffocate. Once the mouth is open, **they physically force the medications down their throat**

&gt;  No one forces it down their throats.

That's not true.  See the bold above.

&gt; those who have schizophrenia

**The Guardian:**   

- ""The British Psychological Society released a statement claiming that there is no scientific validity to diagnostic labels such as schizophrenia""     

http://guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2013/may/20/mental-illnesses-depression-pms-culturally-determined    

**NY TIMES:**

 - ""[BPS]... released a remarkable document entitled “Understanding Psychosis and Schizophrenia.” Its authors say that hearing voices and feeling paranoid are common experiences, and are often a reaction to trauma, abuse or deprivation: “Calling them symptoms of mental illness, psychosis or schizophrenia is only one way of thinking about them, with advantages and disadvantages.”   

  The report says that there is no strict dividing line between psychosis and normal experience: “Some people find it useful to think of themselves as having an illness. Others prefer to think of their problems as, for example, an aspect of their personality which sometimes gets them into trouble but which they would not want to be without.”     

  The report adds that antipsychotic medications are sometimes helpful, but that “there is no evidence that it corrects an underlying biological abnormality.” It then warns about the risk of taking these drugs for years.    

-- http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/opinion/sunday/t-m-luhrmann-redefining-mental-illness.html

I'm not saying that ""sensory errors"" are a myth.  Anyone can (eg) think they feel a bug, bug bite, etc and look to discover nothing.  Some people could have visual/etc errors. These could be called sensory errors, or far more cruel &amp; dehumanizing language (eg ""hallucinations"").  It's language invented by the psychiatric &amp; drug industries.  (Words like ""hallucinations"" are made up by giant industries like pharmaceuticals &amp; psychiatry itself, not the public.)  

And it's very often a gross &amp; cruel exaggeration which the people accused did not invent.  (But would very regularly deny if they realized their psychiatrist accused them of ""delusions"" &amp; ""hallucinations."")

Interest does not create dollars. Dollars are ""created"" when the government prints more bills, but it doing so it lowers the value of all already circulating dollars. When a bank gives you dollars in the form of interest from a savings account, what it's doing is investing your saved dollars elsewhere, then giving you a (small) cut of the profits from the investment.

Dollars don't vanish, unless somebody goes out and burns some bills or something. What can happen is the value of a dollar going up or down, from inflation or deflation. But excluding any dollars being printed or destroyed, the amount of money in total remains constant. Its just the amount of goods you can buy with your dollars changes.

The United States *still* have yet to stop actively supply a bloody rebel insurgency with everything from firearms to antitank weaponry, as they have been since Arab Spring in 2011. 

Nothing pisses me off more than how few Americans are even aware of this, primarily because the state of Ameircan media is nothing short of deplorable. 

Like, imagine for a moment that in the middle of the Brooklyn Riots, or the Ferguson riots, or the Baltimore riots, some of the most deliberately violent groups of participants imaginable started receiving shipments of claymores, RPGs, and automatic rifles from the UK by the crate?  If those armed rioters then went on to actually capture military vehicles and facilities for their own, and actually managed to piece together a fighting force genuinely powerful enough to make advances on the United States Military?
All this, while the English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh populace had no idea why they were even involved in military action against the States, if they were even aware of it at all?


Because I'll tell you right now, an entirely implausible scenario like that? It's not even *half* as bad as what the reality is over there right now, *and yet the weapons keep being sent*. 

It's not even a fucking campaign issue in the States right now!

You are simply not reading the statistics correctly. This is first off all, number of convicted cases. Which is a whole host of issues with it in itself if you want to compate it with other nations. Like, Sweden might be much better at reporting these cases, or that they are more actively seeking them out, etc. Secondly these are not ""all rapes"" or ""våldtäkt"" which is a much wider definition. The statistics you are referring to is what amounts to aggravated sexual assault. Which I believe amounts to ""Våld og våldtäkt av en person i särskilt utsatt situation"".

"In this case, ""mitigating circumstances"" includes the culture clash, though, just like we consider the background and circumstances of (for example) a man accused of robbery... because he is desperate to feed his children.

The justice system must be concerned first and foremost with the case at hand.  The repercussions on other cases must be considered second, because the people in *this* case deserve to be treated fairly and justly based on the merits of *THIS* case.  (That may mean *harsher* sentencing for some, but I digress.)

And ""the merits of *this* case"" can only be taken into account by judges and juries of *people*, who are the only ones who can really evaluate the *people* on trial.  The system as intended allows for the human element and the ""gut feeling"" one gets about whether the accused person ""just fucked up,"" or is truly a Bad Person.

It is in this context that culture clash should be considered.  For some, it's an excuse and they will try to do better.  For others, it's a dodge so they can get out of punishment.  It has to be up to the judge to figure that out.

If we take that sort of discretion away from the judges, you get messes like [California's ""Three Strikes"" law](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/02/released-3-strike-convicts-stay-out-prison).

Note that the article shows that reforming ""three strikes"" hasn't been simple, either.

In states like North Dakota I'm sure it's worse than average, but in general, the US shale industry is a very tiny section of the US economy. All the other sectors, as well as private individuals, benefit from lower oil prices. 

&gt;always two sides to the coin but if it was any other ""non-allied"" State increasing production to decrease the value of oil we would be giving them some freedom right about now.

Actually, I can't remember a time when the US or the West wanted expensive oil. So I doubt anything would happen if Iran decided to up it's production. It would be welcomed by the US, Europe, China, and India.

sati didn't happen the way british did.  
nobody murdered women in droves and blamed it on religion.

not just hinduism but any dharmic/indian or even non-indian faith that is in line with indian views of live and let live.  
because as we've already discussed, hinduism is india's culture.  
&gt;Because, like I have proven, Muslims still eat (halal is not a type of food. It's still the same dishes, hundreds of millions of Hindus are not vegeterians, including Kshatriyas who eat more meat than Muslims) 

no need to lie again.  
no one ever said halal was a type of food, it is a type of preparation and it is uniquely muslim.  
you can try to spin it anyway you want but it is different.  
also, i never said all indians were vegetarian or that vegetarianism defined india.  
simply that the eating habits differ from that of indians.  

&gt;ncluding Kshatriyas who eat more meat than Muslims

citation please.

how dare they just avoid it by reject caste system and how dare you lie again by claiming that caste doesn't exist in muslims who live in india.

100 years ago through the beginning of time - girls were married off the minute they bled.  Why?  Because at that point you have reached sexual maturity.  

Why our country decided to tack an arbitrary number on top of that is beyond me.  Most places age of consent is lower, some by a lot.  Even drinking in the states is the oldest anywhere in the world.

If your sexually mature, your not a pedophile IMO.  Otherwise you most certainly need psychiatric help (not prison.  Sexual urges aren't criminal or able to be helped).

Perhaps I'm wrong, but I feel that holding classes like this would be a must to not only introduce them to the country and its practices, but use them as a way to hopefully identify the unsavory minority that have no desire to adapt to their new home country's culture and feel that behavior such as this is acceptable.

"Well, I mean 'you heard they are one of the good guys' so it must be true. There must be no ulterior motives with Gates at all, he's a stand up guy. It's not like he formed a monopoly to earn his billions and his company found guilty of Antitrust because of their illegal actions.

Just like Warren Buffet makes his kids earn their fair share:

&gt;The Oracle of Omaha isn't worried about his children not getting their fair share. Echoing a common sentiment on this list, Buffett said in his letter to the Gates Foundation: ""I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing.""

Except he gave his son 1 billion endowment for his foundation. 

http://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-tycoons-who-won-t-leave-their-fortunes-to-their-kids-195610442.html

And that is why you think Gates is one of the good guys. Cause the media spins stupid bullshit stories to make you feel good about yourself and the world you live in.

Back to the Gates foundation though... This is from the wiki, its just to point out that they are aware of the criticisms but did not act on it:


&gt;The foundation trust invests undistributed assets, with the exclusive goal of maximizing the return on investment. As a result, its investments include companies that have been criticized for worsening poverty in the same developing countries where the foundation is attempting to relieve poverty.[35][37] These include companies that pollute heavily and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.[38] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced in 2007 a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[39] It subsequently cancelled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[40][41]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation


Here was a campaign by 250,000 people who called on Gates to stop investing in Exxon:

&gt;The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world’s wealthiest charitable foundation, has been under an unprecedented amount of scrutiny regarding their investments in the fossil fuel industry lately.

&gt;Alongside a persistent and growing local Seattle-based campaign, about a quarter of a million people joined the Guardian in calling on the Foundation to join the $2.6 trillion worth of investors who have committed to divest from fossil fuels.

&gt;In response, Bill Gates has proffered two public rejections of fossil fuel divestment, the most recent in a lengthy interview on climate change in this month’s edition of the Atlantic. Both rejections were based on misleading accounts of divestment which created straw men of the divestment movement, and downplayed the remarkable prospects for a clean energy revolution.


http://www.salon.com/2015/11/07/bill_gates_gives_exxon_cover_the_gates_foundation_is_deadly_wrong_on_climate_change_fossil_fuels/

[Here's a list of companies the Gates foundation was invested in, in 2012](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/12/gates-foundations-24-most-egregious-investments) You can look up their holdings at any time, they have moved out of Oil, but I think thats because it isn't the same play right now as it was a few years ago, nothing to do with morality.

Exxon has a long history in South America and Africa. You can find more articles pointing out the irony, but I can be bothered to search f or them now.

Here is more on Agra in Africa though, something Gates is tied to closely, but not in the way some would like:

&gt;Since 2006, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has funded the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) to the tune of almost $420 million. Activists from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, and Ethiopia recently attended the US-Africa Food Sovereignty Strategy Summit in Seattle to argue that the Foundation’s strategy for agriculture in Africa is a flawed attempt to impose industrial agriculture at the expense of more ecologically sound approaches.

&gt;Daniel Maingi works with small farmers in Kenya and belongs to the organization Growth Partners for Africa. The Seattle Times reported him as saying that while the goal of helping African farmers is laudable, the ‘green revolution’ approach is based on Western-style agriculture, with its reliance on fertilizer, weed killers and single crops, such as corn [1].

&gt;Growth Partners Africa works with farmers to enrich the soil with manure and other organic material, to use less water and to grow a variety of crops, including some that would be considered weeds on an industrial farm. For Maingi, food sovereignty in Africa means reverting back to a way of farming and eating that pre-dates major investment from the West.

&gt;Mariam Mayet of the African Centre for Biosafety in South Africa says that many countries are subsidizing farmers to buy fertilizer as part of the chemical-industrial model of  agriculture, but that takes money away from public crop-breeding programmes that provide improved seeds to farmers at low cost.

&gt;Elizabeth Mpofu, of La Via Campesina, grows a variety of crops in Zimbabwe. During a recent drought, neighbours who relied on chemical fertilizer lost most of their crops.

&gt;He added that what AGRA is doing is “out of sync with the natural process” by bringing in imported seeds, which are not adapted to the land and require excessive fertilizer and pesticides.


&gt;AGRA is part of a global trend that is being driven by big agritech that seeks to eradicate the small farmer and undermine local economies and food sovereignty by subjecting countries to the vagaries of rigged global markets [5,6].

&gt;Giant agritech corporations like Monsanto with their patented seeds and associated chemical inputs are working to ensure a shift away from diversified agriculture that guarantees balanced local food production, the protection of people’s livelihoods and environmental sustainability.

&gt;These two entities are not just linked together through their involvement in Agra. The Gates Foundation has substantial shares in Monsanto [14]. With Monsanto’s active backing from the US State Department [15] and the Gates Foundation’s links with USAID [16], together they comprise a formidable geopolitical strategic force.

EDIT: I dont think the answer for the Netherlands is to deport all refugees. Our demographic build-up isnt stable enough to sustain a proper economy in 20 years, we need new laborers or we wont be able to support the current luxury we have. We simply have too many people growing old and too low birth rates. However, building centers to receive them, giving them €250 a month, nothing to do and 10 people per m2 is a horrible idea. If we truly want to take in refugees, send them to work. Make them do simple tasks no one wantrouwend until they receive their permit. Work for it, one crime means deportation. More focus on integration and our equality culture. Thus, more than just one 'inburgeringscursus'. It will cost money, but it will earn money and stability in the long run. And we're not spending that much at the moment anyway.

"By law, a land can only be sold or leased to any non-foreign person.  
Foreign is defined as such:  

* Anyone who isn't either a resident or citizen of Israel, or eligible to citizenship according the Law of Return.  
* A corporation controlled by one or more of the above.  
* Anyone acting in the name of one of the above.  

Permission to sell/lease land to a foreigner is given by the Israel Lands Council, who will take into consideration the following:  

* The public's interest and safety  
* The affinity of the foreigner to Israel, including his personal details, the length of residency in Israel, and family relation to any non-foreigner  
* The reason for which the foreigner asks the land to be sold/given to them  
* How many lands were sold to the foreigner before hence  
* The properties of the land, including size, location and allocated purpose.  

Since West Bank/East Jerusalem/Gaza Palestinians do not hold permanent residency/citizenship in Israel, they are considered foreigners per the above for any land within the green line. 

If a Palestinian holds an Israeli citizenship/residency, there are no limitations on selling land to them.  

You will not, however, find any penalty or punishment for trying to sell to a foreigner. The authorities simply won't approve it.

As for the part you bolded, I never denied that, and it in fact supports my point. There are [over 4 million refugees living in countries outside of the war zone.](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php) Take a look at that website and you will see there are (negligibly) more women then men, and also lots of children. The problem comes then, when [from this sample of over 1,000,000 arrivals by sea, most are men, and not even close to all of them are from Syria/are refugees.](http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php)^(The Greece sample size is the number which peaked at 220,000 in October, over 100k for 5 months) Go down to the documents, click data and statistics, click the PDF download ""Men Women and Children - trends of arrivals to Greece June - 16 Jan 2016"" and see the last 6 months of these statistics. Hundreds of thousands are coming into western Europe from all sorts of middle eastern countries, and they are not refugees at this point, but immigrants. And these immigrants are mostly men, statistically speaking, with sources. Keep in mind, this is the UN Refugee Agency, not some guy paid off by Donald Trump. If you look at these statistics, they show that most (a clear majority, this is not me making a sweeping statement, go look at the numbers)(~60% for Syria and ~90% for Pakistan and Iran) are above the age of 18, and also most are men.

So the problem that everyone has is that these are not just refugees entering the west, and it's not a balanced number of who you think should be coming. The data actually shows that the Syrians coming through Greece are the most balanced group (still not equal, mind you) men:women:children wise, but they don't make up the entirety of the group. This is why they are being called ""economic immigrants"" or whatever the phrase is, because many of the people (mostly men) coming to Europe are not in dire straits, or from Syria. Their lives would stop being in danger in Turkey and Lebanon, which is where they would be refugees, and where millions of refugees are. These migrants going into Europe are not refugees anymore, and many of them never were to begin with.

I encounter this logic among Palestine supporters all the time, they don't really care about what's best for Palestinians, they just want to hurt Israel, that's why some people defend Hamas.

On both sides I think that this is very destructive. There is no reason for you to not differentiate between the PA and Hamas. The occupation and settlements in the PA territory is causing immense suffering in Palestine and inspires violence against Israelis. We should be doing everything we can to limit violence, and that means coming up with a way to help the PA control its people. They have slowly lost control over their territory the longer this occupation continues. If a peace deal had been made in 2005 then I am absolutely certain that there would be no Hamas takeover of Gaza in 2007. The PA would have had more popular support and economic/institutional/military strength required to defeat Hamas. It was only because the Palestinians perceived the PA to be weak and ineffective that they supported Hamas enough to give them an opening to overthrow the PA in Gaza.


If we can reach a deal between the PA and Israel it will prove to Palestine that peace works and that Hamas is only causing destruction to Palestine. Right now Hamas looks strong because they are violent and independent while the peaceful PA is occupied and settled. This tells Palestine that the only way to get free of occupation is to use violent uprisings. We need to stop this and show that negotiations work and can improve conditions for Palestinians. ",1

It's either that, or you don't grant them the rights and privileges of a UK citizen, in which case you're literally creating a sub-class, which again, you will need to deal with, because they won't have much money, will be mostly unemployed, and the combination of those two things breeds crime in *any* demographic.

Just arguing that they're human beings and that they want something better is not a reason for opening our doors, if anything, it's an argument against it.

To give you an example of how funds originate from Saudi, funds go out to a John Doe in Paris, then that John Doe send it to another John Doe in Malaysia and the funds keep going around the world until it reaches ISIS, there is no way you can predict where the funds will end up from the point of origin which is Saudi Arabia.

Why would they purposely craft a deal that does not direct benefit them, and thereby violate their existing prerogatives to increase profits over any other factor? That is the basis of economics, is it not? The assumption that people behave rationally to maximize profits?

"Supply-side economics is the theory that greater purchasing power is achieved by producing more goods and services, and that the best way to achieve this is through capital reinvestment in production rather than consumption.

The best way to produce more stuff is to put more money into machines, factories, etc. that produce it.

Trickle down theory is the populist idea that government in the '80s cut taxes for wealthy people so that they would consume more, boosting demand of the services of less wealthy people, who then consume more goods and services from even less wealthy people, etc. 

It's a strawman argument because no economic school of thought ever advocated it: the supply-side economists don't argue that wealthy people consume more stuff, they argue that wealthy people reinvest most of their capital into their business, therefore lowering the price of the products they output, which benefits all consumers.
