"I was playing Black Ops 3 one night. Did pretty well so these two guys invited me to play and their party chat. After a few games I think one guys voice is familiar; brush it off as a coincidence. Then the guys friend said the guys name. So I asked him if he was blank that used to work at blank? Yeah....why? It's me, 98Saturn, I trained you in my department before you were fired. Didn't know he had an xb1 let alone his gamertag. 

Another one was I was rear ended in a town about 40 miles away from my home town. I was shot into oncoming traffic and a big red dodge 3500 swerved to miss me. Few days later I'm telling my buddy's dad about the crash. About half way through my story he stops me and asks if a red dodge missed me, and then told me that his friend was driving that truck. I told him to thank him for not being on his phone because if he hadn't been paying attention and didn't swerve, I would have been hit head on by a truck pulling a horse trailer. I know he would've killed me had he not swerved. Thank you for not being on your phone, guy. ",1

"A few weeks ago I got food poisoning. The catch was it didn't hit until I was an hour into a 6 hour drive in freezing temperatures. Luckily I was a passenger, but it was a truly intense and miserable six hours of puking, shaking, sweating and shivering. At one point I was in the back seat and it looked like I had just gone swimming. DRENCHED from head to toe, dripping sweat. Then my hands started shaking, violently and uncontrollably. Then the tingles started. This was the weirdest feeling. Like my limbs were ""waking up"" even though they never fell asleep. Just intense, Funny tingling all over my arms and legs. I thought I was going to have a hearty attack and die, it was terrifying, but even at the time deep in my mind I was fascinated. How could my body just create all these sensations out of nowhere against my will?  Amazing. ",1

They don't give a crap about Hannity or Maddow, Jeb, Graham, Hillary, Sanders, Trump or any of the other canidates. The closest they come to following politics is to watch The Daily Show, or something similar. A lot of them dislike Trump, but some don't. That, how ever matters little because everyone can agree that politicians are shit and decide to stay home, not vote and say ""fuck it"". And that way anyone can en up being nominated, especially if they can just surf on peoples discontent.

Why is it that Trump can infact insult himself to the white house? Because when we hold him up to the standard that has become ""politician"", it's shit anyway. ",2

The real reason to have one is to help build a credit history. Don't treat it like free money (it's not) and be sure to pay it off every month (unless you have a large single purchase to make, like furniture, and want to use the ability to pay it off over 2-3 months -just remember you will pay interest on the remainder if you do this.

"I guess seeing a guy jump in front of a train right in front of me, seeing his body getting wrapped around the wheels of the train, with other parts of his remains being thrown in the trees next to the track, dangling bits in what I usually describe as a red Christmas tree of gore.   
  
Up until then I guess I never gave it much thought, but bodies aren't like in video games, where there's a little arm here, a torso there. No, we're straight up gooey blood balloons. The worst part was that I wasn't allowed to leave because I had to give testimony (and to rule out I didn't push him, which I didn't know until months later). I pretty much had to watch the local fire brigade clean up the mess, with the most vivid moment being one of the firemen putting his head into a bag that another fireman was holding, as if it was just another piece of trash after someone had a wild party or something.  
  
The whole thing didn't really traumatize me, but I did walk around for a year thinking it should have traumatized me. It actually happened a 2nd time at the same train station, but since I was on a different track that day I had the fortune of just hearing other people scream over it and not actually witness the moment. I later learned that that specific trainstation was the #2 trainstation for suicides in my country. Apparently someone had the bright idea of putting a mental institution right next to the tracks, with the only entrance to the compound being right next to the train station. A lot of them would just walk out and take the leap of faith. ",1
"Monopoly has a lot of house rules/unfollowed rules that actually make the game worse:

* If a property isn't purchased when it's landed on, it's supposed to go up for auction. Obviously not doing this makes the game go on much longer.

* Free Parking isn't supposed to give you a reward when you land on it. This is a pretty big one: that influx of cash 99 times out of 100 doesn't allow for a ""big comeback"" that people intuitively think it does, it just softens the blow of the next few big payouts, and makes the game drag on.

* Houses and hotels sell back at half value. Otherwise you get stupid shit like someone owning all the orange and pink and just moving houses around when getting a full refund, since they cost the same to build on both properties.",23

Let yourself feel the heartbreak,  it never goes away if you try abs run from it.  It wears off slmost like a drug.

Immerse yourself in your life and just do everything 100%.

Go to work and be awesome. Dont turn down a single social event. Nothing going on? Organize something and lead the pack

Hit the gym and give it 100%

Buy some new clothes with the extra money you have from work. Find ways to make more money because money is freedom.

The best revenge is being happier than your ex. And make sure everyone sees how awesome your life is.

Pro tip (i got emotionally abused, cheated on then dumped for guy she cheated with)

Be there for your friends. Give your relationships 100%. Get in the habit of noticing more details about people (last stranger you met; what color were their eyes?) Once you have that habit down;  comment on changes you notice and give people genuine compliments. 

People will feel like you genuinely care. They will feel less alone/insignificant and they will be drawn to you for it. They are usually more than happy to return the favor namsayin?

You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.

You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world.

Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.

And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?

You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.

On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.

You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate,
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.

I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.

You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond
the laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.

The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn’t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.

True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us ”normal” people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are ”challenged” persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I would have never read your post. It just wouldn’t have been ”right”.
Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.

"This is interesting, what about upkeep and maintenance costs? Lifespan of fibre is a hell of a lot longer than copper, especially in the more tropical and natural disaster areas of Australia. 

I mean, for example, lets take a neighbourhood, one of which has FTTP from a neighbourhood distrubution point and another neighbourhood using FTTN. Fibre has a life span of of what, 50yrs? 100yrs? Lets work off 50, thats a pretty safe assumption. Then we have copper, now we are wanting to compare apples to apples here, and we all know that in Australia, copper cables do not maintain their quality after 50 years, so for arguments sake lets say 20yrs, thats about how long it was until the copper line to my parents place had to be swapped over due to damage. Things like people cutting cables when digging have to be presumed to be just as likely for both, so when we are talking about call out fees in pure man hours, copper is going to cost more. Also, splicing fibre cables is not as difficult as it used to be. Sure its no walk in the park, but it is still a lot quicker than it used to be.

"Mari Illustrious Makinami from the Evangelion movies. She has no place in a series filled with wonderfuly complex characters while she has no development whatsoever except for a couple scenes where she proves herself to be a Deus Ex Machina with big anime tits. There's three instances of the word ""fuck"" throughout the entire series- two of which were during the emotional peaks of the original movie (which are two of my favorite moments of the series) and then she just uses it during a fight fo rno god damn reason. There's a time and a place to drop the F-bomb, and that wasn't it. Plus, she ruined the SPOILER scene in 3.33 where Kaworu died. Five seconds after a major character and the kinda-love interest of the main character fucking dies in a dramatic sacrifice, we're treated with her tits flopping all over the screen. Compare that to the original version of the scene, where we have a full minute and a half of somber stillness to process the weight of what's going on.

She read a sexual book in class about molestation and rape I think it's called ""the purple book"" but not 100% sure. EVEN THOUGH THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH OUR COURSE.

Before she got fired she claimed that her father had died and made students buy coffee for her, she made the TA do all the teaching which just consisted of reading stories that weren't related to our course.

"my wife and i have both cheated on each other, and we went through some really rough times.  we have been married almost 6 years now, and we have generally been very happy.  about 2-3 years ago, my wife came out to me as bisexual.  i'm cool with this, but i was concerned that she was not happy seeing as she never once experienced a sexual encounter with a woman before (southern christian upbringing on both sides).  we have been somewhat open before (we are allowed to make out with people at bars if we are both present, for example), so we set up a ""date"" with a female acquaintance.  i went to the bar with a friend that night, and they did their thing.  no big deal.  well, my wife also has a pretty bad eating disorder, which makes me sad to see her undressed.  this has led to lack of motivation in the bedroom.  so after some troubles here, i found out my wife was going over to the female acquaintance's house on days she had to ""stay late at work"".  i see that she needed affection, and i wasn't giving it.  so we tried to discuss things, and we were cool for a while, but i was still holding onto some resentment.  at the time, i was depressed, angry, and rather drunk a lot.  one night, i proceeded to drink about a fifth of whiskey, and i went out to this club that is known for being an excellent place to hook up.  it's like a black hole of bad decisions.  long story short: i got a bj in a photo booth.   


since then, my wife an i have taken active steps to address our relationship head on.  basically we sat on the couch for hours discussing divorce and what we wanted in a relationship.  after this, and after seeing actual progress, i can tell we both love each other and can feel that from each other again.  she has made actual progress with her eating disorder and i have seriously cut back on drinking, which has helped a lot.  now, we are back to the way things were, and we are best friends again.  so now this is on the internets.

"Heart felt current life experience post incoming 

This whole post is really hitting home for me right now. I recently decided to end a 10 year relationship, 2 years married. We were young when we started dating (17, high school). I still absolutly care for this woman, and would do anything in the world for her. I still think I might love her, but it just didn't feel right, I didn't feel like she actually cared about me. She was afraid to lose me, but didn't put in the effort I needed. About every 3 years in our relationship I would feel unappreciated, and start looking around for affection else where. I would invariably get found out, we would break up for a bit, and then get back together. It also didn't help that I didn't find her attractive after the first year (she was overweight when we started dating, but became obese). I looked at porn and masturbated despite her thinking that was cheating. 


We stayed together through a lot of life events, deaths, her parents divorce, etc. We grew up with each other and helped mold each other into the people we are. I was scared to leave that, partially because I knew who she was, and she knew who I was. We were comfortable. But over the past few years I have continued to grow and she hasn't. We began growing apart, and I don't think she realized it, but I certainly did. 


She would mention how she wanted me to be more passionate in bed, and I would tell her that I needed her to be more fit, at least to TRY to be more fit to help me feel that. But she would walk a mile, post her ""victory"" on Facebook, and then fall back into her old habits. This drove me INSANE. I felt like I didn't matter to her. I did most of the hose hold chores (cook, daily cleaning, grocery shopping, walk the dog, pay bills) and when I asked her to help out walking the dogs, she did it once and then never again. Even on days she had off (sometimes she worked weekends and had weekdays off) I would come home from work and she hadn't taken the dogs out for their evening walk, even though I did it that morning so she didn't have to wake up and I also did it on my days off... Regardless of feeling so undervalued and unappreciated, I didn't leave because of the comfort of knowing what I had and the fear of losing it.


I finally told her that it wasn't working for me and it has been the hardest 4 months of my life. I question my decision constantly, but if I go back it would be because of the comfort and the fear. I didn't feel like I could grow with this woman, and I don't think she could grow with me.


I recognize that I failed to communicate my needs as effectively as I could have, but I did try. And I'm not putting this all on her. I know I played a role. She will make someone VERY happy one day. I wish it could have been me. 


TL;DR
Left my wife whom I had been with for 10 years because I wasn't attracted to her for most of the relationship, and didn't feel appreciated at the end. I was too scared leave for years, it is the hardest thing I have ever done, and I'm still scared of what I have done.",2

For a homeopathic remedy I would take one drop of an ingredient that causes the symptoms I'm trying to cure, and dilute that in a jug of water. Then I would take a drop of water from that jug and dilute it into another jug and keep repeating the process.

"I have seen a lot of posts that reflect things that I have tried and had various levels of success with. I move a lot, I have lived in 4 states in the last few years transferring with work. I have found that having no friends is one of the most stressful things in my life. It has resounding effects that are hard to notice until you make a friend and it's like the sun comes out. Anyway, here are things that I do to remain sane.  

1. Meetups- I am not Mr. Social, but going out is important. I go out with one goal, to meet an talk to 2-3 people, and hope I can find someone that I connect with.  

2. Exercise - Several days every week I go outside and take a nice walk, or jog, cycle, swim, anything to get outside and soak up some sun. It helps.  

3. Books, audiobooks, and non TV entertainment - I find TV drains my energy and I try to control my time enjoying it. I find it fun, I like it, but too much is bad.  

4. I joined some social networking groups. For me, running groups. I run alone (cuz I'm super slow) but I joined a several groups and follow other runners. Occasionally post, and try to keep up with other slow people.  

5. Explore - Art galleries, museums, zoos... I like art galleries because at small ones you can usually chat with the manager/owner and get some real interesting insight into art. I know nothing about art, and chatting with these people has helped me begin to understand what some of the paintings are all about.  

6. I talk to my family a lot. They live far away, so I cannot hang out with them, but I call a couple times per week.  

7. I have at various times gone to a counselor to help when life got overwhelming. It's funny how much stuff builds up and how little it takes to push you from under control to barely coping to completely overwhelmed.  

8. Hobby groups - I usually find these through meetups, but I like to dance, most dance communities have a webpage.  

9. Volunteer - This is an interesting way to meet people. I volunteer sometimes at the humane society.

10. Limit Internet Time - I try to limit my time on Facebook and similar sites as they have been linked to increased risk of depression.  

Anyway, this is what I do in every town/city I have lived in. It doesn't always work quickly, but it has proven effective. I have been in Oklahoma for 6 months now, and just recently plugged into a group. Oklahoma is not a fun place to not have any friends. Now that I have a group, it is looking less crappy.

So I've sold a few pairs of sweaty socks to someone (long story) and am seriously thinking about starting a website/blog where people, I'm assuming GUYS, with foot/sock fetishes could view my photos and buy my socks.

"&gt; Eating vegan is actually NOT healthier and is a misconception .

The following verifiable statements were recently posted on Reddit:


American Dietetic Association

*It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.*

Dietitians of Canada

*A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.*

The British National Health Service

*With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.*

The Dietitians Association of Australia

*Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.*

The National Health and Medical Research Council

*Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.*

The Mayo Clinic

*A well-planned vegetarian diet (see context) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.*

The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada

*Vegetarian diets (see context) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.*

Harvard Medical School

*Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses.*

"&gt;Back when I was 18 and naive and full of good intentions, first time living with a boyfriend, he ended up pressuring me into doing half of his homework for him and doing all the cooking. 

Why did you agree?

&gt;So I was losing sleep staying up trying to do his homework and mine, he wouldn't eat if I didn't fix his food, he would randomly get pissed at me and refuse to tell me why, wasn't paying full rent or contributing to food expenses or utility bills. 


Why did you let him do that?

&gt; Got a puppy that hated me and shit in two pairs of my shoes, and the sex was bad. On top of all this he was occasionally very insulting like saying I wasn't the prettiest girl he'd dated or that I wouldn't make a good mother. I was physically breaking down from emotional stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep, I had sores in my mouth constantly and felt like I was dying. 

And again, why were you allowing this?

then id also open a big rock climbing facility, with both bouldering and legit rocks. id get some huge ass mountain side somehow transported over so its local, accessible, and ""here"". 

meanwhile id get another huge ass facility for wood working. i mean like a pool hall of wood working. organized nicely, few of the same table saws, band saws, jointers, routers, lathes and various minor things. it would be an after school program for teens, and adults whenever.

probably my 3 favorite things made available to everyone. granted i only have a skill saw, a couple drills and a grinder myself.

very gratifying, would be fun to share with people given the money+space+facility. same with having changed out brakes, rotors, strut+spring, brake line, timing belt recently after having never even jacked up a car as of last summer. so ive since got a socket set for this past christmas. id probably end up buying every tool and doing really stupid things with them because its fun though.",3

"John Cena.

I was at a Detroit Tigers game and saw a crowd of people surrounding and taking pictures with some guy that I didn't even recognize.  I watched Wrestling years prior but it his face and size didn't register up to his larger-than-life persona.  I was taller than him at 11, and thought I might as well get a photo with this guy anyway, so I did.  I ended up walking away, then turned around to see 'CENA' written on his personal jersey.  That was a funny day.",1

All it does is frighten kids about college.

"I was thinking about my childhood recently and realized that my family really never spent time together as a family, you know? Both my parents tended to leave my sister and I to entertain ourselves, which basically meant sitting in front of a screen somewhere. I feel like my mom was affectionate and I know for a fact that she loved me, but alcoholism really stole what could have been from us. My dad.... Eugh.

It's just weird comparing it to the family I'm living with now. They spend SO much time together, they hug a lot more. I get a lot more physical affection living here. Sometimes I get lonely and I crave companionship, but at the same the high-amount of together-time gets to be too much for me. I'm just not used to it.",1
