Two birds one stone kind of thing!!

**ALternative to ObamaCare:**

Here are a few suggestions for health care reform that is real reform vs. the democrat plan to siphon the burden onto somebody else:

1) Allow health insurance companies to compete across state lines. This would reduce 'overhead' costs as the providers of health insurance no longer have to set up separate companies for every different state they operate in.

2) Pass a law that bans disqualification for pre-existing conditions. The insurance companies even support this as long as the rule applies equally to all of them.

3) Place strict limits on medical malpractice lawsuits. Right now over half the medical tests and procedures performed are done so with the primary purpose of protecting the doctor from liability - not because the doctor really thinks the test is needed.

4) Institute a health care tax credit for individuals and families. In addition institute a 'catastrophic care' plan that can be purchased with these credits. Individuals can then decide whether to pay their health expenses out of pocket or to use the tax credit to buy insurance.

5) Provide a tax credit for companies that provide health insurance. This reduces the cost of providing insurance to the company and encourages those that currently do not offer insurance to offer it.

6) Cap welfare payments at the second child. Since there is a strong correlation between people who need public assistance and lack of medical insurance this will discourage large 'welfare families.'

Furthermore, as to his point that objectifying the first lady would probably be more edgy at this point, I have to admit he's also correct - Palin has done such a good job objectifying herself that quite frankly there's not much left for anyone else to do, while Michelle Obama is still a respectable figure.

The government is allowed to do that.  The government can undersell all the private competitors, charge the loss to the taxpayer, and drive the private companies all out of business.  Then there will just be one provider, the government, and it will be a monopoly.

You're suggesting that one group's inflated support of Obama's policies ARTIFICIALLY inflates the overall opinion poll.  However, the overall opinion is the sum of its parts.  There's nothing artificial about that.

It's been said plenty here, but it's perfectly fitting: maybe we should count the African-American polls for only 3/5 to normalize things a little for you.

Obama needs to drop his 'bipartisan agreement' fantasy. The GOP won't be adding anything to the table as long as a Democrat is in the White House.

Obama's quietly pushing defense budgets through to hide the cost of the wars.  Bush held ""enemy combatants"" indefinitely, with vague plans to try them by tribunal at some point down the road.

And that's without even addressing all the other things I could point to that he promise he'd fix and hasn't, like warantless wiretapping of American citizens.  Where's the improvement?  He's just allowing the same bad policies to continue, unchanged, his election promises be damned, and I can't even begin to imagine how you can see the same shit as an ""improvement"" when it hasn't changed a single iota.",3
"I don't think anyone's laughing about Davie's appointment.  I personally wouldn't enjoy my sexuality being used for a humorous point, and I somewhat doubt that's what's going on here.

If you want to read into it that way, take some time to remember when McCain picked some female running-mate to compete with Obama's dark skinnedness despite her complete lack of experience/intelligence/sanity.  There was a lot of outrage going on about how McCain was attempting to play a disadvantaged minority card to keep in the race.",3
"It's also the reason we have someone as terrible as Obama in the white house, so really we're also to blame. Now because of how hated Bush was (and the fact the media only gives coverage to the 2 parties that are the same) we have someone that has already spent more than every president combined and it hasn't even been a full year yet. On top of that he wants to make the Federal Reserve even more powerful.

But we are mainly to blame because there are so many people who go vote and all they think is ""yea democrats are for me cause I'm not rich and they will do whatever they can to get me free shit"", in reality thats not the case because while sure they are making things like nationalized healthcare to help the people without jobs and such...it kills it for people who pay for their own healthcare such as me and they end up raising taxes because they are spending more than they make. It's stupid things like that that people think selfishly and not on the bigger picture. All people can think of is ""this will get me health care finally"", only to find out later it costs 1.2 trillion per year due to the population and it almost can barely cover anything due to retarded cost within the healthcare system. Do remember they pay a stupid amount for a hammer and a toilet seat, same thing applies to everything else. They pay too much for everything.

I do however agree with you, Bush is partially to blame and sure we should be mad at him for not doing enough to stop or attempt to prevent our current situation. However, now we have a new president to focus on so I wish people would focus more on him otherwise we will just end up pointing fingers at him next time and ignoring the next president.",1

The best you can do is nudge it along far in advance of any obstacles, and the momentum of whatever impulse you give to it will last a long time after the impulse is gone.

There would have to be some sort of cutoff mark to determine which parties have substantial enough support (maybe 5-10%?) to warrant this, but having, say, 45 minutes for all parties at a MINIMUM in television media, plus a predetermined guaranteed minimum of financial backing, might do well to shake things up.

"Fellow citizens; friends, family, and brothers and sisters in arms, we have a new Commander in Chief. We have today witnessed a moment that will crash down like lightning onto the pages of history, burning the memory of a time where change was actually made into the hearts and souls of a people. Today a single man has emboldened the young, refreshed the old, and inspired the capable. To cherish the moment is righteous.

However, I will not obfuscate my unease. With Bush, we were so weary, so disappointed in the choice of our other half, it came naturally to question and critique the blunders of his regime. Jingoism was attacked and so called truths fed to us were blatant lies in the eyes of everyone who was sick and tired of being lied to.

The pedestal President Obama's supporters place him upon gives me cause to fret. Can a living legend do any wrong? If a Saint never dies, are his means and ends justified? What will the American people do in President Obama's name that they would have started a revolution over, if asked the same from Bush?

Under Obama, you non military types will probably be drafted into some sort of civil or military service. The President has said so himself. ""If America goes to war, everyone goes."" If this had been a quote from Bush, you would hear laughter and the crisp sounds of passports being pulled out of thin wallets. But President Obama said it. I relayed this quote to a stranger recently, and was told they would gladly serve. Does this not seem a departure in the American people from the usual business when it comes to matters of serving your country?

Yes, the words hope and change have been heard by all recently. Could the mere repetition of these words actually instill their meanings into the minds of Americans? I think it could. I do not question the quality or character of Obama supporters. Good people are found in all four corners and I do not wish to single Obama supporters out for being brainwashed O_o

The jingoism is no longer forced, or even faked anymore. The people who believe in Obama are blinded to the fact that he is a walking, talking constituent of the Democratic Party. Not only that, but above it, he has attended Bilderberger meetings, CFR meetings, and has Zionists in his cabinet. He is loyal to a system that transcends America and breaches the conduct of Republicism. He is loyal to control. He is loyal to the ideals of a few, not to the wellbeing of a people; loyal to advancing the goals of his masters, not to advancing the goals of you.

The government has no business when it comes to getting you a job,helping you keep your job, or even whether or not you are able to live after you stop working. It has only made these things it's business, because they like to be liked. The government has no business in deciding a great many more things, like who you marry, what drugs you do, what you think, say, see, or do.

And yet they do.

They do it while shielded behind a document that brought hope and change to the world, a document that is supposed to be our shield, our light in the darkness. A document that has timeless words written upon it. Words easily ignored by men and women that we the People have a duty to question, a duty to try, and a duty to punish for breaching Our trust.

Hope and change are just words. One is intangible and the other is constant. Try instilling them both for your own reasons, and not because someone with a strong voice told you to.",-6

Fox News just blatantly lies all the time about stuff.  Hell half of Olbermann's show involved showing clips of Fox News lying.  There is a reason Fox News cannot do the same thing back to any other network.

Their only attempt was to criticize all the other media for ignoring the ""Fox 9/12 Project"".

In these counties the college vote pulled the race. [VA 2008 vote by counties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Virginia_Presidential_Election_Results_by_County,_2008.svg)

Also the younger and minority populations in SE VA in Hampton, Newport News, Chesapeake, and Norfolk came out for the presidential election. 

These same demographics were apathetic about the Gubernatorial election and did not show up to vote. This is just my opinion, but the majority that showed up to vote were older individuals who are deeply conservative and had the time and motivation to vote. 

I do not think this has so much to do with the candidate or whether he was progressive enough. It is not possible to compare the importance of this election compared to the one for Obama who pulled people who would not normally vote.",5

(I hated Bush as a person, and never met him either)...but I'm very concerned about hs keeping Gates on as Sec.of Defense from the Bush mis-administration, his hiring a friggin' Monsanto guy to head the FDA, AND his reluctance to stand up to the banksters, and his continual robbing of the American people through further dminishing their dollar value by letting the Fed continue to create money out of thin air, and giving it to the corporations. (The Fed is a Cartel of private banks, and is not part of or loyal to the US or any other government or group of regular, non-millionaire people!)

So, I sort of like Obama, as he is a likeable guy, unlike the obvious scumbag Bush...(I voted for Ron Paul, writing in his name -- in case you haven't guessed), other than the fact that he's screwing all the citizens royally, and helping the super rich to get richer.

The person who inspired Paul the most was a crazy little russian woman by the name of Ayn Rand, (you can tell, 'cause he named his kid after her) who twisted the words of people like Adam Smith to serve her agenda.  Besides, it doesn't matter if he claims to be inspired by these people, because at this point, 200 years on, the works of men like Smith and Ferguson might as well be biblical texts, interpreted differently by each and every person who reads them.  I've read convincing arguments that Adam Smith was a hardcore liberal who was against all forms of corporate capitalism, and convincing arguments that he would applaud our modern day economy.  It doesn't matter either way.  Adam Smith is dead, and was writing about an economy that is dead.  It doesn't have the bearing on modern day economics that everyone says it does.  

&gt;Now there is a US legislator named Ron Paul who happens to be liked by progressives such as Ralph Nader and Dennis Kucinich.

Simply because Paul is the sort of refreshing opponent who works with flawed logic instead of no logic doesn't mean that either of those men *agree* with Paul, just that they like him.  To put the Kucinich stamp of approval on Paul is disingenuous at best.

And yes, I agree that most people have become complacent.  Our society holds something so meaningless as money up as being the pinnacle of human achievement...as if it were the most important thing in one's life.  This goes against everything that we feel to be true (after a few millennia or so of evolution telling us otherwise).

  Since most of us spend a majority of our lives striving for what we feel to be a lie (that money is important, and the other associated lies of corporatism hiding under the facade of free-market capitalism), we feel personally attacked when that lie is questioned (because we've invested so much in it) and close ourselves off to the truth (that our suffering is caused by that lie) and, instead, look to the 'other' as a cause (blame it on socialism, blame it on obama, etc).  When a 3rd party that seems authoritative on the matter steps in and say's ""you're suffering because of X"" it confirms your feelings of victimization from 'the other' and literally makes you feel better (neuro-chemically speaking) to accept that lie, rather than the uncomfortable feeling that comes from questioning the underlying assumptions that you've used to build your life upon.",-1

"In that clip, what both sides said was awash in total nonsense.

Armey just said that US seniors are ""forced"" to have Medicare.  So what?  Don't directly pay for it.  Don't have to use it if don't want.  Maybe there is some little issue for Christian Scientists who do not want to receive any medical care, but that's at most just a distraction in the current debate.

For the other guy, he was lying like a crook through his teeth about the main point of HR 3200:  Look, the *public option* is not, as Obama has been claiming at recent town hall meetings, just an *alternative* to private insurance to keep the private companies ""honest"".  Not at all.  Indeed, there is a video clip of Barney Frank explaining that a good public option is the best path to single-payer.  And there are plenty of video clips of Obama saying that his goal in his first term in office is a single-payer, universal health plan. Also, the private insurance companies are 100% correct:  They won't be able to compete with the public option, mostly because  that option will get over the next 10 years a large fraction of $1.2T from the IRS -- indeed, a lot in HR 3200 is changes in the IRS code.  Also, in HR 3200, there is a *Commissioner* and a committee who have centralized, essentially total control of all health care in the US, with no liability, no accountability, no continuing role for Congress, e.g., as now to set Medicare reimbursment rates, etc.  The goal of Obama and HR 3200 is exactly ObamaCare run directly from Washington.  

HR 3200 is a radical, far-left proposal, not much like England or France, and closer to the old Soviet Union.  And that is likely the main goal:  An  *ethic* of *security* from the government.  Indeed, *ethics* are a big part of the foundation of HR 3200 but so far not much discussed in the debate.  Reading HR 3200, have to quickly reject that this thing was just written by the House or just written this year.  Instead, that thing came off some shelf where it has been sitting as a dream and a plan for a long time.  From whom?  Likely Rahm Emanual's brother, maybe with some help of the staff of Senator Kennedy, and a small academic *health care policy planning optimal multi-objective resource allocation of limited resources research* community who have for years now been dreaming up their *ideal*, driven heavily by their *ethics* of essentially JUST ""From each according to their abilities.  To each according to their needs."" and ""Serve the most needy first"", etc.  Go read some of Rahm Emanual's brother's old stuff on such *ethics* and
*research*.  

Instead of this far out, radical nonsense, what we need are some good proposals.  

Obama?  As in his recent town hall meetings, we know: (1) He is lying about his goal of just insurance reform.  Instead, as is totally clear from his relevant statments over the past few years at YouTube, he wants a ""single-payer, universal health care plan"" in his ""first term of office"".  (2) As in his town hall remarks about saving money from reducing surgery physicians do just to make money, he does not have even DIP SQUAT understanding of healt care.  In particular, he just got nailed, badly, with a LOT of contempt, from the US American College of Surgeons.  On health care thinking, Obama needs adult supervision.

We DO need to do better, but we won't get a better path from either of the two people in the News Hour clip, Obama, or the far-left academics who wrote HR 3200.  Maybe we should import some experts from England, France, Germany, Switzerland, etc. to get us started.",1

From all I can tell, what Armey said was wacko.

What the other guy said was, net, more dangerous:  As at YouTube, over the past few years before last November, Obama was talking loud and clear about his goal of a single-payer, universal health plan.  As at YouTube, Barney Frank makes totally clear that a good public option is the best path to single-payer.  Why?  Because HR 3200 will require people to have MUCH more in health insurance.  Then the public option will have so much money from the IRS, more power to negotiate lower rates, larger pools, less overhead per patient, etc. that private insurance will not be able to compete and, soon, the public option will become single-payer.  If the public option were simply an *exchange* where people get into pools run by the private insurance companies, who get their own collections of doctors, etc., with no subsidies, then that might not lead to single-payer.     But when the public option becomes single-payer and as in HR 3200 there is a *Commissioner*, Obama will then be less than 1 mm from his goal of a universal health plan, that is, by a stroke of the pen from the Commissioner NOT subject to review by Congress (got to read HR 3200).

You are correct that have to ""phrase that carefully"".  If he wants to talk about unnecessary tests, e.g., as *defensive* medicine, maybe okay, but tonsils out, NO WAY.  Here he blew it, and much of his credibility, especially on health care, quickly.  The American College of Surgeons nailed him hard.

You are severely dilusional if you think this is any different from McCain's position. By all indications, action in Iraq is winding down, so ""combat troops"" would have been coming out no matter who the president was. When McCain made his infamous ""hundred years"" remark, he likened Iraq to Korea, which is not an active war zone.

He, like Obama, had no intention of ending the actual occupation, and he, like Obama, planned on simply moving the troops from Iraq and into the equally-pointless war in Afghanistan. Their foreign policies with regard to Iraq and Afghanistan are practically identical. But hey, far be it for me to break up the Obama circle jerk.

"&gt; Yes, he quite often says ""Israel will be wiped off the map""

That is incorrect. First, he doesn't say it ""quite often"". Second, this is pro-war/anti-Iranian propaganda.

In the US, the foremost academic center for Middle Eastern study is the Univ. of Michigan. One of the leaders of U.Mich.'s program is Dr. Juan Cole, who speaks fluent Farsi. Dr. Cole has widely refuted the ""wipe off the map"" propaganda, [stating](http://www.juancole.com/2009/02/could-khatami-be-irans-obama.html):

&gt; I object to this translation of what he said on two grounds. First, it gives the impression that he wants to play Hitler to Israel's Poland, mobilizing an armored corps to move in and kill people. But the actual quote, which comes from an old speech of Khomeini, does not imply military action, or killing anyone at all. The second reason is that it is just an inexact translation. The phrase is almost metaphysical. He quoted Khomeini that ""the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time.""

From the article cited, it refutes the claim when it bluntly states:

&gt; **He** **wants** **to** **wipe** **Israel** **off** **the** **map!** That’s what we were told in our news media’s hysterical reporting of Ahmadinejad's speech to the “World Without Zionism” conference in Tehran on 26 October 2005. Except it turns out that, when correctly translated, he didn’t really say that Israel must be wiped off the map, but that ""the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time"", which is not a threat of war or annihilation, but an expression of hope for regime change.

As a further refuting of the bogus claim, the article cites [this German-translated article](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article12790.htm) which also states Iran's leader has never said he wanted to wipe Israel off the map.

Yes, a lot of liberals hated Bush and compared him to Hitler, and truthfully I thought a lot of the rhetoric and propaganda political techniques were quite reminiscent of how Hitler came to power and something that I and others felt should be dealt with POLITICALLY. 
These liberals did not advocate or recommend armed insurrection to ""reclaim out country"". That is just crazy talk and if any liberal said something like that they would have been admonished by the leadership and by the majority of their fellow progressives/liberals.

"While it is useful that you found an example for me, I question if disagreeing with adding an additional $25 billion for highways to a ""economic recover program"" is the same as what I was suggesting.

Using common politics, the democrats added everything they wanted to the stimulus, and once they felt assured that they could get it, they add another $25 billion for roads etc.  At this point, the vote against this addition is more than likely an attempt to stop the uncontrolled spending that can be easily spun as republican hate against public works programs.  The sheer number of earmarks attached to this bill are absurd yet once the end is in sight, republicans try to stop another $25 billion that just happens to be for public works.

The point I am trying to make is that most every politician is for public works programs such as roads and water projects.  This is something that they can bring home to their states and say, ""See I did something for our community"".

Meanwhile mass transit, while wonderful in concept and ultimately necessary for a more efficient infrastructure, is commonly a money pit in the US.  For instance, the DART system here  in Dallas is a constant drain on resources for the city.  While I would love nothing more than a high speed train from Dallas to Austin or past there to San Antonio, I have no doubt that it would be a never ending financial drain on our state.

In Japan, high speed trains work because their country is tiny.  Infrastructures like trains, highways, high speed internet, etc, are much cheaper to provide to the masses as they all live in such condensed areas.

What we need is a plan to develop high speed trains that are capable of turning a profit, or at least fit into our budget without requiring an increase in taxes that is unbearable.  For me, unbearable is if I pay more in taxes and train tickets each year than I currently do to just drive to Austin as I do every few weeks for family.

I love all of the improved national pride now that we have Obama in office and a democratically controlled congress but I am highly skeptical that they can actually deliver a viable means to achieve all of the projects that they have practically promised for us.

They have promised an almost utopian society in which all people are healthy, worry free, travel easily, and reduce our pollution to a level where all of the animals of the world will begin to live in harmony with us again.

Unfortunately, since they are politicians, I think that these items will only be achieved for their friends and themselves while we foot the bill for loads of failed government projects.",1

More civilians have died in Afghanistan in the few months that Obama has been in power than ever before.

Face this too - you were all fooled into believing that Obama would bring any sort of change. You have all been had.

The two party system is like two hands of the same beast. Each hand shows a puppet - they have figured out that everyone won't like the two puppets equally. they will always like one over the other.

"&gt;""domestic""? As in where I am right now? Well... that would be Japan.

&gt;I know what a bow is here. The degree does have significance. You're just copying an pasting replies directed toward US right wingers.

I meant ""Domestically"" as a polite way of saying ""from a western mind-set.""

The significance of the ""degree of bow"" isn't lost on me, as I've done extensive business with Japanese business men (having to go so far as to learn the proper way to offer up a business card, as apparently the western style is seen as boorish by some of the older set).

When I asked a Nipponese colleague about if the 15* bow would have been more appropriate, his statement was something to the effect of ""I can't think of another time that's more appropriate to use the most formal bow than when meeting the Emperor.""

As you're a recent arrival to Japan, you may do well to remember that the culture is only about two generations removed from believing the Emperor was a divine being.  For other redditors following along at home, the nearest English translation for the title still in use today (tennō) is ""heavenly emperor.""  

I'm by no means an expert in Japan, or her customs.  I do not live there.  But I'd hazard that, regarding the emperor, formality is probably important for a few more years.

&gt;It's even made more awkward by the fact that he combined both.

Obama combining both was, indeed, a breach of formal etiquette.  It should be noted, however that if you watch the film, there was a moment of indecision about whether it would be a handshake or a bow.  It looks to me like the emperor extended his hand first, but it's hard to say without doing a frame-by-frame... which is a bit too excessive for me.

Regardless, Obama was presented a problem: Do you shake hands, not bow and look like an obnoxious westerner in the eyes of the world?  Or do you bow and leave the emperor hanging there, his hand outstretched and un-shaken?  Or you could do a quick, curt bow, then go on to the handshake... making the whole affair look aggressive and forced?

He made the best of a bad situation.  It wasn't perfect, but it was probably the smartest move.",1

Sure, you can say that the economic pressure is intimidation, and that coercion is suppressing free speech.  However, claiming that people have no right to boycott or organize a boycott would also be act of attempting to suppress an individual's freedom.

"iReport — So the reason the Republicans are pure scum is simple and visible to all: all they do is talk garbage. In Denver, the Democrats rallied in front of the world, promising change and giving examples of what the party will do to help America. While watching the Republican National Convention, all I witnessed was mud-slinging, trash-talking and cheap shots at a party that is looking to pull the country out of the hole the Republicans have dug in the past 8 years. Obama talked about the middle-class, the economy, education yada yada yada... Guiliani (who should be banned from New York City for life) did not mention any of this. All he did was verbally bash Obama. Pailn's speach was impressive.. if you are impressed by the same rhetoric and nonsense that Bush has been regurgitating for the past decade. It is a sad world we live in when it has become this close. The fact that the gap between Obama and McCain is so close makes me ashamed to be an American and saddens me deeply. This is the United States of America. We are supposed to be the example and all we are is a JOKE. The world sees us as a war-loving, drill-happy place where minds and eyes are closed and ethnocentrism flourishes. Another thing that bothered me beyond explanation during the RNC was the fact Palin talked about taxes this and taxes that, cuts here and cuts there... but the problem was she wasn't speaking to the country, she was speaking to the rich scum in the arena watching the clowns do their act. If the Republicans win this election, I will leave this country. The Republicans are a dying breed who won't do anything to help, nothing. NADA. http://www.lulu.com/content/3613076

While his decisions might be flawed I believe that he really believed in most of them while being ""tricked"" into others. Let him write his book, explaining his actions. I am sure there is more to some of the decisions than we, people screaming ""Justice!!"", know about at the moment. While screaming that the US and Israelis are hypocritical we might as well have become that ourselves without even knowing.

We can remain the world’s leading importer of oil, or we can become the world’s leading exporter of clean energy,” said President Obama. “We can hand over the jobs of the future to our competitors, or we can confront what they have already recognized as the great opportunity of our time: the nation that leads the world in creating new sources of clean energy will be the nation that leads the 21st century global economy. That’s the nation I want America to be.”*

"Looks like more propaganda from Rahm's Reddit Raiders!  How much are you people getting paid?

Yes, there are problems.

But, it is possible to be worse.  A ""change"" is not necessarily an improvement.

First, consider Dr.  Obama:  What does he know about our health care system?  It turns out, an average parent knows more than he does.  His remarks on health care in July and August were described at

http://www.facs.org/news/obama081209.html

by the American College of Surgeons as ""uninformed"", ""ill-informed"", ""inflammatory"", and ""dangerous"".  On health care, he doesn't know dip squat.  So far, he is just speaking in vague generalities about some bill that does not exist.

The main bill that does exist is HR 3200, all 1017 pages, and it would make our health care system **MUCH** worse.

For a better health care system, we need better advice than movies by Michael Moore and 'Frontline'.

First up, we need to know, in the US and several other countries, where does the money go?  Only then can we start talking about enough ""savings"" to have good coverage for everyone.

There is much more we need to know.  We won't get it from Obama either because he doesn't know or because what his best informed advisors know he doesn't want us to know.

An airplane designed like Obama-HR 3200 would just create a ball of fire on the runway and never get off the ground.

A **lot** in our current health care system is brilliant, by far the best in the world, in quality the envy of the world.  Making it better will be **tough** and need more brilliant work.  The system does **not** need Quacktopractic Obama doing open heart surgery with his dirty, rusty pocket knife.  Keep Obama as far away as possible from anything operational and important, especially health care.

Your mortgage with the bank is counted as an asset on the bank balance sheet. If they pay you $100k and you pay it to the bank the bank still has $100k in total assets, but will get less in interest over time - they are worse off in net terms. You are happy but the bankers and government is unhappy because its deflationary and reduces income in our debt based economy.

If instead they give the money to the bank then the bank has $200k in assets and your ongoing interest stream. In theory they are supposed to turn around and through fractional reserve numbers lend another ~$900k, giving the banks a net $1100k in assets. Bankers are happy, government is happy, you are still in debt.

Of course they are not actually doing that yet, keeping hold of the cash against your debt turning bad - but that can only go on so long. Thumbscrews will be turned and the banks that survive will be rich.

In conclusion, you didn't really think you were going to win out of this did you? You will end up paying in increased taxes to enrich the banks and shoulder the bad debt - because that's how the system is setup to work.

"&gt;So you are asking government prosecutors not to aggressively defend their position that is defined by the letter of the law?

What they think the letter of the law is, is precisely what's at issue and the stupidest thing anyone could do is reflexively and unquestioningly assume that their behavior is consistent with the law and that anyone challenging them must be wrong. State secrets, and willful violations can be invoked as defenses in cases where they don't apply at all, thereby throwing legal hurdles in the way of cases that might otherwise see justice.

Refusing to bring charges against detainees, and blocking evidence from being used against the government in wiretapping cases, that's stonewalling.

And how they structure their defense says *everything* about the restraint, or lack thereof that they are willing to exercise when given the power to abuse these provisions. 

&gt;Call me dense, but wouldn't it be better to change the letter of the law back to what it was before to allow for redress instead of asking government prosecutors to ignore standing statutes they are required to follow?

That's a different conversation at best, a distractionary tactic at worst. If they are taking advantage of provisions that make it nearly impossible to bring a case against the government, that's disgusting and despicable, not to mention a little authoritarian.

&gt;If these government prosecutors failed to use the willful violations defense, they would be guilty of prosecutorial malpractice.

Then, in your words, the Bush admin DOJ was guilty of malpractice, as this defense *never* actually was used until the Obama DOJ. You are also (again) uncritically granting that the willful disclosure defense is valid merely because the DOJ happens to be raising it.

Back to your original comment- its literally false that they were ""compelled"" to stonewall such as they have. ""Willful disclosure"" doesn't apply just because the DOJ says it does, and nothing is stopping them from using and recklessly abusing it to shut down any and all legal challenges that might be brought forth against the government. In the instances mentioned by the blogger, it appears that this is exactly what has occurred.",12
"I noticed that too. He ignored the question, but (as much as I love Helen Thomas), it really was a gotcha question. 

With Mitchell in the Middle East for the first time as Obama's envoy, and an election in Israel tomorrow, it's understandable why he kept his mouth shut. Thomas probably asked it because of the earlier comment about nuclear proliferation in the ME, in which his response was entirely on *Iran's* potential program - he didn't even mention Israel as a potential cause of a nuclear arms race in the ME. But he's surely well aware of Israel's nukes, and may have (guessing here) only answered the earlier question by referring to Iran alone because the focus - the context of the discussion - was at that moment entirely on Iran.

"Again, I disagree.  Why does Mr. Inhofe support defense spending if he's all about small government?  It's the biggest, most out of control departmental and budgetary black hole in the system.  Why should the government be involved in fighting wars overseas to help big oil companies secure good contracts, but not involved in helping to lower the overall cost of healthcare for everyone with common-sense reforms to a clearly-broken system?  It's because the oil companies are very generous to politicians who help them out, as are the pharmaceutical and health insurance companies.

Mr. Inhofe doesn't want to read the bill because he's scared that the fact that the legislation might actually spend some money for the good of the people, rather than just bailing out Wall St. or buying fancier weapons, might weaken his resolve to just continue on with this bull-headed opposition which is not based on political ideals, but rather on his determination to be anti-Obama, and anti-useful to the citizens of his state.

He's a paradigm of the power-hungry, fear-mongering, god and guns warhawk conservative.  He says he believes in free markets but he knows full well such things do not exist in the United States.  The sole reason he doesn't read the bill is so that he's free to make things up about it without being accused of lying.

"I think you've spoken out of turn. As an active member of the Campaign For Liberty, I get robo-called for money, and I called by live human beings for action items like End the Fed rallies.

There is also growing number of Constitution-quoting C4L members at state and local Republican PArty functions. These operations are ongoing and they are having an effect.  Fox News is running Freedom Watch every Wednesday, and the GOP leadership is starting to sound more and more like Ron Paul every day, and he is the most in demand Congressman on the news.  

We estimated it would take 10 years of hard grassroots work to reorient the GOP back to a Paul/Goldwater ideal.  Considering we've been at it less than a year, I think it's safe to say we're making inroads, and we have a lot to be positive about.  

Lastly, we might be crazy idealists, but we are pragmatic enough to know that building an organization takes money.  Raising that money requires appealing to the Republican mainstream.  But we are idealists and we stand on principle.  We opposed Bush because he was acting as an enemy of the Constitution and of human liberty. We oppose Barack Obama now on the very same principles. 

How can we support printing trillions of dollars in new money when we believe the Fed is at the bottom of the mess in the first place. His Treasurer is Timothy Geitner for fuck sake! 

Obama is leaving tens of thousands of troops in Iraq indefinitely to man the bases and embassy, while expanding operations in Afghanistan, while getting sucked further in Pakistan, while continuing to demand Iran prove a negative, while blindly supporting Israel, while expanding the domestic police state.  

Of course we oppose this man and his policies.  We would have zero credibility if we didn't.  Do you honestly expect us to support this man because he's ""Not Bush""?  We're NOT Democrats! 

Most of us know we are one year into a decade of hard grassroots work and bare knuckled politics, for little or no pay, and at risk of winding up on God only knows what DHS shit list.  So pardon us if we're not getting it done soon enough to suit you.

How did Fox News' war against candidate Obama go in 2008?,1
"&gt;&gt;You lie. Until you specify where ""here"" is, I cannot link to the specific facts proving that you lie. Please, name your country/insurance provider. Until then, your claim that you get **unlimited** medical treatment from any doctor whatsoever is noted. Now tell me where this paradise is.

&gt;I'm in Canada. My insurance provider is my provincial government. The MDs make the medical decisions here, not the government. They don't have to phone anyone to see if its okay to give me a treatment. I'm also not limited as to who I can see. I can walk into any health clinic or hospital in Canada and not worry about who is paying or what treatments they will allow/deny me. **They will not (although I'm sure there is some abuse as there is in any system) provide unnecessary or pointless treatments**. 

You forgot to mention how ""very expensive"" treatments are more likely to become ""unnecessary or pointless treatments"".

See, the major problem with healthcare is that SOMEBDOY has to control costs, and that somebody (whoever they are) will have to do that by denying treatment (among other methods). See [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/8zcna/president_obama_called_it_the_right_question_then/).

I could live with a single payer system IF the decisions on the treatment are made by competing private non-profit using a shared rulebook (which includes open enrollment with any insurance company and requiring insurance companies to accept all applicants). This way, the decision will be made without a direct profit / loss motive - the insurance would be the equivalent of the mortgage servicer, paid for their service but nothing more.

&gt;how do you think the rates are set in Canada... (too long to quote - just used as a topic reference)

Thank you for explaining how the rates are set. Nice to see that doctors and nurses have strong representation. Who represents the patients though ? Unions are in it to represent their union members (medical providers in this case) and the government does not give a shit on what happens to the taxpayer's money.

For example, you note that

&gt;The MDs also get to self-police, determine the number of spots in medical schools in Canada 

You should also add that they are making it extremely difficult (much more so than most other western nations) for doctors from outside Canada to be recognized as doctors in Canada.

Can you say their union is maintaining an artificial scarcity of medical providers in order to artificially increase their standard of living at the detriment of the overall population? I can... Cannot think of another reason for limiting the number of doctors :)

&gt;In any event, the public is very appreciative of MDs and RNs and strongly believe they should be compensated handsomely, which they are. 

Or afraid to open their mouth since the monopolistic healthcare environment allows the doctors/RN's to control the entire market. ""He who can destroy the spice controls the spice..."" People have it wrong - It's not Godfather that has the answer to everything - it's Dune.

&gt;With respect to Medicare reimbursement rates in the US, the hospitals ""own costs"" include the bureaucracy involved with settling the insurance claims, costs which are not attributable to Medicare. They are overstating their case.

And medicare understates THEIR costs by requiring most of their administrative paperwork to be done by physicians.

&gt;The principal metric for a patient centered system is ""Are we doing the most we can for ALL patients"".

That does not translate to measuring the quality of a system by the number of uninsured people for many reasons, one of which is that they get medical services whether they can pay or not. Another being that I pay for their medical services anyway, which artificially increases the per insured patient expenses by basically dividing the total healthcare costs by the insured patients only instead of the total number of patients.

&gt;The systems in place in other countries work better than they do in the US. This is not about ""we are better than you"". This is about ""why can't you guys get it together like the rest of the first world and take care of your citizenry""

Never took it to be that way. My focus is on making sure that the new proposals will make things better, and I strongly feel that they will not.

Even though I know the current system to be imperfect, I cannot endorse change for change's sake, and I'm very frustrated at the large number of people who seem to believe that changing stuff implies it will automatically get better. God knows it can easily get worse if the wrong kind of changes are made.

He is and always has been part of the machine and I don't know why this was so difficult to see.  He was obviously part of the machine in Illinois.  He wouldn't have ended up in the Senate otherwise.  He beats out Clinton and then appoints her Secretary of State?  I'm hoping he brings a hell of a lot more to the table than he has thus far or this is going to be a really tough 4 years.,1

I'm visiting my family for the weekend in my hometown, which is a small, conservative place. My mom was cooking dinner tonight (like I told her she should've) and watching Fox News. I walked by the kitchen, heard some racket and noticed she was watching some idiots bitch about Obama. So, I changed the channel and told her not to watch such trash. She told me it wasn't trash, but I ignored her and plopped down at the bar. I then forced her to watch something on the Discovery Channel about Yellowstone National Park. At least it was educational instead of infuriating. ",20
"&gt; On this issue, ABC and Fox are being most critical (as they should be) while CNN is lobbing softballs for the president.

I don't think that's quite right. Unbiased news sources should ideally aim to report the news as precisely as possible emphasizing the most important and relevant facts in general, not channeling facts through a prism of how much they like or dislike the president (or anyone else) to decide which facts to emphasize. And sensationalism should be avoided outright.

It is possible in this case that CNN thought the other facts in the story were more relevant and important while Fox and ABC just happened to think otherwise. A more plausible explanation though is that Fox intentionally aims to pitch news casting Obama in a negative light while CNN tries to remain impartial.",-1

You might note that a recent report came out stating that, for the first time ever, the number of whites in jail for drug crimes is exceeding the number of blacks in jail.  This is highly disconcerting for Obama.  He must reverse the trend and put more blacks in prison!

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/14/AR2009041401775.html

So far, the war is working great.  Private prisons post bigger profits, CIA gets its black ops funds, pharmaceutical corporations pump out more poison for profit, law enforcement gets more stimulus and budget increases, drug testing companies push for ever-wider testing for profit, the American-granted monopoly on poppies ensure the Taliban can keep fighting us in Afghanistan, and green technologies are safely kept away from the market so that other incumbent industries are protected.

In short, the mechanism for transferring wealth from the bottom to the top is working as intended.  The violence in Mexico?  Obama's being polite to the Mexican people.  Calderón and Obama are actively complicit in the drug trade.  Both working with the drug cartels to make sure they maintain their profits.  The relationship is symbiotic:  the cartels are given a market, and world leaders are given a way to wash their hands of the blood.  Obama had to say something to keep up appearances, but the violence is inconsequential when compared to the vast amounts of money that need to be siphoned.

Don't worry, the cartels will be fine.  Once the old or weak organization are replaced with young upstarts, the drug market will stabilize and investment can once again commence.  New infrastructure for dealing with fences, new funds to sway the feelings of government officials, and new submarines!

Isn't the black market great?  I love the innovation and spirit of entrepreneurship.  It's so goddamn American!

"&gt;Well, from what I have been able to find, they claim that around 50,000 uninsured people die annually (and that is the total deaths of people w/o health insurance)

I don't believe anyone from the Obama administration claimed this.  Prove me wrong and provide a source.  A [study](http://www.harvardscience.harvard.edu/medicine-health/articles/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-lack-health-coverage) I found after a ten second search found similar numbers (45,000) annual deaths could be **attributed to a lack of health insurance**.

&gt;As for the number of deaths of the ""insured"" -- 1.75 Million of the 2.4 Million are people over 65 (had you bothered to look at the chart or underlying data from CDC) -- and indisputably those people are covered by Medicare.

Actually that CDC study lists only death rates by age, race, and sex, and makes not mention of Medicare.  There are some eligibility requirements for Medicare, so your second statement is also false.

&gt;Sure there are -- but the administration doesn't seem to give a shit WHY they died -- ALL of those deaths are attributed to and added into the ""died w/o health care insurance""

Was that some more baseless speculation or would you like to back that up?

&gt;46 million uninsured OR the 50,000 deaths -- both of which I think are vastly OVERSTATED

Why?

&gt;But thanks for establishing that you're incapable of dealing with the clear reality of the resulting conclusions -- it proves out what I have long thought -- that advocates of health-care reform pull numbers out of their ass for emotional &amp; psycological effect and won't ""stand"" by their own figures.

I pointed out the flaws in your math/logic.  It's fascinating that you would take my comment and assume that I'm an advocate of health-care reform, then go on to generalize all such advocates based on an assumption.

&gt;Heck they do it with ""jobs"" and ""inflation"" why not have another go -- inflate the number of deaths per year if you can -- probably no one will notice.

Do they?

I'd have been upset if someone had done this to Bush, too - same problem with insulting the presidency.  You are right, however, and I would be in the minority on reddit.

On a related note,  there was an interview in _Golf Digest_ (this is going somewhere, I promise) a few years ago with Rush Limbaugh, and one thing he commented on was how upset he was when a Ryder Cup team during the Clinton presidency had turned down an invite to the Oval Office.  He said that, no matter who the president is, you should show the office respect - and if you're a public figure and invited to the White House, you go: if nothing else, out of respect for the office.  I'd be curious if he feels the same way on this Wilson/Obama thing.",1
"I'll give you this - I think you're the first person in this thread that's made a truly credible claim about Obama's lack of truthfulness backed up by a solid quote - everyone else is dealing with vague and usually misremembered details.

He gives an explanation for his reasoning [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/25/obama-on-fisa-security-tr_n_109257.html), saying that the bill had changed from the one being commented on before, and depending how you look at it, it either looks like the earlier quote was misinterpreted, or he's doing some serious side-stepping, and I guess it comes down to the interpretation of ""retroactive immunity"" - Obama claims he intended it to be in reference to oversight, which I admit, is something of a stretch.

So technically, I'd probably end up agreeing with you on this one - Obama's administration claimed he'd do one thing, but he ended up doing another. And I'll even go a step further - I'm not happy about it. Personally, I would love to see every last person connected to the Bush administration's lawlessness to be prosecuted in every possible way, and taken to task for their actions in the last eight years.

But the sad reality of the situation also seems to be that Bush has so completely screwed over America that Obama will need to spend every last bit of political capital he has trying to repair it. The Republican party may have lost big in the 2008 elections, but they still have enough seats in congress to filibuster every piece of legislation Obama wants to push. And they may very well try to do it too - they're obstinate and crazy, and being backed into a corner most of them seem to think that the reason they lost so big was because they *weren't conservative enough*.

Undoubtedly, many of them will be tempted to stonewall some of the most important things he wants to accomplish - his big stimulus bill and the withdrawl from Iraq, to name a few. And while in the long-term doing so would be suicidal for a party that's already hemorrhaging after the gaping head-wound that is Bush, in the short term, they would be doing terrible and irreparable harm to a nation desperately in need of these changes.

Any attempt to seek retribution on the Bush administration would need to be handled with the greatest of delicacy to avoid even the semblance of a witch-hunt - preferably any such action wouldn't have any connection to Obama at all (which makes for a strong argument for the formation of an independent investigation panel). The FISA bill seems to key into this as well - Obama's ""No"" vote would have done nothing to keep it from passing, but could have provoked Republicans into their default position of victims of a perceived liberal agenda, and now is a pivotal time for Obama to avoid such a stand-off.

As bitter a pill as I know it is to take, he does need to ease the GOP's biggest fears at least a little to ensure that they don't default to the position of opposition party. Otherwise, he'll be pushing them into a position where they'll be inclined to ruin everything for everyone rather than give any more ground to the liberals.

So I guess what I'm saying is, as far as I can tell, you're right, and on this particular issue he did lie, and it pisses me off. But at the same time, I can kinda' see why he did, and why it may have been necessary.

I don't think Obama is perfect, nor do I seek to make excuses for his actions. However, I try to put them in a greater context, and while he occasionally does things that irk me (his weak stance on Prop 8 being another example), overall I still find myself very satisfied with him so far as our next President.",14

"A few out of many points:

a) First, the solution to the debt *has* to cut spending. Spending and taxes are two sides of the same coin. If we lower taxes now but not spending, then it gets paid back by future generations or by printing money. Major things we should look at doing - cut corporate welfare, cut much of our military spending that is unnecessary, reform Medicare/Medicaid, stop the stimulus spending that has not been effective anywhere it has been tried.

b) I was not silent about spending under Bush. However, with a deficit this year of around $2 trillion, even if Obama follows through on halving it, that's still bigger than any deficit under Bush.

c) Regulation can only do so much. The bigger issue is that banks took risks that they knew would make them lots of money in the short run, knowing full well that government would bail them out when things collapsed. Furthermore, we created excessive liquidity through low interest rates that encouraged this behavior. More regulation could have made things harder on the banks, but it would not have stopped this.

d) Deficit numbers *have* been understated because we don't count certain things - e.g. borrowing from social security. This means that the Clinton surplus is often overstated. Going by increase in public debt alone, it appears to be a matter of whether you count calendar year or fiscal year. There was no fiscal year under Clinton that public debt went down. Debt went down for portions of budget years, but not over the entire period of any single budget.

e) Besides being unprofessional, that very same reporter once called a protester wearing a Bush mask with devil horns and a Hitler mustache a ""Bush look-alike"". Are you similarly offended by this? Are you similarly offended when Olbermann accuses Bush of fascism? All I'm asking for here is consistency. Either the ""f-word"" and Nazi references are fair game for all or fair game for none.

He doesn't refer to ""any"" criticism of the president as racism - he criticizes the man himself for Pete's sake!  He is correct, however, in calling out the overwhelming race-based bias in much of the criticism of Obama.  He also frequently criticizes the Democratic house and senate.

&gt; *...you just happen to agree with his politics so you dismiss and probably agree with his bomb throwing.*

The fact that I agree with his politics doesn't blind me to his bias.  If you'd bothered to read and COMPREHEND my very first sentence you'd see that I criticized his tendency to be overly passionate.  He does back up his arguments with facts - please provide an example of this not being true.  He HAS had some guests on his show who have an opposing view, ***though admittedly this has been rare***, and he has been very polite to them.

"I'm afraid you've got your facts wrong. This is from a recent article written by former weapons inspector Scott Ritter:
""Beware politically motivated hype. While on the surface, Obama's dramatic intervention seemed sound, the devil is always in the details. The ""rules"" Iran is accused of breaking are not vague, but rather spelled out in clear terms. In accordance with Article 42 of Iran's Safeguards Agreement, and Code 3.1 of the General Part of the Subsidiary Arrangements (also known as the ""additional protocol"") to that agreement, Iran is obliged to inform the IAEA of any decision to construct a facility which would house operational centrifuges, and to provide preliminary design information about that facility, even if nuclear material had not been introduced. This would initiate a process of complementary access and design verification inspections by the IAEA.

This agreement was signed by Iran in December 2004. *However, since the ""additional protocol"" has not been ratified by the Iranian parliament, and as such is not legally binding, Iran had viewed its implementation as being voluntary, and as such agreed to comply with these new measures as a confidence building measure more so than a mandated obligation.

In March 2007, Iran suspended the implementation of the modified text of Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements General Part concerning the early provisions of design information. As such, Iran was reverting back to its legally-binding requirements of the original safeguards agreement, which did not require early declaration of nuclear-capable facilities prior to the introduction of nuclear material.

While this action is understandably vexing for the IAEA and those member states who are desirous of full transparency on the part of Iran, one cannot speak in absolute terms about Iran violating its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. So when Obama announced that ""Iran is breaking rules that all nations must follow"", he is technically and legally wrong.*""

How did all of these aggressive, largely unethical motivations result in an invasion and continued occupation?  The best explanation I have heard is the theory given in the book *The Psychology of War : Comprehending Its Mystique and Its Madness*.

Basically, the idea is that 'mythical thinking' (as opposed to observation and rational  thought) makes it possible to engage in activities (wars) that solve the most basic age-old human dilemma: the conflict between self and the group.

&gt; After the needless death of his father, the author, a business executive, began a personal exploration of a health-care industry that for years has delivered poor service and irregular quality at astonishingly high cost. It is a system, he argues, that is not worth preserving in anything like its current form. And the health-care reform now being contemplated will not fix it. Here’s a radical solution to an agonizing problem.

factoids: 

* roughly 100,000 people die of infections picked up in hospitals every year
* Health care costs are out of control. In 1966, Medicare and Medicaid made up 1 percent of total government spending; now that figure is 20 percent, and quickly rising. 
* for every two doctors in the U.S., there is now one health-insurance employee—more than 470,000 in total. 
* In 2006, it cost almost $500 per person just to administer health insurance. 
* hospitals, drug companies, health insurers, and medical-device manufacturers now spend roughly $6 billion a year on advertising. If the demand for health care is purely a response to unavoidable medical need, why do these companies do so much advertising? 
* confiscating all the profits of all the famously greedy health-insurance companies would pay for four days of health care for all Americans.  
* the hospital made much more mney by killing the patient.  Because the man had to spend weeks leading up to his death in the hospital after he contracted sepsis there, the hospital was able to charge a lot more for his care than if it had successfully treated his pneumonia and sent him home in days.
* The Obama administration and Congress are still working out the details, but it looks like this generation of “comprehensive” reform will not address the underlying issues, any more than previous efforts did.


Solution:

* insurance shouldn't be used to cover routine, expected healthcare expenses, any more than it should be expected to cover grocery bills or haircuts.  Much cost would simply disappear if we paid routine and predictable health-care expenditures the way we pay for everything else—by ourselves. 
* Make consumers pay.  Give assistance if necessary, but give consumers the power to choose their healthcare in the same way they make choices on transportation, home furnishings or groceries. LEt people decide whether to have a baby in the hospital or at home, based on all factors, including cost.  Make healthcare a transparent, consumer-driven market.

The result will be innovation and cost-reductions in healthcare, similar to that we see in any modern dynamic market.  As time goes on, companies compete and efficiencies are passed to consumers.

I am the Reddit Man. Help me drive redditers insane this election night:

Posted on 11/04/2008 1:50:06 PM PST by E. Pluribus Unum

I had about 13000 karma points before I started my anti-Obama campaign. Losing them steadily, but not as quickly as I thought.

My comment karma was never very high, but I had my fun driving it even lower. Part of the trick is to delete your comments once your target has been hit, so they can't keep pounding them with downvotes. If I hadn't deleted them, I'd probably have a million negative comment karma points.

I have for weeks been telling them that McPalin is going to eat Obama bin Biden's lunch.

I really believe that is about to happen, and I want to rub their noses in it!

"I don't argue with much you said doesn't mean it's not disgusting and that we don't need to find a better way to do things.  At minimum, terms limits...

I would however argue forcing blue-dogs to vote for something like a public option is absolutely something people like Reid or Obama should be doing.  Especially since the polls were for it and if either if them actually believe in what they say anyway.

The dem winners of those close elections in red states likely aren't getting re-elected anyway so if I was Reid I would use the shit out of them because they won't be around long.

But it's also clear that many do not and are present just to show off veiled threats with pictures of guns or hateful posters against Obama or against anyone who is in any way ""different"". 

For those people who hate, I say there has been no better time to let your true colors show, just remember that people can see ""hate"" from a mile away. Take a look at the crowds in the pictures. There is still a lot of hatred in this country for people of color and for people who are not ""Christian"".  It's shameful. By associating yourself with the crazies, you become one of them. If you accept the hate, even a small amount of it, it becomes yours.

For the people who actually think this is about stopping ""big government"" The first thing you need to do is stop hanging around with the crazy people with guns, religious hatred and ultra-right wing beliefs. Until you do, you are no better than they are and the rest of us cannot tell you apart because ""You all look alike"" to us.",1

"He got it because the selection committee like the change of tone coming out of the administration and want to encourage it. Results aren't always indicative of the prize.

Think Al Gore and Carter.

Both spent lots of time trying to further their causes, while it was a radical difference from anyone else in their respective positions (be lazy, get money for talking, retire, give money to random charities to make yourself feel good without actually championing causes, etc) but didn't really accomplish anything. Global warming is still nowhere near being solved, North Korea is still being a bastard, Haiti is still in turmoil.

While Obama doesn't have results yet, he has improved the worlds view of the US (and not just because he isn't bush, world view of US is up higher than it was before Bush). He also has been fighting for equality and peace since before he became president.

So, while he may not 'deserve' a peace prize based on some people's criteria, it does make sense for him to get it.  The peace prize isn't just about giving people money for their accomplishments, it's about making good people trying to do good things, examples for the rest of the world.

PS, I think you are probably being downvoted because of your 'do nothing' statement without backing it up/for it being false. 'Fighting' for peace is a very tough battle.

PPS, while a lot of people don't support certain wars, the vast majority of those people still have great respect for our troups. The whole ""Support our troups"" campaign was a load of crap, it should be ""Support our troups, bring them home alive ASAP/don't send them off into harms way in the first place."" (EDIT: What I mean by this is that they use that to try to guilt people into supporting the war, but supporting the war and supporting the troups are pretty much two opposite ideas, if you support the war, more people are going to die, if you support the troups, you want them home).",3

I have not noticed ammo going up much in price (if alt all). I got the S&amp;W M&amp;P 5.45 x 39 AR (yes, they really do make one) and I just priced ammo at my local gun shop today. It is still $5.99 for 25 rounds, just like it was six months ago.

"Do you mean they all oppose single payer health care? It's not the same as universal health care, you know. Single payer implies government involvement, while there are some methods of achieving universal health care without government involvement, although there is some debate on how successful those method might be in reality.

Republicans oppose single payer, because they don't like the idea of government involvement. Dems are somewhat divided, with the more centrist and liberal members supporting it (including Obama) while the conservatives oppose it. The confusion comes in because some of the Dems are in very conservative districts, and are fearful of supporting it because of a potential conservative backlash in their next election, while some other Dems are conservative enough that the oppose it for ideological reasons.

He'll also take people's quotes way out of context, so far out that it changes the meaning.  It's hard to respond to that, because often his viewers hear it in the person's own voice.  And it's a difficult argument to make ""Yes, Obama said that.  But in the larger context of his speech..."".

First of all, who the hell really cares who visits the white house, but the point is if they are going to be blocking this, something that ultimately matters very little. They are going to block plenty of things that are actually important to the American people. 

No one trusts the United States Government right now, especially it's own people. Everyone suspects them of doing something sketchy, whether you're a Dem or  Rep.

That is the thing. We are just watching him make the same moves the Bush junta made. Add to the wars his positions on domestic spying, openness in government, and the bailouts and I can't see a single damned difference beyond rhetoric between Obama and Bush.

Rhetoric does not get things done. The science of rhetoric is about convincing people you are earnest. A lot of rhetoric is really about lying frankly. Just lying in an artful, political, and persuasive way. 

What Americans have not realized yet is that they always vote for and are mislead by rhetoric. High sounding speeches make American's go mentally limp faster than anything else except possibly American Idol.

In the world there is rhetoric and there are actions. In an age like this where mostly all we have are lies it seems like to me anyway that rhetoric is of less and less utility. 

Rhetoric is the ropes holding together the wooden planks of lies that form a bridge into a false reality.

The key of the problem is that the system punishes any consumer that tries to exercise choice among multiple providers, adding one extra ""option"" controlled by the government is no real competition and wont hold costs down, no matter what congress claims (just look at the backdoor deal Obama arranged with big pharma to bring them on board).

"Actually Panetta said that given Cheney's comments recently it's almost as if he were wishing for an attack to blame on Obama. That's not the same thing as saying that he does hope for an attack, just that his comments lead reasonable people to wonder.  Over the years many Republicans have said that another 9/11 like attack on the US would be good for the GOP and increase public support of their party just as support rose after the September 11 attacks themselves. Such talk makes people wonder if their motives are more for their party than for the country. 

Cheney claims that Obama stopping torture increases the chances of our being attacked, but the Bush Administration said they stopped waterboarding years ago, so how could Obama’s decision increase the chances of our being attacked? If we *are* attacked again it sets up Cheney for an “I told ‘ya so” situation. Also his “Obama is making us less safe” talk feeds into the unbalanced individuals who have been causing violence and murder throughout the US recently. They’re already unhindged and then they hear Cheney saying “Obama is making us less safe,” so they take matters into their own hands.

"These links are strong evidence that he (and his administration) are doing the opposite of what he promised on a number of fronts. For example, ""Closing Guantanamo"" isn't truly meaningful if the things that are wrong about Guantanamo are kept in the system -- as they clearly are, in the form of Bagram, for example.  And the ""let's not look back, let's look forward"" defense is something no low-level criminal will ever benefit from, but the Constitutional-Lecturer-turned-President is using it to protect criminals at the highest level.  And the list goes on.

Here's what I really think: Obama is attempting to counter extremism with half-measures, half-promises, and compromises with truly evil people.  It didn't work for Chamberlain when dealing with Hitler, and it won't work now.  The military-industrial complex was already too powerful before Bush came to power, and now it has saturated our government and our society to a toxic degree.  We don't need a compromiser in the White House -- Bill Clinton wasted 8 years ""compromising"" with less emboldened Republican thugs, and all that did was keep us in a holding pattern while the extremists waited to take their turn.

And FWIW, here's what I really REALLY think: if America stays on this road -- which can be summed up in the phrase, ""the military solution is the only solution"" -- then we will get in so far over our heads that we will have to bring the draft back, and then the country will really fall apart.  We are facing a true crossroads, where we'll have to choose if we want to be at war with the whole Muslim world, since they sit on top of and around the most important resource to our nation and its military; or if we will commit ourselves to breaking our oil addiction the way we've so far committed ourselves to our imperial misadventures -- spending hundreds of billions of dollars, and thousands of lives.  Think about that while you read this:

Brilliant; he defuses the right-wing defense of ""we need to move on and focus on the future"" by allowing others to pursue the failures of our past. He can focus his energies on helping America (and the world).

"Right, and how many of the total dems are for legalizing marijuana?

"I pull ""inevitable recession"" from the policies of previous administrations. i believe i said this. you yourself stated that the situation took time to get ourselves in to, so i don't see why my claiming that the policies of past administrations left bush in a situation where recession was inevitable is so hard to stomach. I agree - America was in bad financial shape. We are in bad shape now, we were in bad shape ten years ago, we were in bad shape 20 years ago. Clinton's tiny surplus is a joke compared to the vast underlying problems in our financial system. Like I *very* clearly stated - I am not a Bush apologist. Why is it that libs seem to be able to only see the world in red and blue? I realize that this is a defacto two-party system, but it was never intended to be, and saying that I think Obama's policies are shit a) does not mean I support the Republican vision of America, b) does not mean I am a bush apologist, and c) does not mean I even voted for him. These are all assumptions you make based on the fact that I don't care for Obama or his policies. Have you even considered, for a split second, that there might be other viewpoints out there besides what the dems and repubs try to pass off as reasonable policy? Yes - if someone held a gun to my head and forced me to vote either dem or repub, I would be more likely to side with the repubs. That said, they do not really reflect what my value system is all about. That also said, Obama is much further off. 

I think our ""Seeing signs of the recovery"" is another joke. We are nowhere near bottom. If the disaster is entirely bypassed, fine. Good for us. Now we can work on avoiding massive inflation and paying off a staggering debt. You seem to think that I want to see America crushed just to prove that I was right about Obama. This is not the case. 

Indeed, he has only been in office a short while. How long am I required to wait before I can start to freely bash his policies? Should I wait 6 months? 8? Media, communication, etc., has changed radically since Bush has been in office. Everything happens faster now. People want results, it's true, and I acknowledge that the effects of policy will take some time to play out. That said, just because Obama is in some sort of honeymoon period doesn't mean he can pass shit policy and expect the media, voters, etc. to look the other way. He is responsible for any mistakes he makes from day 1. He wanted the job, he should be able to deal with that burden.

My fucked up messiah? Don't take this the wrong way, but are you a high school graduate? How many times have I said that I was not a Bush apologist? How many times have I admitted that republican policy does not reflect my desires for the course of government? Do you have a learning disability? Are you even reading what I write from start to finish, or just catching a whiff of Obama bashing, glazing over, and immediately foaming from the mouth, angrily clicking ""reply""?

When did i claim that Obama's administration wasn't ""providing any change""? Where is that in my comment? Are you even replying to the right person? Yes, of course i acknowledge that he is providing change. I don't think it is good change, though. Again, black-and-white, red-and-blue. You say that either he is ""changing the former administration's cluster fucks or he's not"", which seems to imply that if he takes a Bush policy and changes it, it is automatically good. NO! He can make change that is worse, or bad in another way. This is what he is doing. The frustrating part is his zealot support base even seems willing to ignore the fact that he has lied to many of them on the campaign trail. 5 days of scrutiny before signing a bill into law? Didn't happen. Flipping out about  warrantless wiretapping? Oops - fine with it now. Etc, etc. 

Anyway, this is all a moot point. We'll see where it all goes. I sincerely hope that in 4 years (or 8) we are happy with where we are. I just can't see what is taking place in the current time leading to any sort of future result that I will feel good about. I a) don't think it's going to work, and b) don't like the policy that's being used to drive it. That's all. You don't like that, fine. That's America - we have a right to our opinion and can disagree and move on with our lives. If you reply to this, try an interesting exercise: say something rational without mindlessly linking me to Bush and implying that that, in itself, invalidates whatever I have said. I would like to reiterate, finally, that nowhere have I said that Bush was ""my messiah"" or that the GOP was ""my movement"", or that I ""sided with them"", etc., etc., which would all be you putting words into my mouth because your argument lacks any material otherwise. Also, at no point in time did I say anything about disliking Obama because he was, as you say, a ""nigger"". You have linked me to a demographic of people that I am in no way a part of, because you can't think of anything better to say. That's fine -- again, your right -- but it makes you look like a fucking moron. You should consider the policy that I just don't care for Obama's policy, and that it has *nothing* to do with his skin color, my own political affiliations, or anything else besides the policy itself.

And as for giving the dude a chance.. the media harped on anything Bush did, but I can't harp on anything Obama does? Post-9/11.. ""ooh, why didn't we know anything about these terrorists? Where's our intelligence?"" Post-wiretapping ""ooh, who the hell are you to wiretap for intelligence?"" The media/public/etc are fickle. If Obama can't handle this, he should probably pack it up and head back to a junior office where he won't face so much heat.

"Could it be that Corporate Interests actually are in charge in the United States? And have been for at least 100 years?

If not for the explanation of Corporate Influence the whole plan would seem very strange. 
For instance consider how the only changes the Insurance Companies are asked to make are those they can charge extra for! And how the special exemption from the Antitrust laws they have, which allows legal price fixing are not to be changed.

"Never thought about it this way until you sort of mentioned it, but considering how the Whigs started up as a catch-all 'anti-Jackson' or 'opposite of Jackson' party, we do have a parallel to that now in the Tea Party, this time with Obama instead of Jackson. 

Two important differences though: One is that Jackson and his supporters had the crazy edge and were the angry well-armed rural types, while the Whigs had well thought-out policy and seemed to be the crowd thinking things through at the time. The other difference is demographics, they were the reverse from now; illiterate rural types were the majority of the country while urban pro-development types were the minority, reflected in the built-in advantage the Democratic Party had in this era. 

Based on the two points of difference, I'm skeptical of the Tea Party becoming a major party, thinking the odds are better that they will be co-opted/absorbed into the Republican Party, but that by doing so the Republicans will end up with a Whig-like status as the lesser of the two parties, based on demographics too narrow to win unless the Democratic Party screws up big time (like with the economic crash in 1837, and when they split over slavery with some starting the Free Soil Party in 1848). And both times the Whigs won it was entirely on personality and avoiding the issues; I suspect the Tea Party-influenced Republicans will only find their way into office under similar circumstances.",1

"Bush fired U.S. attorneys and hired ones that signed a ""loyalty oath"" to him. He put his supporters and campaign financiers in positions of power (i.e. David Wilkins, neocon and former U.S. ambassador to Canada.) Put corporate stooges in charge of the FCC, the FDA and other government departments, thus putting the foxes in charge of the hen house.

Oh yeah, approved torture, created a ""terrorist watch list,"" invaded two countries, and exploited the tragedy of 9/11 for political goals.

Not even Obama is innocent: refuses to prosecute torturers, voted for FISA, stealing money from taxpayers and giving it to banks...",3

"You argue a point from invalid assumptions.  Personal liberty is not necessary for corporatism.  In fact, many of the so-called Progressive Liberals you probably favor are in fact the very people who have given us the Corporate Paradise, while the much-maligned Republicans have actually continued to advance equal rights and personal freedoms.

* [Corporate lobbyists write speeches for Democrats](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/us/politics/15health.html?_r=2) (Note that they wrote speeches for Republicans too.  I point this out because Democrats are not as clean as you think).
* [Many Democrats voted against the Equal Rights Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment), which makes you wonder why blacks in the US support the Democratic Party.

* [Republican Senators have introduced a term-limits Constitutional Amendment](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/11/10/senators-seek-to-limit-congressional-service/) that will likely never see the light of day in the Democratically controlled Congress.
* [The Bush Administration proposed a new agency to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac because of financial irregularities](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/11/business/new-agency-proposed-to-oversee-freddie-mac-and-fannie-mae.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print) but was [blocked by Democrats, Barney Frank in Particular](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122290574391296381.html?mod=article-outset-box).  Failure to fix these irregularities was a major factor in the housing bubble and financial collapse.

I could go on, but I'm tired.

The point is that the Republican Party has historically been the leader when it comes to increasing personal liberty and restricting corporate shenannigans.  After all, what's the point of having a business if it can be destroyed by another company that doesn't play fair?  The Democrats have historically limited personal freedoms and increased Corporate strongholds in the name of some perceived good that usually ends up screwing us in the end.  

EDIT:  The Republican Party of today is a joke.  The fact that they [just removed a nearly twenty year provision for abortion from their own health care plan](http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/11/gop_jettisons_a.html) shows how moronic they are.  The party has been infected by know-nothings.  They have no consistent political philosophy and are more concerned about the appearance of family values than actual values.  The Democratic party is high on their own power and will push through whatever legislation they feel like, just as the Republicans did when Bush was in charge.  The Democrats, along with Bernake, and Tax-Cheat Timmy Geithner [have sold us down the river](http://market-ticker.denninger.net/archives/1600-So-Its-Official-IMF-Carry-Trades.html).

"Dude, who do you think is orchestrating this long slow leak?

Answer: Obama

The reason he's pretending to be reluctant to prosecute is because presidents don't go after their predecessors normally.",92
"
Leaving aside the monumental dumbness of the title (and the gratuitous swipe at Obama's supposed birth certificate problems, something that even most wingnuts have dropped, but not these guys) let's look at Real ID for a minute.  

We'll disregard the implications of a national database of every American, and that TIA was also defunded by Congress years ago but has returned once again.

Ten states have passed legislation prohibiting participating in the Real ID program, among them such Liberal strongholds as Idaho, Montana, Arizona, Alaska, Oklahoma, Georgia, South Carolina, and Louisiana.  Many other states have introduced resolutions condemming it, and still more have pending legislation.

So we have this moron's web site with its nonsensical claims on the side of Real ID, and reddit-, and a very large portion of the citizens of the United States against it, and the number of states against is growing.

So who's on the side of America?  And who's on th side of expanding Government interference in our everyday lives?",1
"There's nothing in that article showing that Obama wants people to pledge loyalty to him. You're just blantantly lying and spreading lies now, reddit-man. You'll burn in Hell for that.",2
"Even the article said:
""Some polls show Obama coasting with a 65 percent job approval, but not in Zogby’s tally.""

Yea..., Zogby. The Roll Royce of pollsters. LOL",1
"I am more worried about his inability to tell the truth.  All we can do is hope he did tell the full truth to Obama.  Because if Obama appoints people who will lie to him, it will be Bush all over again.",0
"How do you propose to judge him if not in comparison to others? I like comparing Obama to Bush because it reminds me that we're in the Age of Aquarius (in comparison).

And Hitler killed like 25 million people.",3
"I wanted Cheney and Bush impeached. Personally I don't see any reason to impeach Obama; though I'm incredibly unhappy with many of his policies and the way he's running his administration. 

However, I don't see that the egregious abuses of Bush/Cheney should prevent us from impeaching future Presidents for lesser (but still impeachable) offenses.",4
"His proof was an e-mail forwarded from his grandmother.  But she has forwarded e-mails suggesting Obama is not an American, and clearly he's not.",2
"Dear Karl Rove and his Republicans, No one will buy the shit we keep shoveling out so I am going to post on Reddit and distract the total failure of our party to follow through on a single promise by blaming you and your party for everything, even though we voted for it as well.

"The ""Obama's a muslim"" shit won't fly here but if they have some logical things to say they will fair better. I want them to come here and explain the 8 years of Bush actually.. wtf was that about?

"I don't understand how people can say that we should never have invaded but then go on and say we need to stay there to fix it. The reason we invaded was to fix it (make it the way we wanted). I don't understand why its so hard to ""just leave"".

"**That's fine, I got downvoted on the facts. I'll repost them so you can downvote them again.**
&gt;Really? Did Obama end the war on the Civil Liberties of all the law abiding Americans in all the states which have decided by referendum vote to allow the medicinal use of marijuana as prescribed by a doctor?
No?
Oh, in that case Greenwald must be full of shit again.

You see, civil libertarians, **SUCH AS MYSELF** recognize that the war on drugs is one of the biggest areas where civil liberties are being abrogated. Obama has clearly tried to distance himself from this key battle in the civil liberties war. Greenwald is completely ignoring that fact, and is utterly full of shit.

chicken shit analogy.  Yet another Obama can do no wrong true believer.,-8
"They need to call out the big lies more effectively though. We need to end this ""split the difference"" crap and have them actually report the facts as they are. They could have came out immediately and said that the death panels thing was a lie at the front of their broadcast.

Their usual technique is to use teasers like ""Republicans claim Obama's health care reform has death panels. What does this mean for your family? We'll give you all the facts after the break."" Then after the break they bring a right-wing Republican, a centrist Democrat, and Roland Martin (or one of their others from the stable of worthless talking heads) to blab about the horse race aspect of the body blow the Republicans just pulled off. The entire time the anchor is just going uh-huh and asking questions to set up more pro-wrestling style debate. Maybe the fact that it is false is mentioned, but it is played off as an opinion rather than an objective fact.

If CNN was worth a damn, they'd fact check the claims and actually do special broadcasts just saying what is actually in the bill and educating the public about the basics of the health care reform proposals and what they actually mean. But this will never happen. They are corporate whores that are highly subject to Chomsky's propaganda model.

What we really need is for America to tune into Bill Moyers at the end of each week. He calls bullshit like it is and backs it up with facts. He occasionally tosses some opinion in, but definitely less than all of the cable ""news"" networks. 

Overall, our best hope is that as we transition to Internet TV, cable TV eventually dies off and takes cable news with it. It showed early promise (such as their coverage during the Gulf War), but it has provided no useful services in the last 10 years or so. It needs to die and people need to get their info the network news (which is okay, but not great), PBS, NPR, or the blogs. Hopefully, the switch to Internet TV won't make matters even worse by further separating sane information from insane information. Time will tell.

Luckily, in the background, science and technology are still chugging along, people are becoming less religious, and the battles of social progress are slowly being won. These things can do nothing but hurt extremist conservatives worldviews.

"This is very sad that we have to spell out in law how to determine Natural-Born citizenship.  But now we have to after the Obama fiasco.  The courts keep dismissing lawsuits contesting his N-B status because they say US citizens have no standing to challenge that status.  This will require Obama to provide all the documents needed to establish N-B citizenship just like is needed to get a driver's license or other legal documents.  


He could end it right now by letting Hawaii release the original document of his birth - the long form - not the short form he got a copy of in 2007.  Anyone born anywhere in the world can get a short form in Hawaii during that time.  Only folks born in Hawaii would have a long form.  Why doesn't he just pay the $29 and release it?  Black out everything but your name and birth date and it's over.  Instead he has nearly 40 attorneys shooting down these cases all over the USA.

This law is good news for Americans who love this country and value the constitution that made us great.",1

It's a racial issue.  What would the Republicans have done if a black man argued for legalization of any drug?  Think they wouldn't have portrayed Obama as a drug dealer?

Obama is pretty centrist, and hell, he just got us deeper into Afghanistan so .. way to go there mr. liberal end the war guy. Any sensible bill that gets proposed is turned into a bipartisan pork barrel emasculated piece of shit by the time these bunch of morons get done with it. This healthcare bill if it ever passes will likely be the most compromised worthless piece of shit that will end up helping the insurers shaft us even more than they do now. The fact that people would even CONSIDER anything but trying W for gross negligence and war crimes amazes me .. but people actually want him BACK ! wtf! If Palin wins in 2012 then frankly we should just pack it in as a country as we are ignorant fucks who squandered our world position and strength in manufacturing and technology for short term greed and the fact that we are continually distracted from blaming the government as a whole by wasting our time pretending that either of our two parties, R or D are doing anything for our benefit or the greater good. rant over.",3

Obama is so great I just LOVE HIM.  ",1
"Ok, ask yourself this: why would the African American community support Ron Paul?  Is it because he supports the constitutional right to discriminate freely?

See, that's something Reddit didn't think about.  But you better believe the strategists for Obama and McCain thought about it.  The name of the game is unite as many factions as you can, and forget about the wingnuts if they will cost you move votes then they save.",0
"Someone gets to the core of the matter.  It's not about healthcare or reform at all, it never has been, it's about making Obama irrelevant as a president.  That Obama is starting to compromise shows that it's working.",2
"&gt;Lately it seems that there are a lot of vocal young people spouting shit like ""death to capitalism"" and ""Free Health Care"" without ever paying attention to the potential and probable consequences of such rhetoric.

And nobody actually reads the bills/laws in question. It seems to be common M.O. of late to name laws, political groups and initiatives in an ironic way.

For example, everybody thinks this is going to get free health care for everyone, but poor folks in the US already have access to pretty decent health care. What this is actually going to do is make it mandatory for everyone to have health insurance, as Obama said, like car insurance. I don't know about your state, but if I get cought driving without insurance, I get arrested.

So, it's not going to make things cheaper, it's going to be another defacto tax(a fat one, too) that everyone must pay, and it's going to make the insurance companies richer than ever.

So, this isn't something they're doing ""for"" you, it's something they're doing ""to"" you.",1

"I'm sure Holder has considered all of this more than the people complaining.  I'm not convinced either way, but these are what I see as the best arguments against civilian trial.


We value our rights related to privacy, self-incrimination, access to a lawyer, etc very highly.  If those rights are violated, a judge should throw out related evidence.  


Police are trained to respect those rights (and often unfortunately in how to get around them).  They read us our rights on arrest, are careful about chain of custody of evidence, etc.  So when they present evidence in court, the evidence is allowed if they followed procedure.


It's hard to say without knowing the evidence, but some of the evidence against KSM was probably collected with the aid of military/CIA/NSA/foreign governments who are not trained in US civilian evidence laws and procedures and who do not put those procedures at the top of their job priorities.


If a civilian judge allows evidence after KSM's lawyer makes a valid argument that it should be thrown out, it makes a mockery of this case and potentially sets a VERY BAD precedent for future cases.   Allowing/disallowing evidence should never depend on who the defendant is or what the crime was.


Military judges are allowed to consider that fact that chain-of-custody rules may not be followed in a war zone and you can't secure the ""crime scene"" or stop and collect fingerprints during a battle. (not that those situations happened here, but just an example of the difference in civilian and military courts)  

I'm sure Holder has a case that doesn't depend on tainted evidence.  But defense attorneys can go it lots of directions.  If they can connect untainted evidence to tainted evidence, the untainted will probably be allowed here, but it could look bad (e.g. if legally obtained item B would not have been found without illegally obtained item A)

And who knows where else the defense attorney may try to go.  He should get LOTs of leeway on a capital punishment case.   It's a bad precedent for all of us if he's restricted.  But KSM may want him to politicize the trial or use it as propaganda or turn it into a ""fishing expedition"" for our enemies by calling anyone he can find to testify on our methods of spying.


On a slightly different note, with Obama saying a couple of days ago
*critics will not find it ""offensive at all when he's convicted and when the death penalty is applied to him.""*
it looks like the outcome is predetermined.  That's pretty much the worst thing that can happen to our court system.  (EDIT: prosecutors say things like this all the time before trials.  it doesn't mean the case is predetermined in those cases or this one, it means they are confident in their case.  Obama saying this is no worse than other prosecutors, but since it is a politicized trial, it can undermine confidence in our entire system.  He has backtracked on the statement, but that's exactly the type of damage that this trial had the potential to do many times before it's done) ",5
"This is sad... really. 

The current president ran for office on a basis that he would support and continue to success the war in Afghanistan.

now people (left and right) accuse his of being a tool, a pawn, a liar, etc.

So, let me get this straight; if a person runs for office on a promise he doesn't fulfill, then he is a liar. If a person runs for office, then does what he promises to do, he is unworthy of support.

I've been a conservative, republican-voting American for 8 years... until Barrack Obama. I voted for him. I believe that he was and is a better option for America than a technology-deficient McCain, and a Shouldn't-be-in-public-office-Palin. Now, when Obama needs more than ever the support of the Liberals that voted him into office, those people are handing him to the wolves and calling him a warmonger, while FOX news calls his decisions ""Idiocy"" and ""a plan for failure"".

Liberals, I don't understand you. I support our president, especially now that he's actually doing exactly what he promised to do. He's no longer leaving our military allies hanging, he's no longer leaving Gen McChrystal out on a limb... he's doing what you voted him into office to do. He's ending Iraq, and planning a strategy to Win in Afghanistan. He's supporting our troops, and knows what it takes to succeed. ",93

No, they aren't all racists, but many of them are. It isn't a coincidence that you see no black or brown faces in ALL of the Tea Bagging protests. 

It is also quite telling when you all of a sudden see huge protests once Obama got into office wanting to spend money on the PEOPLE inside the USA, while those people stayed abnormally silent when we spent over a trillion dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hell, those people called that ""Patriotic"", while money to help citizens here in the Homeland is being called Communist and Socialist. Pretty pathetic.

I also did love how FOX created this current Tea Bagging movement, then devoted an entire week or so to covering the festivities. The next week ran a false ad saying only they covered it, which was complete bullshit.

Sort of like when Bush decided to listen in on the phone calls of Americans, despite their being a law against it, he just said ""fuck it"" and broke the law to listen in on our conversations. And of course that illegal policy continues under Obama.

Or is it like when the US gov't wanted to torture hundreds of people, despite their being a US law and int'l treaty against it, the US gov't just said ""fuck it"" and tortured people -- sodomizing them, raping them, burning them, beating them (sometimes beating them to death), using ""water torture"" on them.

It's like that, right?

Sorry, the brainwashed citizens (that's you and me, if you're missing the point) of a gov't of war criminals waging a worldwide torture campaign and multiple wars of aggression has no right to point fingers at anyone else's gov't.

My argument that is it really disproportionate?  While it may be out of proportion in minorities vs. whites, take in case [homicides in NYC](http://projects.nytimes.com/crime/homicides/map).  You'll notice that 90% of homicides (both victim's and perpetrators) involve either African Americans or Latinos.  So as a NYC police officer, it would be common sense to investigate people of those races versus others.  So let's say police 'suspected' or 'stopped' 10 innocent people, 9 being black or hispanic, and 1 being white.  Is it wrong of them to do that? Ethics say yes, but statistics say no.

All that said, in this case the police offers were retarded for arresting a man who could prove that it was his house.  I'm more or less talking about the points that Obama made.",1

*Substantiate my claims? Easily done, and in a convenient summary!*

Yawn… OK. Let’s see..

**REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM: Alito dissented in the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, favoring a spousal notification requirement over a women's right to privacy**

OK. I did a quick search, couldn’t find much. Whatever. 

**FREEDOM OF RELIGION: Alito argued that a student-led prayer at a graduation ceremony did not violate the Establishment Clause.**

Definite no shit ruling here. Care to explain to me how a STUDENT-RUN prayer group violates the first amendment. Not letting them assemble is, in fact, prohibiting the free exercise of religion so those who oppose this group (like the ACLU) are against following the constitution. 

**DISCRIMINATION: Alito argued for standards that would limit plaintiffs' ability to seek trial for race, gender and disability discrimination claims**

This one is just absurdly vague and doesn’t even name a case. Some of the links that I have already posted show Alito deciding on behalf of minorities in discrimination cases. 

**PRIVACY: Alito dissented in a ruling that the strip search of a suspect's wife and ten-year-old daughter was unconstitutional.**

Read the [opinion](http://openjurist.org/361/f3d/232/doe-v-groody) of the court. The warrant said that they were to search “any persons found on the premises”. Drug dealers are known to hide contraband on children, and they searched the girl the right way – a female officer did it with the mother present. 

**DEATH PENALTY: Alito dissented in a death penalty ruling over the unconstitutional exclusion of black prospective jurors.**

He sure did. I have to get going ot the gym eventually. Please read over [this]( http://openjurist.org/277/f3d/261) one and let me know if Alito actually did anything wrong. The ACLU was vague here just like with all of the other cases 

**PRISONERS' RIGHTS: Alito argued that a policy barring prisoners in long-term segregation from possessing newspapers, magazines or photographs unless they were religious or legal did not violate the First Amendment.**

Yet again I spent time looking for the case that the ACLU was referring to. Go ahead and [read it](http://openjurist.org/283/f3d/506/fraise-v-terhune) for yourself and repot the findings back to me. 



http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/25/090525fafacttoobin?currentPage=all

I’m from Connecticut. The first several paragraphs are about a case where the City of New Haven instituted racist affirmative action policies that left people with high scores out of work and people with low scores with jobs. I apologize, The New Yorker is actually putting forth a coherant argument, but since they are taking the wrong stance on the New Haven case I am deeming the article a failure. Please let me know if I should bother returning to it

*If Roberts is an ""originalist"" then I'm one of the Founding Fathers. Souter is an ""originalist"" of the old school, except the GOP was extremely disappointed that his interpretation of ""originalist"" didn't extend back to King George.*

Seeing as how I’m not a constitutional scholar (and don’t you pretend that you are one), I go by cases that affect my interests or me personally. Kelo v. New London was a local case, and I actually live kind of close to Susette’s old home. Her kids lived there until just a little while ago. Souter sided against the founder’s intent in that one. I’m also what you would consider a “gun nut”, but I’m really a fan of the entire Bill of Rights. Souter again sided against the founder’s intent in DC v. Heller. 

*The liberal seats in the court have an agenda, certainly, but I can live with an agenda that doesn't dismiss the rights of people just because their skin doesn't reflect the appropriate color.*

You have no reason to believe that the “conservative” wing of the court is racist. They do, after all, have the only black man on the court. 

*As I said, Obama's controversy was in pointing out what everybody already knew. He probably felt safe in stating the controversy because he was riding high in public opinion, and still maintains higher polling than Limbaugh. He recognizes what the media won't admit: you can't lose political clout for defending what the nation elected you to do.*


He did not run on a “divide and conquer” platform. He did not run on a “suppress opposing viewpoints” platform. You are defending a dirty politician playing dirty politician’s games. 


*He pointed out that Rush's rhetoric has lost the GOP the last two elections. If they keep listening to him, they're going to lose more ground. We've been saying that since 2006. The 2008 elections proved us right.*


Elaborate. I’m not saying that Rush is a great guy or anything, but the Republican party hasn’t been listening to Rush. They did lots of things that Rush didn’t approve of, most notably nominating John McCain to be their Presidential candidate. Stop with the mindless talking points and maybe I’ll take you serious enough to actually read more about the cases that the ACLU vaguely refers to at their propaganda site. 

*Wait...what media source would that be? The entire broadcast spectrum? I suppose now you're going to tell me that the media still has a decidedly liberal slant. Go ahead, say it. You haven't failed to amuse me yet.* 

The media actually does have a decidedly liberal slant. The press corps is liberal, most of the nation’s top newspapers are center-left or liberal, every major American TV news outlet besides Fox News is center-left or liberal. The broadcast spectrum has liberal voices. There are local liberal radio hosts, there is NPR (which I happen to like), and is Air America still around or did they finally give up? Conservative radio, factual or not, dominates the newsradio ratings. This seems to terrify partisan leftists such as yourself who apparently can’t tolerate any form of dissent. 

*I offer you this compromise: we propose to Congress a new ""Fairness Doctrine."" Not one that enforces equal time for opposing opinions, but one that requires rigorous fact-checking for any claim made. I don't care if it's Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, Rush Limbaugh or Barack Obama: if they say it, the media has to check the facts and report those facts. What do you say?*

That would be a violation of the first amendment. 

*Yeah, I'm blinded by partisanship. Tell me more, please.*

You are a blind partisan and I’m getting tired of wasting my time with you. I’m going to the gym.

Senators Snowe and Collins broke ranks and voted for cloture on the stimulus vote, and are suspected to possibly do so again on health care.

Regarding the federal programs for health care, I don't dispute that they are popular, however what is also not a matter of dispute is that the costs of these programs is expected (especially Medicaid) to bankrupt the country in short order.  The cost efficiency is a matter of dispute, and discussing it with you is likely to subject me to another barrage of insults and lame debate tactics, so please spare me.

They get more power by expanding their budget and expanding the number of people who tree up to them.

We really need to be rewarding people on the basis of efficiency, not on how many processes and people they can administer.

He failed to respond to earlier cases where the court RULED he must provide the evidence (by legal definition, admitting to all the accusations).

His sister didn't know which hospital he was born in.

His mother DID renounce her American citizenship to move to Indonesia...therefore renouncing Barack Obama's citizenship.

His step-father DID adopt him and papers have been provided to the media to show that he did take the last name Soetoro(spelling?)...and that his citizenship was DECLARED as Indonesian.

Most experts believe that processing claims through insurers or the government adds 30% to 50% to health care costs.  It would be far more efficient to just give people money to buy this health care than to require insurers process the payments.

Yeah, I'm sorry the previous administration fucked it up... but that's what they did.  Let's pay back the debt, and then fix the country... or do both at the same time.  Right now, Obama is trying only to fix the country -- *by incurring even more debt*.  Forgive me if I'm not entirely on board.

As far as cuts go, I'm not discriminatory.  Yeah, we do spend more on defense than the rest of the world.  That is not okay.  Medicare and social security are going bankrupt.  That is not okay.

Congress is voting on the big energy bill next week. But the latest version of the energy bill would repeal a key part of the Clean Air Act -- arguably the most important environmental law in American history.

There are many a country where that mother and child would have been dead years ago. Ever heard of Darwin? Killed in countries where the buck is the only thing that mattered. 

Poor people in America (especially women and children) have it better than ANY OTHER POOR PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. They're free. They have rights. They are surrounded by PEOPLE LIKE YOU, people who care, people who want to do good in a world being swallowed by greed. 

I'm sorry, I have sympathy for the poor in America. But in no way will I ever be happy handing the the American Government hard cash that I earned, to solve the problems of poverty in America. They've wasted our money too much. Robbed it, spent it, pocketed it aimlessly, with no feeling of remorse or responsibility. And it doesn't matter who's in office, Barack Obama is trying to get in all of our pockets too.

"It *has* only been 5 months.  Obama's used almost that same analogy to describe his legislative goals.  He is not trying to make amazingly drastic changes in course.  He's trying to begin to get this behemoth of say an aircraft carrier to begin to change direction.  For those of us just sitting in front of our computers monitoring what he's accomplished so far, chances are we're going to be disappointed.  

Here's the irony that I see with people's frustration.  We expect him to make all these changes NOW, but the only way he would be able to do that is if he had way more power than he does have.  The fact is, our system of government requires that he participate in the political give and take of a democracy.  That involves getting the majority of 100 people in a senate, all of whom are accountable to a different constituency, and a majority of 435 people in the house, all of whom are also accountable to different constituencies to agree on a piece of legislation before he can sign it into law.  You want Obama to be able to make the change he's talking about?  Get rid of all those pesky senators and representatives that force him to accept legislation that does less than he'd like.  Of course, if that happened, the issue of him not doing EVERY little thing he said he'd do RIGHT NOW, would seem quaint compared to the abuse of power we'd see with an all too powerful executive.  Furthermore, do any of you think you can shepherd legislation through the legislative branch any better than he has?  If so, then I suggest you run for office.  If not, then calm down, and realize that these things take TIME.  

I also understand that we all have our views, and liberals should do their best to urge him to enact their agenda just like everyone else should urge him to enact whatever their agenda may be, because that's the way this country works, but I'm sorry, I just don't buy the idea that this guy is so drastically different from the person I voted for.  I was disappointed with some of his votes while he was a senator, I've been disappointed with some of the decisions he's made since entering office, and I'm sure I'll be disappointed with some of his decisions over the next 4 years.  Anybody sitting here suggesting that they thought he'd be the perfect president is simply naive.  ",10

Ignoring the roll of the Federal Reserve, probably the main cause of the crisis was the repeal of the Glass-Steagall act brought about by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999. 

75% of House Democrats, 84% of Senate Democrats voted in favor of the bill which ended the regulations preventing commercial banks from doing investment banking.

Obama has increased defense spending.
Obama has escalated the war in Afghanistan.
Obama has replaced American troops in Iraq with private contractors who cost more, and who's deaths aren't counted as casualties.
Obama has not ended the practice of rendition.
Obama has not shut down Guantanamo Bay.

House Democrats passed a healthcare bill which provides billions of dollars to for-profit health insurance firms, while prohibiting individual states from creating their own single-payer systems.  The bill also completely destroys what is left of the price mechanism in the healthcare industry by prohibiting the denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions.  Why would anyone buy health insurance if they can get the same coverage if they purchase it after they're already sick?  Does Congress even know what insurance is?  If the bill passes the senate we will have a real disaster as healthcare costs will sky rocket.

With few exceptions, our Democrat and Republican representatives work toward all of the same failed policies. 

As for debunking the Republican economic point of view, it is the same as the Democratic one.  Leadership in each party adhere to the Keynesian school, which says that government spending and government debt can spur economic growth. Each party is doing a hell of a job debunking that myth, as we have record deficits, double the debt we had 10 years ago, all while in what will likely become The Greatest Depression.

If you want to debunk the economic establishment, look no further than the Austrian school, which predicted the crisis in the first place.

His real strong point is his tireless devotion to spinning on behalf of his neocon allegiances.   Palin is seen by Kristol and others like him as someone who can easily be made to do their bidding.   They don't even seem to care that much that she's a total moron (in fact it's probably good that she is a total moron), as long as she has some sort of populist flair that they can see themselves riding in on.

"The argument for what the middle is or whether to country is becoming more 'liberal' or 'conservative' is always full of biases.  Dobbs sees the Obama Administration as more 'liberal' than they are, whatever that means.  Obviously the problem with Obama has little to do whether he's a 'liberal' or not. Both parties generally see the other party as the establishment and their own party as the anti-establishment party.  Libertarian conservatives see themselves as continuing the traditions of the founders by being anti-taxation and pro civil liberties because the founders were opposed to the establishment British Monarchy. On the other side, the liberal democrats also see themselves as anti establishment because they oppose the dirty conservative monopoly men and trickle-down Reaganomics, believing that more taxation is needed for government programs to combat economic strains on the lower class and middle class.  The unavoidable truth is that a two-party system is inherently flawed in this regard, because both parties will inevitably represent the wealthiest people.  I used to be your textbook democrat until about a year and half ago.  I even had hope for Obama before I figured out he was a huge liar and jumped off the bandwagon before the election.

In my opinion, whether Obama is 'centrist' or 'liberal' is irrelevant because the man is 100% an establishment hack working for corporate interests.  In the U.S., corporatism is so embedded in the political system that almost every maneuver by either party is guaranteed to have lobbyists hands all over it.  The Obama Administration is run by Wall Street lobbyists, and Obama follows the roll of a President as a corporate puppet.  Presidents are selected by the financiers that give them tons of money so they can reach more people and win the election.  Obama's number one doner for his campaign?  Goldman Sachs.

First off, it's not *purely* a Fox stunt. I'm not saying Fox doesn't have a hand in it, but even Fox news can't bring out thousands of people if those people don't have some initial interest in the first place.

Secondly, the woman interviewing the people is *very* aggressive. It could be that she is in a hostile environment, as the video description claims (I didn't really see much evidence of that in the video). In which case I can understand the behaviour. But if the video is the worst of it, she was most certainly not behaving like a journalist. Not to mention that the woman in the studio gives her approval of what the interviewer said.

Rather than have your family or your doctors try to guess what you would have wanted, a living will makes that all clear ahead of time.

"Your ""unchecked capitalism"" doesn't work.

At the least, capitalism needs a lot of regulation.

Something better than the US?  Needed, possible, but NOT easy.  

Obama?  MUCH worse.  E.g., he wants to bankrupt the US coal plants (see the 1/2008 interview by the SF Chron. on YouTUBE, I've posted the link here on Reddit several times) to get money for 'renewables', that is, people dependent on him as in Chicago style machine politics.  He has promised that electric rates will ""skyrocket"".  Bummer.

He wants big 'carbon taxes' to 'fight climate change'.  No he doesn't: He wants big carbon taxes to get money and power.

ObamaCare?  Just a grab at Obama machine control, with SEIU, over 20% of the US economy so that the SEIU can do to US health care what the UAW did to the US auto  industry.

Obama is, in part, trying to start a class war.  But his proposals just SUCK, for essentially everyone.  He can do a lot of damage, but he won't win.  He will be bringing the Repubs back in power, even really dumb Repubs.

It IS possible to do better, and we should, but it's not easy, and Obama would be MUCH worse although so far he has mostly just talked or let others talk for him and not actually taken solid positions of his own or done much -- and these go along with a big theme in his career, e.g., vote ""present"".  At  the Harvard Law Review, he was the 'editor' or some such but let others do all the writing and have all the opinions.  For ObamaCare, mostly he is letting Nancy, etc. do the talking.

On issue after issue, he just has NO idea what he is talking about, when he does talk without just reading prepared text.  E.g., at his health care town hall meetings in August, a few times he talked without prepared text and quickly showed he was a total fool on health care.  In response, the US College of Surgeons corrected some of his terrible errors and said his comments were ""uninformed, just plain wrong, dangerous, ....""  Get the full statement and read it.    I've given the URL here on Reddit, but it's easy to find via Google.  The American College of Surgeons is SERIOUS, and Obama messed up big time.  Similarly on climate.  Similarly on the economy.  Same on energy.  

On nuclear weapons, the fool had some sudden eruption from below his belt, which came out of his mouth, and proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons from the world.  We're talking Darwin award with oak leaf clusters, a candidate for the dumbest person who ever lived.  Right away Putin had to straighten him out.  Japan has rockets to the moon, with some of the best technology ever sent there, a great domestic, nuclear, electric power industry, world-class manufacturing, is right up to date on world class physical science and engineering, and, thus, could build a nuclear bomb and put it on a missile in, say, want to count the hours?  Why don't they?  Hmm ....  Obama get's an F on this middle school level policy exercise.   

On Akrapistan, basically he went with some old Bush style policies because he didn't have any good ideas of his own and wanted to kick the can down the road and, thus, stop 'failure' until just after the next presidential election.  So, blood and treasure for nothing better than Bush did.  So, we are sending tens of thousands of fantastic US troops, tens of billions of US dollars, fantastic equipment, lots of 'community projects', and are losing to some barefoot guys with some rusty AK-47s, nothing that will fly, etc.  Hmm ....  Uh, maybe we need to work with some people there who know how to run the place?  The people we are losing to know how to run the place, but there are likely more and who we could get on our side.

Clinton was a big policy wonk, but Obama doesn't know dip squat about public policy.  Instead, he is just after money and power to take the US toward Chicago style machine politics, mostly because that is all he knows.  Oh, and his advice to men on how to take out 10 minutes each week or so and be a great dad.  Oh, and his jump shot.

"&gt; To be fair, my sense is that he has no true economic position, regardless of its legitimacy; he is a politician after all. Since much of what's going on is long on emotional appeals and short on details, one is left fighting a figment and thus has to fall back on basic economic principles, which is a quick route to being branded an ideologue.

My non-doctoral opinion is that, while economics is a critical part of societal function nowadays, I don't believe it should be used as an excuse to justify taking a certain policy.  For instance, I think ignoring pollution because of the potential economic effects of increased regulation is rather unethical at best and, in fact, fairly stupid.  I also think that letting economics decide policy (what many libertarians propose as a serious alternative to the Civil Rights Act, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and so forth) is a mistake.  And in the case of universal healthcare, I don't believe that economics provides any meaningful arguments against the implementation of such a system.

I acknowledge that there are people like Rothbard and Milton Friedman's son (I have trouble keeping all of these damn Friedmans straight) who believe, for instance, that no government function cannot be replaced by a more efficient market alternative.  Since I'm something of an anarchist, I would lean to prefer such an argument.  Unfortunately, I see that the indications from psychology and sociology, as recorded in the news and in everyday interactions, leave me with a less than positive view of the market alternatives.  Other ideas straight from economics, like multiple competing currencies, sound fantastic on first blush but have been tried in the form of ""scrip"" and were horrifying.

Politics is a compromise, of course, and who can afford to have a firm ideology when your position depends on public goodwill?  But Obama might be the sort of person who takes more things than economics into consideration when he makes a decision.  That's what I would like to think, anyway.  Ron Paul doesn't seem to -- which is seen as a great thing by the generally libertarian-trending young tech crowd, but I believe this to be a detriment.  Certainly his disbelief in evolution impacted my opinions of his ostensible Enlightenment mindset... but it was his beliefs on marriage and other non-economic issues that really repelled me.

Also: wasn't the Great Depression immensely worsened by the refusal to bail out banks?  My understanding of the situation is that Bernanke, Paulson, and so forth are free market ideologues who have made a decision that greatly contradicts their beliefs simply because they believe it's the only thing that will work.  This is unpopular in the real world and on Reddit, and I am most certainly not an economist, but my impression has been that the whole bailout thing has been a sincere and informed decision to prevent a catastrophe, not a power grab by the Illuminati/Communists/Whoever.

"Well okay.  Killing granny, rationing and cutting senior health care benefits all fall under the same category.  The gist of it is, is there enough to go around and if not who gets it?  Is there enough?  There's probably just barely enough to go around right now.  Let's look at it logically.  Certainly greed and fraud are big reasons that health care is so expensive, but the number of health care professionals versus the number of people needing them is also an important factor.  This is just high school economics supply and demand stuff.  Right now there are doctors working ER shifts for 48 and 72 hours straight.  The nursing shortage has been going on for a decade.  The economy is in the shitter so less people can afford to go to medical school.  Mant medical pros are in the military and taking care of soldiers overseas.  Boomers have been retiring at 1 every 10 seconds for almost two years now - this both removes retiring doctors and nurses as well as adding to patients.  Yesterday, Obama promissed to pass comprehensive immigration reform by next year - adding up to 35 million citizens.  SO, since the medical infrastructure is already stretched to the breaking point, what will adding millions (like 85 million) to the rolls and also encouraging people to seek out health care who currently aren't do to the situation?  Who's going to decide who gets care and who doesn't, if not some death panel?  Be honest.

As to the other two points... obviously a government subsidized health care competitor will push some insurers out of the market.  That's just simple math.  Sure, there will be some who survive to compete but realistically, they will be for the very wealthy.  In the end, most americans will be forced into a government plan.  How do you send your mail?

And as for bankrupting America... we've been bankrupt for a long time.  There's really no argument there, except that our creditors may think we've gone too far and start calling in our markers.

But, fundamentally, that doesn't mean there was some kind of conspiracy to silence Paul.  He was a Presidential candidate whose views were out of step with 90% of the population.  Frankly, I think the media gave him, proportionally, MORE airtime than any other candidate as far out on the fringe as he was.

Let's say this slowly: you elected Obama because (among many other things which you assumed you would do and he did not do) you assumed that he would hold the previous administration responsible. He's still in Iraq and still in Afghanistan. You will be completely impotent for four more years because of one stupid push of a button. Try not to be suckered again.,1

"All of American history is the story of the Jeffersonian spirit of '76, the individual liberty ideal, the small-r-republicanism, anarchic in its extremes, inexorably giving way to the primacy of the Hamiltonian spirit of '76, Federalism, proto-communist in its extremes, the government-of-us-and-not-them ideal at every turn: East vs. West, North vs. South, Urban vs. Rural, Industrialism vs. Agrarianism...

The reason for this is that the American constitution was largely cribbed from Polybius. As such, it shouldn't surprise us that our fundamental political tension should be the same as the SPQR's. Individual liberty is *inefficient as hell*. As such, as the empires of the SQPR and USA both extended further and further, government necessarily consolidated and centralized power as a practicality. This is why the tyrants of the first century BC didn't really go away until somebody with enough political acumen to ease the civilization into monarchy arrived on the scene (Augustus).

Anybody who doesn't think we've been heading toward monarchy should probably reread *Federalist 10*, or just look at the 8 years between 2000 and 2008. The question is whether advances in technology will allow our country to pull back from the brink and move toward individual liberty again, which is why Obama's speech in Green Bay, Sept. 22, 2008 was so significant, though it may have largely been talking points.

In summation, though, I don't think it can reasonably be argued that a system ""where the central authority's power is minimized"" is ""the one we have now"".",10

"Pfft, if it was the White House vs. the Insurance Companies then Obama would have been pushing for universal single payer.

As it is Obama's odd obsession with ""bi-partisanship"" [1] meant that from the onset he started with a very bad barganing position.  Universal Single Payer wasn't even put forth as a position to be bargained down from, instead he **started** from a weak, watered down, fuck the people, position in hopes that Republicans would sign on.  And then, from his already weak and watered down position, he has let himself be talked further and further to the right.

So now, after all the insane rants from the Right what is left is a toothless bill that is nothing more or less than a giant give away to the insurance industry (""everyone has to give money to private insurance companies, the cheapest insurance you can buy will cover nothing and have deductibles on top of that""), and the insane Right is still screaming that he's a Marxist/Fascist/Traitor/Commie/Whatever.

Hopefully he's learned an important lesson here.  The lesson being ""don't try to be bi-partisan with the current Republican party"".

Unfortunately, lesson learned or not, we're still fucked sideways when it comes to health care because of Obama's idiot insistence on surrendering every principle and objective to the Republicans without a fight.

And, of course, Obama's complete and utter unwillingness to twist arms in his own party on the issue.  He plays the dirtiest internal politics that exist when it comes to protecting incumbents, but won't do shit to maintain party discipline for important votes.  

Which is what I expected when I campaigned and voted for him.  He ain't perfect, and we need to push him as hard as we can to the left just to get some centrist policy out of him, but he's a lot better than Cranky &amp; Crazy would have been.

"I agree, but I think there is also a very deliberate effort on the part of the Obama campaign to make Obama into some sort of elevated being.  It's not just his fans, and I certainly don't think it's his ""opponents.""

They made a lot of unprecedented campaign moves (that paid off).  For instance, the branded candidate had never really been done before.  They sold Obama's face, slogans, and spirit in addition to his name.  They combined this with an optimism that borders on faith, and a political momentum that is necessarily impossible to maintain.  Sprinkle in a bit of pride and arrogance, and I think it was in no small part his own campaign that cooked up a recipe for (potential) disaster.

I mean, look at the Whitehouse's website right after the election.  Big bold letters ""change has come to Washington.""  The Obama campaign wrote a pretty big check, and I think the question now is really whether or not that check will bounce.

To now blame the messiah figure mentality on his opponents ignores the fact that it was not his opponents who put his face on t-shirts.  It was not his opponents who promised radical change in Washington.  It was not his opponents who made hundreds of promises that will now be difficult to keep.

Granted, Obama has a difficult task of managing expectations that he built up during the election, but blaming Obama's opponents for those expectations is not the answer.  Obama is going to need to deal with this himself.",4

If Henry Kissinger was really a staunch Republican, then ask yourself: would he be a special convoy in the Administration of the Democratic party Presidency of Barack Obama?

Here's a video of Henry Kissinger, supposedly a Republican, on the floor of the Chicago stock exchange remarking that the economic crises that was underway was not an entirely bad thing, and that Obama, with his world appeal, was sufficient in bringing about Kissinger's most coveted dream, a New World Order:

Remember: These guys lie for a living. Natural chameleons as they are, they'll act as though they have the interest of the masses while working for their own benefit.

In the United States, you have two major parties, the democrats and the republicans, that pose as opposition when the cameras are on so a corporate media will continue a culture war that is continued by the media brainwashing. The main stream media outlets like Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and so on depend on the antogizing effect of the culture war for ratings. Each Pundit, whether it's Olbermann, O'Reilly, Matthews, or Hannity, will attack the other side to reinforce it's own audience, as the easiest way to draw a crown is to have a fight with an opposition.

On this very site, reddit.com, you will see constant attacks against the ignorant 'right wing extremists.'  Go to Drudge Report, and it's the 'kooky, smug liberal terrorists.'  This culture war legitimizes the entire political scene. Is Barack Obama opposed to George Bush? If Obama was a real 'change' candidate and wasn't a tool of the Military Industrial Complex, wouldn't he withdraw troops from the disastrous Afghanistan front immediately?  But he's powerless to make that decision.  

The University of California is run at the top by a bunch of rich smug people that pose as liberals. I know this because I graduated from a University of California.

One of the best things you can do for yourself is pull yourself out of the culture war and not intake the propaganda from the main stream media.

Here's Dick Cheney, once director of the CFR and a supposed conservative, speaking with CFR chairman, banker billionaire David Rockefeller. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbnpN07J_zg

Rockefeller has written extensively on socialism, and has applauded the work of Mao in socialist China. This quote speaks for itself:

""Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it has obviously succeeded not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose. The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history.""

– David Rockefeller

Amount of people killed under Mao's China: 60 million.

The ideology of Rockefeller, Soros, and the most of these elite capitalists is to use the government when necessary to repress the masses and assist the biggest corporations. The goal s to eliminate competition so there is no free market or any challengers to the top banks like Goldman Sachs or Chase bank, which Rockefeller owns. Their ideology is best expressed by David Rockefeller's ancestor, J.D. Rockefeller: Competition is a sin.
