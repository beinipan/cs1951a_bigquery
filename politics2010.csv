The banks paid back most the money and Obama then used the Tarp money for things that were never authorized such as the auto industry. The Tarp money was only meant for preventing a banking meltdown

Qoute from original comment

""Mr. Bush did sign the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) into law and loaned $240 billion to banks. But those loans are being returned at a profit to the Treasury. Rather than using those funds to pay down the deficit, Mr. Obama wants to use them for new spending. What's more, he has lavished some $320 billion from TARP on car companies, union allies, and pet causes that will never be fully returned.""

"Didn't everybody just bitch and moan when Fox was caught misquoting Obama? So why is it okay now to misquote this guy?

""virtually everybody in this audience"" is what he said. Not ""virtually everybody [in the country]"". 

And if you actually listen to what he's trying to say, instead of non-contextual clips, he has a point. The $200K/year mark and *especially* the $250K/year for families mark is a poor place to put the division line between the middle class and ""the rich"". 

Just who do you think it is that makes $200K/year, or $250K between two? Do you think it's the greedy CEOs that you're constantly railing against? No. It's actually the highly educated. 

The $200K/year mark is occupied almost exclusively by those who have obtained an extraordinarily high degree and have applied it to difficult careers. Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers, Chemists, etc. When you lower the bar to $100-150K each (for a married couple making $250/year) this collection of professions grows even larger. Nurses, architects, professors, dentists, etc. 

These people are not the ultra wealthy that the economically liberal like to rail against. These people are your next door neighbors. The only difference between you and them is that they chose to stay in school longer, or chose to follow a more marketable/lucrative career. Their *good life choices* got them to where they are today. 

For the ""middle class"" (in quotes because I consider these ""rich"" folks part of it) to turn and attempt to single these people out for higher taxes is the perfect example of theft by voting; the tyranny of the majority. ",3

I remember, even before the presidential race really heated up, Obama talking about reining in presidential power, holding people accountable (wiretaps/torture) and ending the stranglehold that lobbyist have on Washington.  Unsurprisingly, none of this changed.

"&gt;I think that you have demonstrated that your grasp of the subject is deeper than mine. You are probably correct about the advisability of taking whatever we can get now and fixing it later. That doesn't change how I feel about what I perceive as being ""sold down the river"". I think that I am representative of a reasonably large chunk of what the Democrats have defined as their base. President Obama won the last election and carried with him enough Representatives and Senators to establish what can only be called an historic advantage in the chambers of our Congress. So, you are going to say ""Well who are you going to vote for? Why should I worry about you voting for the Republican?"". You don't have to worry about that. What you have to worry about is the base not voting at all. They have a history of it you know. Good luck with that next election.

The Democrats will lose seats in 2010 because of what you're saying, definitely.  I don't think it will be nearly enough to lose a majority though.

&gt;As far as being ordered by my government to buy a product from a monopoly. They can stick it up their ......... Well never mind. The way they have it structured now it is cheaper to pay the fines than it is to buy the insurance, so fuck 'em.

Here's the issue with that.  If we want to be able to regulate insurance companies to the extent that we make it illegal for them to deny or vary coverage and premiums based on pre-existing conditions.... then there really has to be an individual mandate for coverage.  If an insurance company can't deny or vary their coverage based on those things, then it makes sense for everyone to hold off on purchasing insurance until they actually get sick.  Something like a single-payer system or universal care of another kind would avoid that problem... but they're not politically realistic.  With the cards we're dealt, I think what this bill looks like is the best option.

&gt;I am not wild about the idea of interstate insurance. It just means that insurance companies will incorporate in whatever state is willing to regulate them the least.

In the absence of strong federal regulation on insurance companies, I completely agree with you.  I think though that the bill puts in place federal regulation that's adequate, so tearing down competition barriers would be good as long as those regulations in the bill make it through reconciliation intact.",1

It also seems that she was very worried about what might happen around the elections and the end of the Bush administration when she gave this talk (2007?) .

Still don't know what you are talking about. What bill was rushed through? What grabbing for power do you mean?

&gt;People have a tendency to turn a blind eye when the faction they support does something and take said faction at their word when they say it is a good policy.

So your point is that the tea party folks are just Republicans who lost the last election, so they are complaining about Obama doing what Bush did. Which would make a tiny bit of sense except that Obama is doing less and these people are frothing at the mouth and talking revolution. No, that is not the normal response to losing an election. So you have yet to explain what matters here.

&gt;Also, Bush's most egregious policies were largely in regards to law enforcement, foreign policy, etc.

And other than health care, where we know what lies are spread, what new egregious policy has Obama followed that they object to?

&gt;So far, yes. Many of the newer policies take years to kick in.

So they are not actually complaining about actual tax increases.

&gt;They also lowered the ceiling on what is considered Middle Class, resulting in many upper-middle class people paying a lot more.

Please be specific here. What was the old and new ceiling?

&gt;The basic platform is that all taxes should be lowered. Thus, even if the majority of Americans have seen tax decreases, people who are against any tax hikes are going to be upset.

So by saying they are objecting to tax increase you mean they want them lowered even more. 

&gt;Increased taxation is a huge part of that in their eyes.

"Where in the article does it say accused of?

It doesn't. And the jury trial is not the one and only purveyor of truth in the world.

This isn't like someone being accused of robbing a bank, or stealing a car, or even of murder. People end up on this list because there is evidence of their actions; such as photographs of them at meetings, voice recordings, and emails attributed to them; otherwise we wouldn't want to kill them. It wouldn't be worth the million dollar cruise missile or seven man seal teal it takes to get them.

Sitting in a known terrorist training camp and not being a prisoner, is de facto worthy of being stopped through force.

You are applying civil law and civil standards to military engagements in a combat zone. Say we are in a war against Iraq, and we're targeting an Iraqi bunker. Well we're allowed to do this, because its a war and its an Iraqi bunker. We don't need to go to court to prove it, and get a jury to authorize a cruise missile. A field commander says fire.

What this order forces the military to do, is say ""Oh, there's an American in there, lets check with Obama"" and then they check with Obama and they know its that Shiekh from New Mexico who's been aiding them, and Obama goes, okay blow it up. Now replace Iraq with al-Qaeda or whatever other name you want to give a particular terrorist cell, and you get the idea.

This is not about civilian justice. This is not about top down selection of targets; this is about pre-clearance of a target as being an enemy and being allowed to be targeted by the military. This is expressly within the authority of the President of the United States and outside the purview of the court. If the guy were on US soil, it would be different.

Dissenting actions of a military nature outside the US are in fact subject to capital punishment as the entire basis of just warfare is based on the concept of using force to prevent another entity from achieving an objective (particularly when negotiation is either unavailable, impossible, or at an impassé) and our constitution allows for the denial of due process in capital cases during engagements with the land and sea forces (5th amendment). What you are arguing for is pacifism or some form of non-lethal warfare.

You do not need to try enemy soldiers if you are stopping them from acting against you (you can capture if they surrender, but if they keep fighting you sometimes the only way to stop them is through termination). A US citizen is not absolved of ever being classified as an enemy combatant just because he is a US citizen.

The distinction is that it is not on US soil and it is carried out by the military and not a law enforcement or civil agency. The check is the Freedom of Information Act and the right to sue the government on behalf of the estate of the assassinated that the government was wrong in its decision. The check is that the NCA (national command authority) can be held and tried civilly for murder, negligence, or war crimes.

That this is out in the open is actually much better than most of what JSOC has been doing for years, which is totally secret, totally covert, and not even responsible to the President and NCA.

You're living in a dreamworld where authoritarian attacks based on political will or retribution are carried out on american soil by members of the military or civil forces — which is illegal by Posse Comitatus and/or due process.  This is not what these orders are about, and you're nuts for construing them that way.",-1

"I disagree with most of the stupidly posted on /r/politics, but I have to agree here, the case against the Mosque near ground zero is probably one of the most anti-American arguments I've heard in a long time.

I was personally affected in 9/11 - I was born and raised in Connecticut, knew a handful of people who were killed in the twin towers, visited the site weeks after the attack - and I am appalled by the people saying the Mosque shouldn't be built - so I dare one of you anti-Mosque loons to challenge me here.

Freedom of religion is the basis of our society, right up there with freedom of speech. Our country was built specifically to be a religious nation run by a secular government. We have no state-sponsored religion - and for good reason. America was designed so that people are left alone by the government and are able to control their own lives as much as possible, free of interference and prosecution.

Banning a Mosque is terrible. Just because it isn't your religion, doesn't mean it isn't protected by the Constitution (yes, the same document which many people point to when they criticize Obama and his administration). Muslims have the same rights to freedom of religion as Christians, and thus they have the right to build their Mosque wherever they want.

Anyone consider the fact that maybe Muslims want the mosque so close to be a reminder to their followers the dangers of what happens when they become too extreme? Or when they fall into the traps of extremist thought? Perhaps they are building it as an honor to the fallen, as sort of an apology, or remembrance. Like the holocaust museums in Germany. A sore reminder that they too are not infallible.

The loons claiming it ""pokes those who lost loved ones in 9/11 in the eye"" are no less extreme then the pilots who flew the planes into the towers to begin with. I was directly impacted, and I don't feel poked in the eye. I feel you loons are poking me in the eye by trying to justify a blatant disregard of the Constitution.

A-Anansi

As I Socialist I've spent quite some time addressing the misuse of the term and related concepts. While I laude the author for his attempt to clear up the matter, I'm afraid his conclusions are somewhat....lacking.

&gt;The first thing to point out is that socialism, communism, and Marxism are mutually exclusive.

No, they're not. Mutually exclusive means that the outcome of one particular system cannot exist while the other one does. Any Socialist or Communist society that coincides with the Marxian conception of Socialism/Communism would inherently contradict the notion of ""mutual exclusivity"" in this respect.

&gt;They're similar, but not identical or interchangeable concepts. In socialism, the government controls the production and distribution of goods, while citizens are free to own property.

The Socialist Left is an extremely diverse political that fosters a multitude of contrasting and often conflicting conceptions of an egalitarian society. While there is a particular brand of Socialism that fits the description you supplied above, there are also numerous other ones that are fundamentally different than your description.

&gt;Marxism is a little more complicated to explain, but reading up on it will reveal that it isn't so much an economic system as it is an economic philosophy.

No, no its not. Marxism was the early seeds of what would later become the field of Social Theory. Marx does not lay out the basis for alternative economics nor does he go to any particular length to explain how a communist/socialist society would actually work politically. Rather the vast majority of his work is devoted to analysizing the development of Capitalism and its relationship to society as a whole. Marx was one of the first philosophers to look deeply into social relations and bring together various disciplines to better understand how our world works in a uniquely social manner. It is precisely the lack of solid theory behind his work that has produced such wildly different ""marxist"" experiments. Marx never intended to have his work serve as the basis for a future society, rather he intended it to educate the masses to the point where they could design their own society. He believed that basic trends in history and the fundamental flaws in the Capitalist system would ""encourage"" the people to build a society that had certain traits. Socialism would be something that was created organically, not through the uniquely 20th ideological conflicts that were unfamiliar to people like Marx.

&gt;One argument I always raise against the socialism proposition is that of the police, which I discussed at length in a past article here.

This is by far one of the poorest counterarguments a person can make. The problem with the ""Barack Obama is a Socialist"" argument is not that it criticizes government action but rather that it proceeds along a false line of logic that has been reinforced by decades of cold war rhetoric. When you say ""Well the Police/Fire Department/Schools/Roads/Public Utilities are Socialist too!"" you're not disproving or rejecting your opponent's argument - quite the opposite. You are accepting their logic as totally valid and instead arguing that Socialism doesn't always result in bad things. By doing so you've fundamentally vindicated any misguided soul, as the argument has gone from ""is Barack Obama a Socialist?"" to ""is Obama a good socialist or a bad one?""

The solution to that argument is not fighting conservative ignorance with liberal ignorance. The solution is to genuinely understand what Socialism is and what Socialism is not. The police station is not Socialism. The fire department is not Socialism. The roads are not Socialism. A Single-Payer system is not Socialism. These things are nothing more than variants on the general principle of social welfare; that there are circumstances where a communial effort is more practical than an individual one. Since the beginnings of recorded history we can find examples of governments leving taxes for social projects and money being pooled together for public programs. To suggest that a society that embraces these things is essentially socialist is to basically render the term entirely meaningless. Welfare programs are exactly that - Welfare programs. They can be used by Fascist societies, Theocracies, Monarchies, Republics; in economies that centrally planned, market-based, Feudalistic, or slave-based.

"I just came across this article 20 mins ago:

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/business/economy/08leonhardt.html

It's actually pretty interesting:

&gt; And left-leaning policy experts said the package did more to create jobs than they had thought possible after the Republicans’ midterm election victories. Robert Greenstein, Lawrence Mishel and John Podesta — who run prominent Washington research groups that range from liberal to staunchly liberal — all offered praise for the package. Of its estimated $900 billion-plus cost over two years, roughly $120 billion covers the high-end tax cuts and the estate tax cut, $450 billion covers Mr. Obama’s wish list and $360 billion covers the tax cut extensions both parties favored.",1
"&gt; don't get me wrong, obama could clobber bush in a head-to-head stand-up contest, any day.

I would pay so so much money to see them do this.  No writers; they have to come up with the material themselves.",1
"I suggest that rather than reading all those CW ""Romance"" books, you go to a library and actually read some editorials and commentaries of southern newspapers from that era.  You can find a sprinkling of that via google.

Hint: The shit you hear about Obama today is tame compared to what the enlightened south was saying about Lincoln.",4
"If the Obama Department of Justice was in charge of the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials at the end of WWII, not one Nazi would have been charged - 'The accused merely made errors of Judgement, the Holocaust was a simple policy mistake.""",1
"No matter what your opinion of Obama's policies, calling him an ""idiot"" just makes *you* look stupid.

Agree with him or disagree, he is clearly very intelligent.",2
"I would sooooo love a President Matt Santos. :-)
lmao. 

He was so much better than the idiots we had running in 2000-2004. 
Thank god Obama came and showed when having some balls could do.

BTW, for those unaware, here in Ohio Our chairman Chris Redfern got some attention for calling Tea baggers ""fuckers"". 
He actually had the balls to not back down from it. I'm proud of him for it.

He's got a swear jar fundraiser going, and deserves every dollar. 
Help him out!  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/22/chris-redfern-tea-party-fuckers_n_735537.html",1
I sure am loving the reduction of the PATRIOT Act and the closing of Guantanamo and the end of warrantless wiretaps and the national health care Obama gave us!,2
"Considering the Democrats had control of both houses of Congress as well as the Presidency, please explain how the Republicans could ensure jack shit. 

The only thing the Republicans can do is spin the truth and slant issues to make it appear as though the Democrats didn't accomplish much. The Obama administration was capable of doing whatever it wanted these last two years and it squandered a lot of that opportunity. At least Obama took some responsibility and stated that Democrats needed to do more instead of just blaming Republicans. ",1
"It is called freedom when a bill is passed and the president has signed it and then subjected to judicial revue. None of this has happened yet. So before you start bitching about how much Obama sucks, why don't you wait for that wonderful system established by our forefathers has actually happened.

Or is that only for laws you agree with?

By the way..., it was that wonderful Liebermann that proposed it.
",1
Sad but true. I am so sick of people not giving Obama the credit he deserves.  Really bums me the hell out.,2
They don't show the part where Obama torches health care and the constitution.,-12
"Okay here's the thing.  Both parties routinely rotate who is the bad guy that takes the heat on something that is politically very unpopular.  Because of the Senate rules one person can hold up a bunch of shit.  So the GOP drew straws and picked Bunning to hold up a bunch of legislation, freeing other GOP senators to look magnanimous while they pretend the whole thing is ridiculous.  As a bonus Bunning isn't running for re-election.

The same is true for democratic senators and Obama.  They don't *really* want a public option to pass (since they're busy cashing checks signed by the insurance industry), however they know it is incredibly popular with voters and can't say as much.  So they kind of juggle who's going to hold it up and be the rotating villain.  It kind of vacillates between people like Ben Nelson, Mary Landrieu, and the current arch-villain Jay Rockfeller.

Right now Bunning is acting under FULL support by the GOP (though they'll protest to the contrary).  It's just politically very ugly if all GOP senators were to show their true colors.  Same with the Democrats.",5

"The author points out unemployment went from 7% to 10% after the Stimulus Bill was passed, and then blames Obama for not stemming unemployment?  Grasp of economics:  fail.

The author complains that the executive order prohibiting overseas funding of family planning was rescinded, calling it abortion funding.  Partisan politics:  success!

I had to stop about there.  It was pure wingnut ranting through and through.",1
"I see what you're getting at, but does the fact that he delivered on some make it any better than he didn't on others? I understand that things get in the way of some of these promises, but isn't it still a bit disingenuous to make promises like this knowing good and well that it's not as simple as simply getting elected?  

And this isn't just a problem with Obama, it's a problem with the nature of politics.  ",3
"&gt;Sure. Just not the ""instant"" you buy a house.

Yes, if you want to.  If you lived there for the first 20 years of life and move back after another 20 to run for office, what is the problem?

The problem is people like harold ford and alan keyes.  Harold Ford is just looking for a weak place to run and Alan Keyes just moved to illinois to run against Obama in the senate.  I doubt he had even been in the state before that.",1
"Any lunatic Teabagger that gets into office tomorrow only has apathy to blame. The Dems have more registered voters...by 4-7% more...but ""likely"" voters.....the lead switches by a margin of 4%.

I think given the reality on the ground, the obstruction they faced every bleedin' step of the way....I think Obama has done a masterful job of turning this country around. The economy is getting better, we did not go into the depression that some Republicans were hoping for.  There isn't the insane whiff of fear that the Bush put out to give cover to his 'war of choice'....every 30-45 days with a new ""crisis"" in the ""war on terror""...

The Obama administration has done an honest accounting of the war, passed healthcare and financial legislation that has many positive aspects. Maybe we didn't get everything we wanted...but it is a start.",1
"No, spouting off theories saying that Obama is secretly a terrorist sympathizer in the White House makes one a little nutty, especially in a thread about an article that doesn't mention him.

There's also a big difference between:

1. arguing that all religions should/shouldn't have the opportunity to peacably gather and worship wherever they choose so long as they have the legal right to do so (Muslims at a location near ground zero); and

2. arguing that the state should/shouldn't allow non-profit religious institutions to publicly endorse a political candidate and still recieve certain tax benefits as a religious organization.",1
"I thought the Dems passed laws, and Obama utilized his executive authority, to crack down on tax fraud. I'm also fairly sure that there were measures to cut down on Medicare fraud.",1
"Obama's healthcare plan isn't about providing a basic level of healthcare for everyone.
It's about finding new ways to make younger workers pay ever more of their income to keep the elderly alive a few months longer.",1
"*Again - if you actually read my remark* Who said anything about Obama?  

Anyway, keep dreaming...",1
Bush can do no wrong; Obama can do no right. I think I got it.,4
"It's hoped a leader with balls will arise from the Democrats soon because Obama is extremely vulnerable after two (2) years of capitulation to Republicans.  A leader who can't lead his own party isn't a leader.  

If you want to see a Democrat who could get things done, look no farther than Lyndon Johnson.  He was misled and mistaken about Vietnam but that does not besmirch his extraordinary domestic legislative achievements. ",1
"&gt; So the 600,000 jobs that were lost in the month that Obama was sworn in was his fault?

Yes, they were lost because businesses knew what it meant to have him in office.

&gt; The war in Iraq that cost over a trillion dollars was Obamas fault? 

He voted for it during a time the senate was controlled by the Democratic party. Not directly his fault, but he has continued it and expanded wars in other places. Price of wars has gone up not down since he has been in office.

&gt; The deregulation of the banks that led to their collapse was Obamas fault?

Do you mean the deregulation that [Clinton did](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley_Act)?",-5
"I din't know that he's doing nothing. On one hand I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but on the other, maybe this just isn't on his radar. Also, it would probably be political poison in this current political climate where the Right is getting extra support to oppose this too vehemently. I can see the headlines: OBAMA MAKES AMERICA LESS SAFE BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR TERRORISTS TO BRING BOMBS ON AIRPLANES.",1

Maybe instead of screaming and crying any time someone opposes your Messiah president you should question what the fuck has gone wrong with this administration where the right is able to get away with calling out the president on backpedaling on his transparency promises.  That would take introspection and reflection though, much easier to throw shit at the guy wearing the other team's jersey.  You and Obama supporters with a similar mindset are the definition of moral cowardice and why I am quite frankly ashamed to say I was dumb enough to vote for the man in 2008.",1
"He was just saying that Obama is like Will Smith.  He can speak like he's white, but can also turn ghetto on when he wants to.",1
Obama has a telephone call with every single cop in the US first thing every morning.,4
"I love that you put this together, and it isn't just with Obama that supporters complain that they aren't doing anything. Every president has this moment and 5 years from now Obama will be known as the president that got Healthcare started. However, specifically with Obama I think it's the things that he hasn't done that people are angry about. [Here](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/browse/) is a great list of what he promised during his campaign and what he has done about it. 

P.S. One big thing that he hasn't done though is get rid of Guantanamo Bay which he will always take shit for considering that he has continued to allow it to remain open even when he said it was a travesty and should be closed immediately.

This depression (that's what it is, call it one) was caused by poor economic policy by the Bush administration. And who was the 700 Billion dollar bailout passed by? BUSH. Not Obama as the right wing so often claims. In the last ten years, the rich have become richer, and the poor have become more poor.",8
"When Bush was in office his people just did shit, and they would have their lawyers justify it regardless whether it was right or not.

Obama seems to not want to just do shit and is using the ""constraints"" on the Executive branch to hold him back.

He could just have his people walk into the office of BP serve them notice that they are in receivership of the United States Govt. their Board of Directors is dissolved, their listing on the stock market revoked, and any and all Executives terminated with no compensation.

Then he can do whatever the fuck he wants, and let BP challenge it in court for 20 years, not let the poor fucking families who will loose everything challenge it in court for 20 years.

Obama step the fuck up man.",5
"&gt;Disagree? Show me the case of one prisoner who has been systematically tortured under Obama.

Sooo you admit he is continuing a long line of presidents' actions but believe he says I don't and he dosen't?  Is that like the fact that he will stop attacks on privacy (Internet wire taps) and he will cool the war effort (More drones used in Pakistan that Bush).

Sure, the right went after Clinton, but they also weren't showing up at his rallies with semi-automatics either.  There's a distinct difference in the amount of vitriol hurled at Obama that I attribute to race.",2
"&gt; As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In August 2005, he traveled with Richard Lugar to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan. The trip focused on strategies to control the world's supply of conventional weapons, biological weapons, and weapons of mass destruction as a first defense against potential terrorist attacks.[37]

This is indicative of nothing. It is relevant to nothing. It is a big fat waste of everybody's time. Again I remind people of Obama's ""57 states"" gaff. Simply a slip of the tongue, not a sign of intellectual paucity. If you want to criticize Sarah Palin, do it because she thinks global warming is a myth or because she thinks ANWR has more oil than the entire Middle East, or because she honestly thinks you can simultaneously have abstinence only sex education and low abortion rates. Not because she made an oopsy on the radio. If this is the kind of fluff we use to criticize her with in 2012, she will stroll into the White House like a queen.

Obama's Presidency so far has been the perfect antidote to what you just wrote.  He motivated millions of people to do something positive, then shortly after being elected he took actions that discouraged almost all of us.

You can say that he had no choice but to take these actions, and that may or may nor be true -- I'm not getting into that at the moment.  But the facts remain that millions of people were motivated and excited about the new government in 2008, but since the beginning of 2009 that enthusiasm has plummeted.  Most of us are more discouraged than before.  In that regard, Obama has done a lot of damage to the hope of a citizen-led democracy.

EDIT: To clarify, I'm not saying that Obama has done a bad job.  In fact, I think he is the best President we could have hoped for at this time.  But he absolutely fed the idea that his election would mean a huge change in the country, and this is an idea that was doomed from the outset.  One person, even the President, is not going to change things all that much, unless he's a near-totalitarian like Bush.  And if what Obama *does* is worth little, then what he *says* is worth even less.  All this excitement about his great speech is just setting people up for more disillusionment in the very near future.",1

Ron Paul: Why I Voted Against Giving Subpoena Power to Obama’s BP Commission

http://www.ronpaul.com/2010-06-24/ron-paul-why-i-voted-against-giving-subpoena-power-to-obamas-bp-commission/

Stuart Varney: Now, you voted against giving subpoena power to this commission. But, as you know, in the past, the commission that looked into Three Mile Island, and the commission that looked into the assassination of President Kennedy, did have that subpoena power. Don’t you think that this oil spill rises to the level of requiring teeth; subpoena power?

Ron Paul: Are you sure those commissions were set up by executive order, or could they have been set up by the Congress? Usually these commissions are set up by the Congress. My objection is to the process. I am very concerned about giving the executive branch too much power. If the Congress had set up the commission, that would have been a different story. But this was done by executive order and it is a blank check, and I just do not think that is the process. We should be very, very cautious of giving subpoena power to Congress or to a commission.

Stuart Varney: I know you’re also concerned of the people who are on that commission. **Because as you can see – we’re scrolling it up on the screen right now – most of them are environmentalist. I don’t believe there is a driller up or a serious oil person on that commission.** But, again, to return to your point about executive power, overreach maybe. Again, doesn’t this rise to the level of such a disaster, that maybe the federal government really has to just get in there and do it?

Ron Paul: Well, that’s generally the case in this city; whenever there is a crisis, it’s always so great that you have everybody rise to such a level, that you can put aside the Constitution. This is a time when you should be particularly protective of the Constitution, whether it’s 9/11 or whatever. Just look at what we did after 9/11 with the PATRIOT Act and other things. I think we go to fast. Sometimes we even go to war because it rises to a certain level. We went to war against Iraq and Afghanistan without a declaration of war, because people say, “It’s an emergency, weapons of mass destruction”. So we should be very cautious. We can work this through, but to reject our rules and reject the process I think is a very dangerous precedent to set.",-1
"Once Obama is out and, let's say, a Repub is elected prez then the left will attack him just as the right attacked Obama. The left will use the same tactics to thwart change and the Repub prez will be rendered impotent, just as Obama has been rendered impotent. So we'll have this chaotic back and forth as bipartisanship takes the reins of American politics and pretty much destroys it. Meanwhile we, the people, will continue to languish as things will continue to worsen for America and the world at which time, just when it seems that things can get no worse, a lone figure will emerge on the world stage. Someone who will give hope to the people of all nations. The end will be at hand. People mock the Christian prophesies but if you look around, you see how it is unfolding. Economic calamity is, right now, still a very real possibility. Economies will collapse. Things will get worse. People will yearn for some kind of salvation, something to turn the tide. Someone will emerge and become a beacon of hope and sanity, he will propose a unified world currency, thus the beginning of the end. It's coming. Mock all you want, the end is approaching. ",1

Whether you think it's funny or not, and whether you think a lot of people might not recognize it as one or not, I still consider this a joke.

In fact, it was used as a joke by the NJ Teachers' Union shortly before the Obama Facebook page against [Republican Governor Christie](http://www.redstate.com/aarongardner/2010/04/09/teachers-union-prays-for-gov-christies-death/). It was a joke against Christie, it was a joke against Obama.

"Your view of ""fuck them all"" is too simplistic. There are genuine policy differences between Democrats and Republicans. Although, I do agree with you on the idea that both sides are corrupt. However, voting for a third party just to ""shake things up"" is not the best solution. If I've hired two electricians to fix my house and both have screwed it up, the correct solution is to do better research when hiring an electrician. The correct solution is not to hire a gorilla to do it. 

Obama has not delivered the reforms that I have hoped he would. I don't know if this is because he is genuinely moderate or because of the realities of the American politics. I'll give you this. Remove the corrupting influence of money on politics. Politicians will vote for the interests of corporations and the wealthy so long as their campaigns depend on contributions and ads from those entities. Those interests don't always align with the interests of the American people. Even a third party, once in power, will attract the attention of said corporate and wealthy interests and begin catering to their needs. I am not anti-business; capitalism is necessary. Capitalism creates wealth, and I am a direct beneficiary. I once agreed with raising the corporate income tax. I am now not so sure. However, when politicians spend most of their time consulting with corporate lobbyists and fundraising rather than consulting with scientists, engineers, economists, and policy experts, we have a problem.

Everyone means everyone, every single human being on the face of the planet deserves a baseline standard of living. Unfortunately, the United States cannot provide this for everyone. The United States should, however, provide this standard of living for everyone legally in the U.S. For those who arrived illegally, it is with a heavy heart that I would deny them this. While they did break a law, I see nothing morally wrong about wanting a better life for yourself and your family and then doing something about it.",1
"Just the word Obamacare sorta sets me off. Its been used as a derogatory remark so much that it makes you forget what it really is: an attempt to provide affordable healthcare to people. You might not be a fox zombie, but you sure speak like one. If Republicans in the senate actually worked with the democrats, then maybe they would have cut defense spending or had some ideas on how to pay for it. As it is, ""Obamacare"" is better than the system that was in place previously and will save more money than the old. As it is, Dems put in over 50 measures that Republicans clamored for and they still voted against it. In Washington, its about getting reelected first, governing maybe 2nd. The only thing I hear out of republicans is ""cut taxes and cut spending"" -How the F do you do that when you put us into two wars and took a surplus into a deficit??

"If you actually listened to conservative talk radio in the US you would know that both views are vigorously debated daily. Some radio hosts are extreme and their ratings are lower than the moderate conservative hosts. This is the market at work. I disagree that conservative ideals are unreasonable. I believe Germany's ideals on the topic are unreasonable for America, although they seem to work for Germany. Perhaps this has a lot to do with the size of Germany versus America. Or maybe the fact that America basically rebuilt Germany from the ground up after WWII with billions and billions of aid. Not to mention that America has been paying to protect Germany for the last 65 years forgoing Germany having to pay for it themselves. This things just happen to be left out of the article and your comments. 


Every thing you had to say about the original post presupposes Germany's position on the topic is the correct position. You are biased and do not seem to understand the ideals the conservatives in the USA hold. This does not surprise me, however, I do understand Germany's reasoning behind their position. Why you do not go through the effort to understand the conservative movement's ideals befuddles me. Perhaps it is so foreign to you that you cannot understand it. 

The reason I say you do not understand USA conservative ideals is because you say ""...have no interest in doing anything for the good of anyone but themselves"". Do you understand that America was founded on and has thrived on the ideals of liberty and personal responsibility? Our Constitution was written to limit our government's role in our lives, not mandate it, except for a few things, health-care not being one of them. Corporations now subsidize their workers' health-care costs. If that is taken over by the worker(private heath-care) or the government(public health-care) the Corporations will benefit either way. 

If you listen to Glen Beck, filtering out his hysterical ramblings, you will see he spends most of his time talking about personal responsibility, liberty, and limited government. These are ideals the majority of Americans still cherish. It is these ideals being threatened by government that spurred the Tea Party movement. Everything you have been fed about the Tea Party is political slander. This is simply because the European media has the opposite political view and does not care to give a fair hearing to an opposing view.  

The Republicans in the US led by Bush began spending like traditional Democrats. Along with the cost of the wars we were going broke. This also led to the creation of the Tea Party as an opposition to both traditional parties. Then Obama came into office and tripled Bush's spending making us so broke we may not come back from it. The idea that America can, at a time when we are broke, can turn on a dime and give away free health care is laughable. If you think this is a good idea you are either insane, stupid, or want America to dissolve. If we pay back our debts and then the American people decide they want public health-care then we may do it. In the mean time, ridiculing us for not having it only shows your ignorance of America's identity and current economic situation.  ",1

"&gt;I thought it was a pretty accurate depiction of the hype surrounding Obama, with my only disappointment being that they didn't go deeper into Huey's opinion.

That was the point.  At least in 2008, when you stripped away all the media hype, Obama was an ""eh"" candidate.  He was far from the best in any area, he just managed to pull ahead through a combination of charisma and not really having anything *wrong* with him.  It's amazing how far you can get in life without being truly exceptional, especially if all your competitors keep shooting themselves in their own feet.

And, while I've been pretty impressed with his performance in the last couple months, on average he's still had an ""eh"" Presidency so far.  He's vastly better than the last few Presidents we've had, but honestly, that's largely because he's made it a year without fucking anything up *too* badly.  If things keep up like they have recently, I may have to revise my opinion upwards, but his freshman year was neither terribly great nor terribly bad.

Basically, Huey recognizes that Obama is the best candidate in the field - but that doesn't necessarily mean he's that great.  

Or, TL;DR:  **Eh.**",5

"To me it seems like it was better when I was a kid. William F. Buckley was really a terrific, intellectual Republican. But on the other hand, Three major US leaders were assassinated between the time when I was 7 and 12 years old, segregationist George Wallace ran for President in the 1968 election that saw Nixon elected and 6 years later somebody tried to kill him too.

Meanwhile Nixon was impeached for his part in illegally spying on Democrats, and then he was pardoned by the person he appointed vice president after his first vice president was forced to resign in a bribery scandal.

Then there was Carter, and the Republicans couldn't get enough of hating on him, and then we elected that motherfucker Ronald Reagan who nearly blew up the world, and probably would have if Gorbachev hadn't come into power in the Soviet Union.

Then, yeah, there was Bush, poor GHW Bush, who tricked Saddam Hussein into attacking Kuwait. And then the Republicans couldn't get enough of hating on Clinton, spent $65 million trying to impeach him, and then he got re-elected anyway.

And then George W. Bush ran the country into the ground and destroyed the US as a world power, leaving the way open for eternal Chinese hegemony.

"It's not about being whiny babies, but it IS about disorganization. Liberals, by and large, represent a fairly diverse group of people. You have liberal Christians, liberal Atheists, liberal Muslims, liberal Jews, liberal Hindus, Liberal Buddhists, so on and so forth. And that's just in regards to religion. Throw in geographical location, culture, socioeconomic status, and maybe the biggest part of all, PASSION, and you've got TONS of different interest groups lumped into one political stance.

Republicans/conservatives, on the other hand (and I hate to stereotype but I will,) are largely white Christians, most likely from the interior of the United States. There isn't much that represents them, but the things that do certainly define them: God and guns. It's easy to whip up a crowd when you tell them that one thing they all love is being oppressed, i.e. the Second Amendment or anything to do with God and government. An example of this (BUT NOT A COMPARISON) is found in Hitler: he used the fear of the German economic depression and general xenophobia to rise to power.

But because liberals/progressives have very few things in common, it's harder to get them all excited at the same time. For example, if Obama ran on environmentalism, he might get the support of Green Party followers but lose out on the timber union. The only reason he managed to get the numbers he did is because he found that hope for change is a common desire amongst most progressives. No one has found another common thread this election cycle and that's why liberal candidates aren't looking very good right now.",27

If he misses it, even once, he becomes visibly upset.  While I myself am still technically a conservative, insofar as I believe in limited federal government and limited (aka conservative) spending and I support state power and individual freedoms, I find that the differences between myself and my parents are growing and we are unable to have the civilized discussions like we used to.  Now all I hear are talking points.  I have tried for a few years now to give them links to read online, backed up by facts, even going so far as to link to the actual bills and laws we are discussing and quoting the parts in question, but it hasn't put a dent in the damage that's been done by ""conservative"" talk radio and Fox News.  My dad is now a crazy, old man, the type that is best just to ignore when he is spouting off his ignorance, and this makes me incredibly sad.

Now, as for why this has happened, I believe it has mostly to do with endorphins.  I can see in my father that watching shows like this, and hearing talk radio which does nothing more than feed his flawed opinions, is like a drug, and it's to the point where he needs a hit at least once or twice a day.  The reality of what's been going on in this country the last decade simply challenges his ideals too much, and feeding into the bullshit conservative media is his only safe haven.  This drug is more powerful than any other drug known to man.  It turns once-sane people into raving lunatics, even when they're completely sober.

I think the liberal base is deeply fractured when it comes to gay rights (among other issues as well). Your life-long union Democrat doesn't support gay marriage. He may even be outright hostile. Your illiterate welfare queen doesn't support gay marriage. But your college educated Phd does. Your hipster does. Teachers union does. SEIU does not. Illegal immigrants (typically catholic) do not. 

Meanwhile the entire right is basically unified against it. And the middle will go along with whatever sounds good this week: DADT, oh yeah that sounds good when Clinton says it. Repeal DADT, oh yeah that sounds good when Obama says it.

Then there's the dirty secret, private ballot box *in California* and gay marriage ban passes with 52%, a state that went 61% for Obama. There's a lot of people that say one thing but vote another.",-1

"&gt;The methods Bush put in place can't be altered overnight; I'm sure the Administration has been and is working to establish a system of appropriate surveillance.

You say that with no support or reason to believe it?

Even if he did what you say, it doesn't fix the problems. There's really 3 problems here

* The Wiretapping itself (which Obama the constitutional law professor called unconstitutional, and Obama the President changed on)

* The expansion in Presidential power that Bush used to create this program

* The use of ""state secrets"" to shield the Government from having to defend the program.

Even allowing for the possibility Obama  (in spite of everything he's said) 
 is working to weaken this and make it *more* Constitutional, doing so while leaving the increased powers of the President to do such things in tact would make it at best a temporary band-aid.

But once again, there's nothing that would even remotely suggest the administration has been working to make the surveillance ""appropriate""...so why would you believe that?",1

You can spend all your time trying to explaining to them that the Repubs and Dems are both pushing for the same exact things.

You can point out how Obama expanded the ""War on Terror"", how he has extended the Patriot Act, how his ""universal healthcare"" is just a money making scheme for insurance companies, etc...on and on ad infinitum.

They have no interest. You can plead with them, point out in basic terms that ""we are on the same side, I'm trying to stop you from being ripped off! Both sides are lying!"". Still they don't care.

They have been so thoroughly brainwashed that they can no longer even see the shades reality. The ""political side"" they are fighting for doesn't even exist outside their own fantasy world, yet they continue.

Whats amusing is how vitriolic the two fake sides become when debating. Each childlike mentality accuses the ""other"" of the crime their own party is guilty of. 

Wiretaps, bombing pakistan and yemen, preventative detention would've been roundly criticized months ago - now is supported. Don't bother pointing the insanity out....

"1) Whether a Federal insurance mandate is constitutional or not (I have no seen anything that would make it constitutional).  Even President Obama said it should be allowed because of the Car Insurance mandate, but that is State Governments, not Fed.  

2) I believe they are trying to say that this will pay for itself (I can't remember the gov word for that right now) like Social Security was supposed to, and medicare was supposed to.  Just don't see it happening with the current batch in Congress robbing Peter to pay Paul.

3) That corporations are evil and the reason for this mess.  Now bare with me on this one for a minute.  Federal influence in markets make them more expensive, and lets face it, the Feds have been accepting insurance bribes to write laws for a long ass time.  Why should I trust the very people who put us in this situation to make it right again? 

*EDIT* One more thing, that this is necessary.  Democrats in our government and around the country have been screaming that we need this, and use European countries as proof.  But comparing us to Europeans is apples to Oranges, by saying we need something like Germany or Norway or England is just proof to me that this should be implemented on the (much more efficient and accountable) local level.  Hell, states are WORKING on this.  People who scream on reddit that this has to be done probably haven't even called their state reps or their gov to see what is happening in their own city, state, or county.

His response to the healthcare reform being like the Civil Rights movement or Social security was a good answer, as well as critics concentrating on the 10% that was not accomplished instead of the 90% that was.

That was quite a debate! I wonder if there were any tense moments after the show cut to commercial. :)

"Hallo everyone, I'm bored and in a ranty, sarcastic mood.
And lately I have been seriously wondering... whats the deal with this bullcrap?

* Taxpayer-funded and/or legalized abortion

A lot of liberals do support this, true that.  Personally against it though.  Ethical issue with when we decide life actually begins and all that.  But hey, I at least understand that those pro-choice aren't necessarily crazy about abortion, and they certainly don't go around making fetus sammiches to hand out on college campuses, thank you very much. 

* Censorship of teacher-lead prayer in classrooms and school sponsored events

First Amendment, bitches.

* Support for gun control

I haven't heard a non-republican mention gun control in 10 years.  And figuring crack government agents didn't knock down doors taking weapons the day after Obama was sworn in like half the right thought, I'm pretty sure this is a dead issue in American politics for the time being.

* Support of obscenity and pornography as a First Amendment right

First Amendment, bitches.

* Income redistribution, usually through progressive taxation

The left supports this, but figuring that Social Security, Welfare, Unemployment, Medicare (added to in 2002, no less!), etc. still exists after 8 years of Bush and 6 years of republican control of congress I'm guessing the right does too.  (Or at least it keeps them votes.) I do agree that poor people are just swimming in cash and should fork over more to keep the government running though.  Totally sustainable, right?

* Government-rationed medical care, such as Universal Health Care

Government-rationed?  As opposed to some kind of panel the insurance companies had to deny coverage due to preexisting conditions, sometimes with deathy results?  Not that the government isn't a bloated carcass of idiocy (it is), but I'm sure that we can figure out how to reform / fix the situation so we can at least have a public-option along with the free market...

* Taxpayer-funded and government-controlled public education

Damn liberal republicans and your No Child Left Behind

* The denial of inherent gender differences

Boys have penises and girls have vaginas, lolz.  Not a good enough excuse for bigotry though.

* Insisting that men and women be placed in the same jobs in the military

As above.

* Legalized same-sex marriage

Living in Iowa, this is a more serious issue than many people give credit too.  Ever since gay marriage passed in my state the roads clog up with gay orgies, half the towns are burning up due to incredibly sexy riots, and theres this guy following me around that does this wierd winking eyebrow maneuver.  Why, oh why, did we not listen to the christian right when we had the chance?

* Tax and spend

As opposed to not-tax and still spend?

* Trying to impede the freedoms of others

Seriously?  Opposition to gay marriage, hiding our freedom from the terrorists so they magically go away, flamethrowing seperation of church and state, pot prohibition, etc.

* Implementation of affirmative action

Actually I am against this (the whole reverse racism thing), but since I figure most racism today is due to economic problems and scapegoating muslim brown people for the worlds ills we have another outlet to solve the problem, nowadays.  And I'm not alone in thinking that too.

* Political correctness

...and anyone who disagrees with me on this one is a terrorist.

* Support of labor unions

Not one union has helped out anybody or secured a workers rights in history.  Never.  For realz.
(Ass-saving: not that there are not corrupt unions out there...)

* Teaching acceptance of promiscuity through sexual ""education"" rather than teaching abstinence from sex.

Humans are sexual beings.  Deal with it.  The sooner we can accept and understand that, the sooner we can work around it and make safe choices.  Sweeping under the rug that boys and girls have different body parts (heh, above) will lead to a whole lot more pregnant high schoolers.

* A ""living Constitution"" that is reinterpreted as liberals prefer, rather than how it was intended

And you know all about how it was intended?  (Not that we shouldn't follow the constitution and follow it a bit more strictly, but still...)

* Government programs to rehabilitate criminals

Yeah, lets just stick everyone who did wrong in a big concrete box and forget about them, periodically letting them out when their sentence is up.  I'm sure they will be productive members of society after that.

* Abolition of the death penalty

And good riddance to that.  Sitting in a cell for the rest of their life contemplating their deeds will totally let them off easy, right?  Also, its hard to bring back innocent people wrongly executed while not during a zombie apocalypse.

* Environmentalism

""And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. (Genesis 2:15)""

* Disarmament treaties

""Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."" -- Issac Asimov

* Globalism

Most of the left is opposed, if I remember correctly.  Isn't that your side's issue?  And also, do you really want a bunch of unaccountable global corporations running amok doing whatever pleases them with no accountability what so ever?  Big government isn't the only thing on Earth that can take away your rights, my friend.

* Opposition to the Bible.

Outside of the reddit /r/athiest circlejerk, no.  We just don't like the sound of your hand beating on it.

* Opposition to an interventionalist American foreign policy

AMERICA, FUCK YEAH!  Acting like dicks to everyone else on a planet with only so much land and resources will help us out just dandy in the future!

* Opposition to full private property rights

As long as you don't hurt the enviroment or harm other people, most of the left is ok with this too.  Tragedy of the Commons, etc.

* Reinstating the Fairness Doctrine

Only the idiots.  First amendment, you know.  (Bitches.)

* In 2005, it was reported by CBS News that liberals were the most likely supporters of the theory of evolution. The theory of evolution is a key component of atheistic ideologies in the Western World.

Science and reason have never proved anything! ANYTHING!

* Opposition to domestic wire-tapping as authorized in the Patriot Act

How can we?  I thought that we were ""Trying to impede the freedoms of others""!

* Calling anyone they agree with a ""professor"" regardless of whether he earned that distinction based on a real peer review of his work (see, e.g., Richard Dawkins and Barack Obama).

Huh?

* Opposition of Operation Iraqi Freedom, a major part of the War on Terrorism.

Only because Iraq had no WMD's or any actual threat to us.  Oh, and it made that part of the world all that more pissed off and destabilized, creating more terrorists.  And it killed, directly or indirectly, hundreds of thousands of people.  And it wasted a bunch of money that we don't have right now.  Oh, and Bin Laden (laughing at us either/or from hell or New Jersey) wasn't camping out there.  And so on.

* Withholds support to our armed forces fighting overseas to protect their freedoms.

Again, outside of a few circlejerkers, people more or less like the troops.  We just think the right doesn't know how to use them.

* Promote arrogance through what they consider superior lifestyles.

Huh?  Yeah there are arrogant clueless liberals out there, but seeing how at least the christian right acts this isn't something confined just to one side of humanity.

* ""The long romance of Western leftists with some of the bloodiest regimes and political movements in history is a story not told often enough ....""

Oh rly?  So everything liberal or left leaning (which, as I have recently observed is totally defined as we know it today by the right, and they define it as ""anything that does not toe the strict party / conservative line, full stop, no matter what actual ideology the idea in question was"") is teh evilz and is the reason for every single life problem that has infested this little blue planet since God sneezed it out of his nose.  And you are supposed to be a teacher?  Have you ever actually peeked inside a history book to see how goddamned complicated the world is?  Hmm?  I mean come on, I'm not against conservative thought or living as a good Christian as the good book says.  I am a Christian, you know, and I believe that God is wonderful and crafty enough to give us brains to research and understand his creation, solve a few impossible problems, and just maybe work hard enough to create a world where he can smile and nod his head like a good Father rather than sigh and shake his awesome beard back and forth at the new and exciting ways we can screw things up or stagnate.  Insulating yourself from foreign ideas doesn't help you, help God, or even help your political ideology -- it hamstrings what you believe in, because it will never deepen or grow or turn into something more relevant than something a bunch of crazies shout on the side as the rest of the world moves on.  Have fun being an arrogant, ignorant dickwheat, because that is what you are and that is what you will remain if you stay as you are.

And as they say on the interweb to that kind of thinking, ""Keep **fucking** that chicken!""

He later bragged about it in speech he gave without the media present and someone recorded it on their cell phone. He met with Chinese leaders shortly after Obama became president. With the budget deficits left over from the Bush Administration he knew the US needs China to buy treasuries or else the US economy would suffer. Apparently, he was trying to tank the economy in advance of 2010 to boost his and his fellow Republicans' chances in the upcoming elections. But he's not the only one.

There's no information in the article about whether the people killed were militants, whether they were civilians, or whether they were actively trying to kill other people in the United States (or Pakistan). But the United States ""murdered"" 5 ""random"" people, according to the poster. Isn't that a wild jump to a conclusion?

And suppose the Times Square bomb did go off and did kill people. Would it somehow be better, after the fact, to kill people for it then? Clearly the car-bomb in Times Square was a genuine attempt to murder civilians. Why should it matter, in formulating a strategy to prevent a successful terrorist attack, whether this particular attack was successful or not? Should we really think ""Well, the government must keep the negative consequences it doles out to people trying to kill civilians STRICTLY less than or equal to the negative consequences inflicted to our citizens?"" That's a bizarre limitation and one that is neither practically feasible nor morally sensible.

I take it that's because people object to missile or drone attacks in general, and I honestly share your discomfort--any humane person should feel some level of discomfort with remote-control killings.

So frankly, all upvoting this article does is say ""Yeah! Damn the context! The USA is a bunch of murderers!""

I encourage redditors to read this article, and to judge for yourself, instead of mindlessly upvoting because this headline fits your preconceived notions of the USA's actions.

PS: I'm not some tea-partying, flag-waving asshole, either. I'm a liberal Obama voter. I write this only because the immediate, mindless reaction of ""YEAH!! USA IS A CORPORATE HEGEMONY MURDER-FACTORY!!"" gets tiresome and replaces what might otherwise be thoughtful discourse here.

• Overhauled the astonishing stupidity of the student loan system. Banks were being subsidized for giving loans that were guaranteed by the government anyway


• Cancelled the bloated weapons program which included the F-22 which is totally irreverent to either of our current wars

"&gt;...we could pay the deficit down just by cutting wasteful spending.

Everyone always says this (especially politicians) to avoid discussing the real problems that deficit reduction entails.  ""Waste"" is a fallacy invented by Republicans who want to sound tough on the federal spending without cutting any popular programs.  McCain used this rhetoric in his campaign, including the ever-popular appeal to eliminating ear-marks.  

I'm not sure how accurate it is, but [this graph](http://www.cbpp.org/images/cms//PolicyBasic_WhereOurTaxDollarsGo-f1_rev4-14-10.jpg) from the CBO shows the general point.  Social Security and health care programs account for 41% of federal spending.  Tax credits for the poor and unemployed and such account for 14% of spending.  Defense, a favorite target for cuts among redditors, is 20% and certainly entails some waste.  There are probably some savings to be found in eliminating Medicare/Medicaid fraud.  Nonetheless, without radically restructuring these programs (which no politician supports as cutting benefits is unpopular) or vastly reducing the stretch of the military (which will never happen, as popular as isolationism is among redditors), these major components of federal spending cannot be reduced enough to make any difference in the deficit.

I agree that Obama should cut spending (although probably not until 2012 or so given the state of the economic recovery.  However, these cuts will look more like those in Britain (where every department outside the NHS, defense (I think), and education are facing massive cuts) than like this mythical political nonsense of ""cutting wasteful spending.""  

tl;dr Cutting wasteful spending is political nonsense; real, popular programs (or defense) have to be significantly cut, as in Britain, to make any difference in the deficit

"I'm not really sure it's being used more often or not, I don't have numbers either way. But it is being used to stymie Health Care. This seems to be the biggest gripe about the filibuster right now. And to do away with it because of that is short sighted IMO.

&gt;There is a reason that the rules only require 51 votes to pass most things normally.

And most things are still being passed with a simple majority. You just don't hear about those. It's just a few things that the Republicans are stubbornly blocking with the threat of filibuster. And frankly, the Democrats have pretty much themselves to blame for it. Because the Democratic leadership, (including Obama), can't seem to lead their own caucus effectively. If they can break just one filibuster, they would break them all.

If there is any change I'd like to see, I'd make them go back to having to get up off their fat butts and actually do the filibuster. Make speeches or read from the phone book, I don't care. If you believe that fervently that you are right, prove it with deeds, not idle threats.",1
"I am not sure if this will help, and it is certainly my personal opinion. If the republicans' main concern was helping out small business they wouldn't put congress at a standstill. Instead they would compromise and say how about if we extend the tax cuts to individual citizens who make less than 250,000 a year, and add businesses which employ less than x number of employees, or businesses who have year end profit margins below x number of dollars. I believe that republicans have other reasons for delaying congress. I think the less that gets done under the Obama administration the better the Republican Party will look come election time.

So did Obama.

The health insurance industry *loves* the Obamacare (if you disagree, see [this interview with a former health insurance executive of one of the country's largest health insurance companies](http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/16/wendell_potter_on_deadly_spin_an).)

&gt; oppose nuclear arms treaty ... check,

Obama talks a good game, but he signed off on the Pentagon's plan to open up new nuclear bomb production facilities and to rebuild and ""enhance"" our nuclear weapons. That doesn't sound like a ""Peace Prize"" winner to me.

&gt; oppose net neutrality ... check,

Obama and the Democrats are showing many signs of flip-flopping on this issue. Just wait...

&gt; support wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ... check,

Obama refuses to pull US troops out of Iraq -- Obama actually extended Bush's Iraq troop withdrawal deadline. And are you so fucking clueless that you're claiming Obama does *not* support the war in Afghanistan?!

&gt; oppose science education ... check,

I haven't seen anything that Obama opposes science education. Got to give Obama credit for that. (But the Obama administration continues to edit/censor scientists on the issue of global warming, albeit not as heavy-handedly as Bush did.)

&gt; support religious indoctrination ... check.

I've yet to see *anyone* offer an alternative path to extending unemployment benefits that would have cleared the same 60 vote hurdle. When it comes to a casual relationship with reality it seems to me lots of these folks still think 2008 was about America deciding to move hard left. That doesn't seem to be the case given the results of the election held only about a month ago.

"I actually agree with you on a lot of that, and am torn on which party I would ever want to support.  The problem to me, is Democrats are always saying that they're going to take away from the rich and give to the poor.

Okay, but those of us who are intelligent enough to want to see all of the facts before agreeing with anything still have a huge question in the back of our minds.  What constitutes ""rich""?  Obama came out and said it during his campaign, that if you make over $250,000 a year, then you are rich, and should be taxed more to help out the poor.  And, if you make under that amount, then your taxes will not go up.  Fair enough, I can support that ideal.

Fast forward a year and a half later, and this ""socialized medicine"" has completely turned into a different animal altogether.  Socialization is no longer on the table, but it is now a mandate instead.  Yes, if you make under $17,000 a year, then it will be free for you.  But, if you make under $17,000 a year, then you probably have bigger problems than health care...like nowhere to live or nothing to eat.  It's called the poverty level for a reason, and I honestly believe that it should be higher, around $30,000.  Then, if you make more than the poverty level, then the government will give you a little bit of a tax deduction to help you out...oh, unless you make over $44,000 a year.

So, people like me (you know, the middle class?) are completely screwed.  I am just over that line, but suddenly I'm okay and left to fend for myself.  Seriously, should I ask my boss for a $1000 pay decrease just so I can get discounted insurance?  What if you take the standard deduction?  Last year, it was $5700.  Will that bring my income down below the $44,000 so that I *AM* eligible for assistance?

If the Democrats want to take from the billionaires who are responsible for 99% of the world's problems and give it to the poor, like some sort of political Robin Hood, that's fine with me.  But why must the middle class become a casualty in this whole battle?  They're forgetting who the ""most important"" piece of our economy is.  Sure, we have the 10% who are unemployed, but what about the other 90%?  You know, the ones who know they are next when that number climbs to 15%, 20%, 25%...

You work your ass off every day for a company, trying to make ends meet.  You need more employees, but in this economy every company is afraid to hire and stretch themselves too thin.  So, the 90% who are still employed are overworked, overstressed, underpaid, and now if our employer doesn't give us insurance, we will be forced to individually buy health insurance, whether we can afford it or not?  Not to mention that this bill is actually making health insurance prices go up.  (before the bill, I looked and for a healthy male in his early 30's to get basic insurance with a $1000 deductible would be around $100 a month...now it has doubled to $200!  WTF!?)

I understand the whole thing with getting rid of pre-existing conditions, and that's one part of the bill that I can stand behind without question...but must the Democrats rape the middle class while they're at it?  I'm not trying to be a dick, but this has seriously put me into a bad financial situation, and the only thing that I can hope for is (A) a complete repeal of the bill, which would be bad for those with pre-existing conditions...  (B) some kind of major change in my life between now and 2014 that makes this somehow affordable for me...  (C) if the standard deduction makes me eligible for the subsidy, and it actually takes a large chunk out of my out-of-pocket expenses...  (D) pay the penalty for not having insurance... what is it, like a $500 fine per year?

To me, Democrats just seem notorious for looking high and low when they're trying to solve a crisis, but completely ignoring the middle class that makes up 2/3 of their voter base.

I can probably safely say that most of Reddit consists of Generation X and Generation Y.  Am I not the only one who sees what is going on here?  My parents, OUR parents, aka the baby boomers, have had amazing lives.  Many of them got married straight out of high school.  They got good paying jobs, had kids, bought houses.  My dad was/is definitely NOT wealthy by any definition of the word, yet he had his life set by the time he was 30.  He had a house, 2 cars, 2 kids, a wife who stayed home to take care of the kids, a decent job that he's been with for about 30 years now.  I'm 32 now, I make WAY more money than my dad did at this age, but there's no way I can afford a house.  (they cost about 4x-5x more than they did when he bought his first house!!!)  I love my parents to death, but I have to admit, their generation has driven our country's economy into the ground.

The point is, while Bush and his goons may have created these unconstitutional programs, the people you and I elected, the congressmen, put the programs into motion.

There are far more powerful people at the hands of these newly created organizations than just President Obama. For fuck sake, this year alone the newly created Office of Homeland Security will be allocated something like $42 Billion. That is a lot of money, going towards a lot of bureaucracy. Even if Obama said tomorrow that he is exercising his presidential power to dis-enact the PATRIOT act, and end wire taping, the bureaucrats, congressmen, lawmakers, and military officials would go APE SHIT!!. You're talking about taking away a $42 billion budget from the hands of these people. They will fight for it, for whatever it takes.

To give you an idea of how much money that is, **The United States Government total 2010 Fiscal Budget allocated towards EDUCATION is [$46.7 Billion](http://www2.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2009/05/05072009a.html); a difference of 10% when compared to Homeland Security.** It's FUCKING INSANITY!! 

So I know it may seem like no one is backing you up, it's not the case. The point here is that it's in the best interest of the people, you and I, to get what we want. And what you and I want is food on our table and jobs to work with, and financial reform, and health care reform, and the return of overtime and benefits. That's what I want, which is what I can only hope for in Obama. Nothing more, nothing less.

But, like in East Germany, there's a strong bias against saying so out loud. Perhaps not *quite* as strong as in East Germany, where one could suffer greatly for saying out loud that communism should end. Here, they just look at you like a kook.

So, what we have here is Obama being exactly the opposite of what he claimed to be... hope, change, yadda yadda yadda. He could have single-handedly ushered in a revolution. He chose not to. That makes him, among other things, an asshole and a liar, not to mention a wasteful fool of our own national wealth.",2

Basically, the policy now is that government can't negotiate for bulk discounts, or discounts of any sort.  That would be interference.  It has been suggested that the government, as the largest purchaser of most drugs, should be able to negotiate for lower cost.  But, Obama promised not to support negotiations.  This means that the government pays what the drug companies say is fair market value.

I'm referring to the political spectrum. To the Right, you find much more fear mongering and rumors that are fed to them as facts. Opinions are one thing, but when facts are substituted with people's opinions, something goes horribly wrong. A good example would be the lynching of ACORN, Obama's birth and religion, Shirley Sharrod, etc. There are no equivalents seen in the Leftist media outlets. 

Take the far Left conspiracy theory that Palin's Down syndrome kid is actually Bristol's. MSNBC and CNN wouldn't air such a crazy story because the Left would tear it apart. However, if such a story were the same, but about Obama, FOX News would run it into the ground. Their viewers would eat it up.

I would think the economy should be stabilized long before we think about simplifying the setup. I'm guessing you are a Ron Paul supporter. Am I right? I actually liked the guy, but feel his best place as President would have been in 2000 before everything went to shit, and we had a surplus.

"&gt;LaHood to GOP governors: No trains, no money
&gt;
&gt;By JOAN LOWY , Associated Press 
&gt;
&gt;WASHINGTON - The Obama administration has a message for Republican governors who campaigned against the president's high-speed rail program: Build the trains or give back the money.
&gt;
&gt;Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood on Tuesday rejected a request from Gov.-elect John Kasich in Ohio to use the $400 million in federal funds pledged to that state's train project on other projects like road construction or freight lines.
&gt;
&gt;""I would like high-speed rail to be part of Ohio's future,"" LaHood wrote. But if the state won't go forward, it's necessary ""to wind down Ohio's involvement in the project so that we do not waste taxpayers' money,"" he said.
&gt;
&gt;A day earlier LaHood sent the same message to Wisconsin officials about the $810 million in rail money pledged to that state. Wisconsin Gov.-elect Scott Walker campaigned against the Madison-to-Milwaukee line, including creating a website opposed to the project.
&gt;
&gt;The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which allocated an initial $8 billion for a high-speed rail program, doesn't allow the money to be spend for other purposes, said Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers.
&gt;
&gt;The Republican governor-elects have criticized the high-speed rail program as unaffordable in tough economic times. Both states would have to invest considerable dollars in the projects in addition to federal aid. Walker on Tuesday urged the federal government to give up on high-speed rail and instead use the money to repair roads and bridges he said were ""literally crumbling.""
&gt;
&gt;Kasich has said that the top speed of 79 miles per hour on the proposed Ohio project is too slow and he has questioned whether enough people will ride it. About 6 million people live along the Cleveland to Cincinnati corridor, making it one of the most heavily populated corridors without rail service in the Midwest — but a well-used interstate, I-71, lies along the same route.
&gt;
&gt;The administration contends the projects will generate jobs and provide needed alternatives to congested highways and airports. Thirty foreign rail manufacturers have committed to locate operations in the United States ""so that we can restart idled manufacturing plants in Ohio and other states,"" LaHood wrote Kasich.
&gt;
&gt;LaHood also lavished praise in a blog posting Tuesday on New Yorkers who have started a Facebook campaign to back a high-speed rail project in the Empire State.
&gt;
&gt;""They know that saying 'no' to high speed rail is saying 'no' to jobs, 'no' to revitalized manufacturing, and 'no' to economic development,"" LaHood said.
&gt;
&gt;The blog posting ""is part of the message that they're trying to drive home to states that are on verge of turning down the money that the money really can go to other places,"" Capon said.
&gt;
&gt;Kasich indicated he isn't giving up the money without a fight.
&gt;
&gt;The governor-elect ""is fully aware of the rules surrounding the use of federal funds and remains interested in pursuing additional flexibilities on this issue,"" said Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols. ""It is, however, refreshing to see that Secretary LaHood understands the importance of preventing anymore wasteful spending on the passenger rail project.""

Obama just decided to mention it this weekend.  It just shows how people don't really know what's in the bill.  (Plus it's phasing in over 10 years so it's not like it's going to be closed tomorrow.) Also, Democrats can't sell. This was Obama's attempt to bring up what (should) now be a golden oldie.",4

Those people are ok with Obama carrying on the Bush Doctrine and [expanding global covert war against the Muslims](http://news.antiwar.com/2010/06/04/obama-has-special-forces-operating-in-75-nations/)....  or maybe you didn't read the article?,1
"&gt;I won't put Obama on a left-right axis; I believe that he's mostly somewhere else.

If he is not on the left-right axis of the  political spectrum, then where is he?  

&gt;Then there's ObamaCare. When the dust settles, it will be a national health care system run from DC.

Right.  Because the inflated health insurance from private corporations which screw patients because of pre-existing illnesses is much better.  

&gt;Then there's the Internet: So, the FTC is thinking about sales taxes on the Internet. Obama is thinking about having the NSA handle Internet security. The FCC wants to regulate the Internet under the old laws for regulating the old phone companies. 

This crap was going on during GWB's terms as well.   During those 8 years, the government as a whole considered allowing the NSA to handle internet security.  I have been fighting the Net Neutrality issue for 4+ years.  Clearly, you only pay attention to the news for confirmation bias.  


&gt;Obama wants a big button on his desk to let him shutdown the Internet. 

Another lie.  Here's a suggestion:  Actually read about this bill.  A Republican and Democrat senator along with Lieberman wrote and sponsored this bill.  Quit blaming President Obama for stuff that is NOT his fault.

&gt;Obama wants to tax Internet news aggregators such a Google News and Drudge Report. 

Without citation, this is another lie. 


&gt; White House funding of the NYT, Wapo, and LAT?

When did this happen?  When did the White House give funding to these papers?  Why is the LA Times laying off reporters if they received this alleged funding?

&gt;So, power over our electric utilities.

Another oppositional and untrue comment.  Deregulating electric utilities in California caused a financial crisis in that state.  In Texas, deregulation of the utilties has caused electric prices to be some of the highest in the nation.  

&gt;Looks to me like Obama is grabbing for power he can use for whate else he wants.

This is a paranoid statement considering it is based on untrue nonsense.

&gt;But the way I read the news, 

No.  You clearly do NOT pay attention to the news as well as you think you do. This has already been established.

&gt; Then there was mutiny on the decks when 87 or some such Senators signed a letter to Obama saying that he should support Israel -- I took this letter as mostly just a show of force in Congress telling Obama that his days of ObamaCare tactics were OVER.

????

&gt;After Novermber we will likely have grid lock in Congress for two years.

Again, more proof you only pay attention to the news for confirmation bias.  After all, Congressional record proves the Republicans have grid locked the process with an unprecedented lack of cooperation since Obama was inaugerated.",2

Then it's a good thing I didn't mention Congressmen, I mentioned ""political leaders.""  Rush Limbaugh is a leader of the GOP, whether or not he has an official position.  Keith Olbermann is likewise a leader of the DNC, the difference is that Limbaugh has been known to use inflammatory language to [incite violence](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-feldman/did-limbaugh-incite-viole_b_100586.html).  Olbermann has not.

&gt; and it's been done before. by democrats. by hippies. by stalinists. by antistalinists. by antinazis. by racial rioters - both prosegregationists and antisegregationists.

Funny, I seem to remember hippies being derided as peaceniks because of their opposition to violence.  Yes, there's the Weathermen Underground Organization that was repeatedly denounced by Democrats, no winking included.  When Sarah Palin posts a map with targets on Democratic politicians, she's not *officially* advocating violence but she's winking pretty hard.

&gt; we're making a lot of hot air about someone else's ability to make a lot of hot air.

When that Nazi idiot marched into the museum in Washington and started shooting people, it was an isolated incident.  When Teabaggers openly carried firearms to an event where the President was appearing and got sympathy from political leaders, it was curious.  When Joseph Stack ran his plane into the IRS building and got sympathy from GOP politicians, we started to understand.  With Republicans building up massive rhetoric against the Democrats, and Democrats started getting death threats and acts of vandalism against them and their families, we see a pattern.

There is no equivalence here.  The protests against the Bush administration as late as 2008 were almost uniformly peaceful, where the protests against Obama have been getting progressively rowdier.  The comparisons of civil disobedience between Democrats and Republicans are extremely weak.",0

There has been a backlash against some of Obama's policies and decisions.  In truth, many of those policies and decisions were the very things that kept some people from voting for Obama in the first place.  It isn't racism to oppose spending hundreds of billions of dollars that we don't have on bank bailouts, or on socialized medicine.

Why? If he wants the people who use the roads to pay for the roads, then he will pay for the roads as they are embedded in the prices of things that are shipped.

The main point of the argument was that Obama is centrally planning what is best for everyone else and giving the money to large corporations so that they'll build what he deems best.

May 11, 2010
NEW YORK – Two private investigators working independently are asking why President Obama is using a Social Security number set aside for applicants in Connecticut while there is no record he ever had a mailing address in the state.

In addition, the records indicate the number was issued between 1977 and 1979, yet Obama's earliest employment reportedly was in 1975 at a Baskin-Robbins ice-cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii.

WND has copies of affidavits filed separately in a presidential eligibility lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia by Ohio licensed private investigator Susan Daniels and Colorado private investigator John N. Sampson.

The investigators believe Obama needs to explain why he is using a Social Security number reserved for Connecticut applicants that was issued at a date later than he is known to have held employment. ""

""The question is being raised amid speculation about the president's history fueled by an extraordinary lack of public documentation. Along with his original birth certificate, Obama also has not released educational records, scholarly articles, passport documents, medical records, papers from his service in the Illinois state Senate, Illinois State Bar Association records, any baptism records and adoption papers.""

&gt; 2) arrange for reparations to the suffering Iraqi people

That's not how these things work

&gt; 3) vigorously prosecute those responsible for this horrendous war crime

This is always the source of the problem, when it comes to arguments over voting. I don't want a system in which my only two choices are O'Donnell or Coons, Gore or Bush, McCain or Obama or... well, you get the point. Seriously, no thank you.

&gt;Also, you have to think of it this way: if you don't vote, you have no right to complain about the job that either of them do because you refused to participate by supporting any candidate at all. Sure you have the ""right"" to speak freely, but why should Coons care about you when you wouldn't have voted for him anyway?

I don't have a right to complain about violations against me committed by those that I do not wish to have authority over me? But at the end of that paragraph, the issue becomes clearer: our disagreement is in our commitment to democracy. You're committed to it; I'm not.

&gt;You can't just give up responsibility by not acting. Life does not work that way. You have some level of control over the outcome, so you are obligated to choose the best option.

What responsibility am I giving up? I say that I am not giving up any responsibility. Remember in a democracy, when you vote, what you're doing is binding everyone affected (everyone in your borough, state, country, whatever) to your political will -- and in doing so, you're attempting to create a sense of responsibility in them toward meeting your desired ends. My lack of desire to participate in this system isn't ""giving up responsibility"" or being lazy. What I'm doing is minimizing your attempt at obligating me to your will as much as possible.

Am I free of your political will? Of course not; this is no anarchy, and I'm not going off the grid. But in minimizing the obligation, there is a chance of reducing legitimacy in a broken system to the extent that genuine reform may take hold.",0

If Obama cannot close down even a prison camp, what can he do? Are you telling me it is impossible to hold these prisoners in a high security prison within the continental US? 

All this emotional BS that he is dishing out to you - that you are so willing to lap up, indicates that the man knows what he is doing.. He knows that there are enough suckers in the US who will buy his pathetic excuses and not just buy them, also fight for him when someone else holds him accountable for his screwups.

Obama is a politician - he didn't become president because suddenly all the Democrat politicians had a twinge of conscience and decided that this time around, they are going to be letting a ""good"" guy become the President. They are just going to lay down all their plans, their greed for power and let a nice man who only knows to do good become the President. 

Obama became the Democrat's choice for President because they (the politicians) saw him as someone who would advance their goals - who would get them and their supporters (read as lobbyists) what they want - not because they all suddenly become magnanimous and decided that the good of the Americans should come first.",1

"&gt;Why should he? Did Obama say he wouldn't play golf anymore?

He shouldn't be - I think you're missing my point a little bit. I'm not saying Obama shouldn't play golf - in fact, if that's what he enjoys I hope he continues to do so. I want my President to be in tip top shape mentally, and R&amp;R is a huge part of that. 

All I was saying is that I'd like a little more consistency in politics - people weren't hammering Bush because he was playing golf, they were hammering him because they hated Bush and looked for any excuse to go after him. I say this because you don't see late night comedians and political commentators bitching about Obama's golf playing the way they bitched about Bush. 

If you want to say that a President shouldn't be out playing golf during wartime then go ahead, but be consistent and bash Obama too - I'm not going to criticize Obama for golfing because I didn't criticize Bush for golfing, but too many people get too caught up in the heat of politics to act maturely about things like this.",1

a. I'm not one of those Obama's going to take all your guns people. I'm more one of those ""the government"" is going to take all your guns people since both parties have been ratcheting controls into place for the last 75 years or more.

b. Registration of ammo purchases is a sneaky end run on registration of guns. People don't buy ammo for guns they don't have. And based on the bullet caliber, you can make a pretty good guess what weapons they do own.

c. More importantly, it creates another barrier to shooting which will result in fewer people shooting for fun or with their families. The impact of this is that fewer kids will grow up familiar with guns, we'll increase the population's fear of guns, and decrease the population's resistance to further controls on those ""evil weapons.""

Say what you want about Bush, but as soon as he was elected he pursued a right-wing agenda that appeased his base and hammered it through Congress with his ""mandate"".  

This is typical behavior from conservative Democrats.  They slap the base around for 2 years and throw their hands up when an election comes around and go ""why aren't you guys excited to re-elect us?""

Granted it's a unique situation that President Obama has with the Dems having the voting majority in both houses.

Do you agree Obama is heavily supported by the financial industry?

Do you think he has a conflict of interest between the financial backers who contributed to his election and the American people who pay for support of the banks?

Though, from your answers perhaps this is a better question...

Do you think that Obama is supporting the financial industry?

It's clear to me the American political system elects people based on who their corporate backers are, resulting in massive conflicts of interest.

What I am not for is people placing misguided blame on the wrong person or party.

"&gt;This is a stupid post and I will tell you why.

Ok let us go further in depth on what you said and the relevance of the said wars.

&gt;The Democrats started the Korean War..

Fuck yes they did, and rightly too! the North had invaded the South, the US protected the new nation as did alot of countries, the Korean war was fought in the DEFENCE of South Korea and wasn't an invasion say like in Iraq or Afghanistan but that is neither here nor there, we'll get back to that soon! 


&gt; and basically started American involvement in Vietnam, the two of which combined add up to 19 years, longer than Afghanistan/Iraq. They were paid for, I suppose, but I don't see that as a terribly important consideration when discussing wars.

Well that really depends on how you discuss the start of US involvement because if You go from the start of the First Indochina War where the US supported the French in their fight against the Viet Minh, that would have been under Eisenhower...  Viet Nam was a mess supported by both governments, Nixon's  promise to end that was based around the concept of bombing it to shit with napalm, dropping more bombs on viet nam than were dropped in all of WWII (interesting fact that) 

Long story short Vietnam was a mistake made by both parties 50 years ago, if you want to judge these parties now on their actions then then why not go all the way back. 

I still think you're comparing apples and oranges though...

&gt; See how the line only goes negative for during the end of Clinton's term? Every other president put us in massive debt, from Kennedy through Obama.

Retarded point, just because clinton was the only person to inherit debt and then bring the budget into surplus for the first time doesn't mean that what about presidents who inherited debt and brought it down during their terms? or congresses?

&gt; Republicans support keeping taxes low for everyone

yes republicans wish they could keep their taxes low and fund all their wars and necessities. sadly they couldnt cut taxes for everyone so they just do it for the wealthy. 

&gt; In other words, only Republicans disagree with you about the proper scope of government (which isn't really true; libertarians and anarchists and other small groups also disagree with you)

Again you go comparing apples (a political party) with oranges (political ideologies) Alot of republicans are libertarians.

&gt; Both parties whine about stupid stuff when they're out of power. When Democrats were in the minority, they whined about Republicans using ""unprecedented procedural tricks"" that Democrats had used a few years earlier (e.g. Queen/King-of-the-Hill voting in the House). Everyone complains when they don't get their way.

not going to argue over the oppositions role being to criticize the government but what ever.

"&gt;We'll see how President Obama plays this situation - it could end up working out OK.

It could.

Think about one thing that the GOP gets positively apoplectic about in healthcare -- tort reform.  The GOP doesn't need to ""overturn Obamacare"" if they can claim they are going to ""fix it"" instead.  And if by ""fixing it"" they are actually making it better because they end up having to incorporate something like [what Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama published in the New England Journal of Medicine all the way back in 2006](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp068100) then it's a net positive for the bill, and the GOP gets to pretend like they fixed the bill.  It's all about perceptions, for them.

I expect some interesting dynamics to come out of the 112th Congress ... especially considering that Obama mentioned the Filibuster *twice* on his interview on the Daily Show, and the need to change the rules.  The Senate and Harry Reid are gearing up for a fight.  Rep. Boehner is boxed in on two ends ... he's going to have to play along (I hope).",1
"I am getting an income source by serving my country and performing a task at a military unit.  I won't deny that the military is hardly a stellar performer as far as fiscal responsibility is concerned, but I am not receiving income for nothing.  I am receiving income in exchange for *doing something*.

Unemployment benefits aren't bad.  People fall on hard times, and as a civilized society, we should help them out during those times so that they can get back on their feet and resume being a productive member of society.  

But there must come a point where they must stop, because otherwise there is no motivator to work for capital when you can simply elect Democrats for capital (at least until China starts making collections calls to President Obama).

We need to get this country to a point where people can expect to work a reasonable work week with reasonable time off and holidays, and be able to afford all of the necessities expected from living in a first-world society, and *some* of the luxuries expected from living in a first-world society.  Society gets a product and/or a service out of that work.  Society does not get a product and/or a service out of unemployment benefits.",-2
Obama received much more from small contribtors than McCain.,5
"So. Much. Bullshit.

A few examples:

&gt;(1/21/09)   Enacted pay freeze on white house members making more than 100k

Didn't lay off any (significant quantity), even though the private sector is hemorrhaging jobs.

&gt;(1/22/09)   Ordered the end of detention without due process at Guantanamo

The detention without due process still goes on, just not in Guantanamo anymore - too much bad press.

&gt;(6/1/09)    Cash 4 Clunkers boosts MPG of automotive fleet to all-time high

Curious to see how much we went up in mpg. Many analyses show that C4C just consolidated purchasing over a long period into the one month it was going on, not actually increasing sales overall. Also, consumer debt for autos is unsurprisingly higher now, too. And those clunkers that the poor need (because they can't afford a new car, even with C4C) were destroyed. Intense loss of wealth there. It's the broken windshield fallacy.

&gt;(10/1/09)   Prohibited federal workers from texting while driving

Reckless or unsafe driving is already a crime in *every* state. It doesn't matter what causes it (eating, reading, putting on makeup, texting, etc.).

A lot of these points are boasting how much more Obama is spending than Bush or any other president did. Obama is a fan of the Patriot Act. He has continued warrantless wiretapping, continued both ""wars"" (escalating Afgh.), started mass drone bombing Pakistan, the list goes on...",8
"I don't know what you are talking about right now.

You're overreacting to the endorsement by Obama. Appreciate the recognition and celebrate the legitimacy, not shoot it down.

Ad hominem attacks don't help, either.",2
"The only thing I don't understand is why you point out how biased an untruthful one side of the coin is.  Both sides are liars.

Let's start with Glenn Beck.  I hate the guy.  I think he's dangerous.  Then, the other day I asked myself why.  Why do I think these things?  Do I know my opinions to be accurate?  Were they even based on anything objective?  I then realized that, as I suspect is true for most people, my opinions were largely shaped by other people's opinions -- whether it was news media that rails against him, regardless of what he says, or if it was reading comments in forums like reddit where I often go to have my opinions supported.

That, my friend, is not thinking.  It's mindless.  So, I challenged myself to check out what he says that are supposedly fact-based and determine from the most objective evidence I could find that he was a liar.  And, to my disgust I found that he doesn't always lie.  Some of the fact-based stuff he says while acting like a demagogue are true.  So, while I disagree with his tone and his methods, I cannot label him any more of a liar than anyone else on planet earth.

Then, I started thinking about the reaction I had to Sarah Palin.  Again, I hated her.  Still do, I guess.  But why?  She ""appeared"" to be an idiot.  But, again, upon what was this opinion based?  And, again, I found it was media portrayals.  So, I studied her.  And, I was surprised to discover how much the republican base hated her when she was selected as the VP candidate with McCain.  It wasn't just the democrats -- damn near everyone hated her.  Except for Alaskans -- her approval ratings in Alaska (for being governor) were damn high.  So, I wondered, why did everyone hate her so much?  Was it the lack of experience?  Well, that might be the reason, but then, why did Obama -- the candidate for whom I voted -- get a pass on that issue?  He had NEVER been in an executive government position.  Why was she singled out for the lack of experience ridicule and Obama allowed to skate on that issue?  I still don't have any idea.  I have surmised that the reason was that we just didn't feel like she was of presidential timber.

But, is theer any other reason for her vilification?  Then, I started thinking about who gets to be president and who gets to be congress m men and women.  And, one thing that stuck out was that Palin was not in the ""in"" crowd.  She was not part of the ruling elite.  She didn't attend an Ivy league school -- she is more of a blue collar joe -- a Philistine.  And, she had the temerity to stick her head in the rich boys' club.  So, they wanted to make her pay.

Of course, there is no proof for this theory -- but then, outside of an admission, what proof would there be -- other than the fact that the government is dominated by the ruling elite -- regardless of party affiliation.

I have been a liberal idealist for most of my 38 years.  But, I have come to realize that both sides are interested in one thing -- their power base.  I see comments on here all the time about how we would rather have the government running things than corporations.  The problem is that THEY ARE THE SAME DAMN THING.  We have a ruling class in this country.  They run our corporations and they run our government.  It's six one way and half a dozen the other.

This fact was hammered home to me in a statement Hillary Clinton made to the press about the TSA searches of airline passengers.  When asked what she thought about the TSA's new practice `, Hillary said she wouldn't want to go through it.  And that's it in a nutshell.  She never will have to go through it.  There are two sets of rules -- and the people making the rules that have led the TSA to grope passengers and otherwise invade their privacy in ways that we would never have allowed 10 years ago are NOT SUBJECT to the privacy invasion.
What bothers me more about the TSA practices is that these new invasions of privacy were introduced while we have a Democrat as the chief executive.  WTF?

I don't know what to think about the direction things are headed, but one thing I do know is that people on both sides of the debate are trolls -- barely anyone has facts to back up their hatred.  They just feel the way they do.  I'm not lumping everyone into this category, but your dad may not be the naive fool you portray him to be -- and you may not have developed your own thoughts on the matter, but instead are judging your dad in comparison with someone else's opinions that you have neither confirmed nor discredited on your won using your own thoughts and objective research.

1. Steele’s suspicion of the war effort completely contradicts his party’s position, but it also conflicts with his own prior statements..

2. After President Obama was “hammered by opponents on the right” last year for supposedly taking too long to announce his plan for the campaign, Steele called the war a “crucial fight.” 

3. Steele attacked Obama for “sending mixed signals by outlining the exit before these troops even get on the ground undermines their ability to succeed.”

&gt; Steele: ""...has he not understood that you know that's the one thing you don't do, is engage in land war in Afghanistan?""

   For example, A simple Air Force One flyover photo-op, of the statue of liberty, ( which scared the fuck out of New York, had no President on board, no staffers, maybe the skeleton Air Force personell and just one F16 jet for about an hour cost $330,000.00.  

Using this as just a basic metric for Air Force One. You can easily assume a calculation of $40,000,000.00 or more for the cost of just Air Force One on this Pan-Asian trip. 

This is not including all of the other planes, forward preparation trips, the food lodging, vehicle shipment, logistics, and other travel expenditures. This also does not take into account all of the security measures of the host countries. 

   I laugh at the comparison for the Afghan war numbers and how the trip absolutely has to be miniscule in comparison.  You have Tents and rickety FOB's, vs. Posh hotel rooms, suites and villas. You have MRE's and ARMY food vs. $200.00 a plate dinners or even more.  You have highly paid SS teams, staffers and officials, vs. Army and Air Force personell which make about half the pay of the staffers and the SS agents. 
 
   The big question is, what the fuck is all this for? What do we get out of this? Is he invading India? Can he leave some of the staffers and leeches over there? How is it that the greenest president evah, creates the largest carbon foot print of any president evah?  No matter which way you slice it and whether the actual number is a lot lower... it's just one hell of a bad PR move.

"Idiot.

Not everything is the economy, which, by the way, is doing just fine - if you're a millionaire, which is all repugnants care about.

START 1 has expired. It was an arms control treaty proposed by Reagan and implemented by Bush. It is critical to the safety and security of this country and is a key part of a security plan to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists.

A 'Joint understanding for a follow-on agreement to START-1' was signed by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitri Medvedev in Moscow on 6 July 2009. This will further reduce the number of deployed warheads on each side to 1,500–1,675 on 500–1,100 delivery systems. A new treaty was to be signed before START-1 expired in December 2009 and the reductions are to be achieved within seven years. After many months of negotiations, Presidents Obama and Medvedev signed the successor treaty, Measures to Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, in Prague, Czech Republic on 8 April 2010. The senate must confirm this treaty before it can go into effect. They have yet to do so.

So all that trust but verify stuff Ronald Reagan was so into? Well, now we can't verify. And for as much as you're worried about some Muslim guy blowing up a plane and killing a few hundred people, these are weapons designed to kill hundreds of millions of people. Do you feel more secure knowing we're just taking everything on faith from the Russians? Or that our intelligence on their missile designs and practices is growing older by the day?

So you see, it isn't an evil plot by the president or democrats.

"I don't know if this is a real opportunity to get slammed or not but I'll say:

People see corporations kicking their asses and, despite a call for change you can believe in, they kept seeing corporations kicking their asses.  It seemed the same and it scared them.  While there was change, lots of it, none of it discussed by the media, the ongoing news what was happening to them and their neighbors...losing jobs...losing homes and, largely, the only things being done were:

* Handouts to banks (In addition to money, laws that are further supporting banks and Federal attempts to usurp state laws for banks.  I mean, Congress's voice vote on the new rules for accepting notary seals was downright surreal.)
* Programs to help homeowners.  (I don't think Americans want programs and they don't like having to use them.  It's degrading.  Most banks were using them to foreclose anyway.)
* Very little being done about the root of the problem which was a mess created by banks and fraud being perpetrated by banks.
* More and more fraud being uncovered and the government just brushing it off and no indictments, no punishments, not even fines.

I think they wanted their fears calmed and some justice.  I'm no Teapartier but I think this was visceral...fear and anger are visceral.  I keep wondering if they were sensing that the silence from Washington was Washington's admission that the two parties had the one thing in common that they couldn't stomach any more...bank influence.  When they voted Obama in, I think they wanted someone to go in and clean house but what they got, instead, was a fairly pure progressive agenda which, in Obama's mind, was the right change and, perhaps, long overdue...but it didn't address the major crisis that had engulfed the nation...fairly much ignored it.  In the crisis, the thing that was consuming the vast majority of Americans, they got ""let the system work"" and ""status quo"".  I doubt that's what they wanted.  People kept losing their jobs and their homes and it was getting closer and closer to home.  If I'm right, any new party that appeared would have been good enough so long as it was a different group of people in Congress.  They're still hoping for the crisis to be addressed and they're hoping that this so-called ""Tea Party"" will do it.

"These are just organizing for America talking points. The first big bill he had before the congress was stimulus. The republican's were set to bow to his incredible power, given to him via electoral mandate. Then he just shut them out in a disrespectful way.  There was no greater evidence of his willingness to work with republicans than his actions at that time. The fact that he incorporates ideas is one thing. The fact that he is willing to work with them is another. He went after Paul Ryan quite hard just for questioning Obama's actions during the stimulus debate. This topic came up during his meeting with republicans.  BTW Paul Ryan was right, stimulus didn't turn the economy around as the Dems predicted.  Maybe is provided some hope, but turn the economy around, no.

Again cherry picking ideas and incorporating them isn't being bipartisan. It is how you work with people. Since you know him as an Illinois senator and a state senator you know he is a lazy legislator. He made a number of voting mistakes and was rarely prepared for meetings. He talked frequently about hating how legislation works. McCain was a guy who would frequently reach out to new democrats to work with them. There is the now famous episode where McCain reached out to him in the early days and Obama blew him off. McCain brought this up in one of the debates.

But back to my original point. Cherry picking ideas is not bipartisanship. If it were, you would have to consider Bush bipartisan in some areas such as increasing spending on education, the prescription drug plan funding for AIDS initiatives. But then you would reply by pointing out how those actions didn't go far enough, or were half hearted. How you would respond to any attempt on my part to talk about Bush being bi partisan save yourself time because that is how Obama's so called bipartisan actions are also thought of. 

What I would give you is that early on Obama was politically savvy. He has lost some of his mojo recently. But if he gets the economy going and tops the incessant repudiation of republicans in an adolescent manner he will be back stronger. Making claims that the stimulus bill will accomplish something when it doesn't, tying healthcare reform to economic recovery like Bush tied Iraq to WMD, and living like king Louis when we are headed into a double dip recession doesn't help his mojo.

"I would take anything PolitiFact says with a grain of salt. There are multiple significant inaccuracies and omissions of facts. Here are two significant examples:

""Restore habeas corpus rights for ""enemy combatants"""" is marked as [stalled](http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/181/restore-habeas-corpus-rights-for-enemy-combatants/).

This is an utter lie, Obama has been working very diligently to take what is left of habeas corpus away:

""On February 20, 2009, the Department of Justice under President Barack Obama announced it would continue the policy that detainees in Afghanistan could not challenge their detention in US courts.[19]""

""On April 2, 2009 US District Court Judge John D. Bates ruled that those Bagram captives who had been transferred from outside Afghanistan could use habeas corpus.[20]""

""The Obama administration appealed the ruling. A former Guantanamo Bay defense attorney, Neal Katyal, led the government's case.[21][22] The decision was reversed on May 21, 2010, the appeals court unanimously ruling that Bagram detainees have no right to habeas corpus hearings""

Apparently being sued to restore habeus corpus, pursing the case, losing, appealing and then winning = Obama trying to restore habeus corpus.

---

Another problem is Obama's promise to protect whistleblowers. It is marked as [""In the works.""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/426/increase-protections-for-whistleblowers/)

This is another blatant lie. The article's justification for this? ""On one hand, Obama pledged to support more protections so federal workers will feel free to call attention to problems. But the administration has emphasized it does not want those protections to lead to the release of sensitive information. Likewise, Obama balked at language that Congress included in an appropriations bill that said Congress could revoke the salary of anyone who tried to prevent a fellow federal worker from communicating with Congress. Obama's signing statement said the executive branch's department heads could ""supervise, control or correct"" communications with Congress.""

So basically the executive branch can continue to censor as well as reduce pay for whistleblowers. And it can still prosecute whistleblowers if the information was secret. Because a lot of whistleblowing is done on public information, right?

Further more, Obama launched a manhunt for Julian Assange, and the way Bradley Manning case has been handled doesn't exactly match his stated policy: ""Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance""

Lastly, many organizations have said that Obama's handling of whistleblowers is worse than Bush's. ""The indictment of Mr. Drake was the latest evidence that the Obama administration is proving more aggressive than the Bush administration in seeking to punish unauthorized leaks. In 17 months in office, President Obama has already outdone every previous president in pursuing leak prosecutions""

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/us/politics/12leak.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;amp;hp

Daniel Ellsberg (you know, the guy who released the Pentagon Papers) said, ""Obama, in this and other matters relating to secrecy and whistleblowing, is doing worse than Bush. His violation of civil liberties and the White House's excessive use of the executive secrecy privilege is inexcusable.""

All this information is missing from the page, which marks ""Increase protections for whistleblowers"" as In the Works...",-1

No. The statement was racially charged because racists use it. Since it is used by racists more than non-racists it takes on a racist tone. Everyone drives cars- cars aren't racist. Not everyone says Obama was elected purely because of his race.,1
"Thank you! I'm a true conservative. I want liberty. I want a fair interpretation of the Constitution. I want a small government that doesn't interfere too much with our lives. Which is why I support pro-choice and less regulation. 

I don't want no regulation, Christian based laws, outlawing of abortion, destroying liberals, etc. etc. 

I think we need to respect others' choices. I have liberal friends. I disagree with their stances, but I don't decry them as idiots. I merely debate with them. If they present a stronger argument then mine, I often change my stance. If I don't change, I just say, ""Ok, that's your idea. I'll stick with mine for now.""

I also believe in global warming. It's manmade. Obama isn't a Muslim, nor was he born in Kenya. I'm anti-war. The WTC may not be as we've been told. Fox News is idiotic.

Although I'm Christian, I believe in evolution and the big bang. The Bible shouldn't be taken literally. In fact, I feel that God withheld that information from us at the time because it was too much for us. The Earth is over 4 billion years old, not 6000. There is a midpoint where religion and science can agree. God is the source of the scientific source. At least, that's what I believe. If you think something different, cool.

"OK, one by one:

&gt;   1.    he ran on main st v wall st. so talking about it only a year after still makes a lot of sense.

Yeah, why would the pied piper stop playing?

&gt;   2. Dems and repubs do need to unite, because at the moment repubs wont even join the debate unless they get everything they want, which counters everything obama is trying to accomplish and then dont vote for it anyways.

You seem to have absolutely no clue what the health care bill entails.  I will sum it up for you very quickly: all regulation on any industry is at heart a proposal to include an element of violence into otherwise voluntary scenarios.  This will inevitably create a disparity of wealth in some manner, and it is extremely, extremely likely that this disparity will be in the favor of those who already have a disparity, as those are the ones usually bribing the politicians.

&gt;   3. The president doesnt write laws... congress does. Congress has the right to levy taxes. I dont completely agree with how the taxes comes from the people and for what, but at least get upset about something you can be upset about.

And yet he assumes the authority to propose laws!  Remarkable how that works.  It's almost like he's a dictator or something.

&gt;   4. A root canal you have to have done even if its not a perfect experience. the bailout HAD to happen or every person, that is surviving on credit cards due to the damage done by bush, would have been completely shut out of what access to money they had.

It's funny, if the gold of the citizens of the U.S. hadn't been confiscated, and our currency totally debased after the government assumed a monopoly over it, that wouldn't have been a problem at all!

Of course, let's just ignore that the Federal Reserve running under Obama is even more corrupt than the one running under Bush.

&gt; 5. Obama has really said enough about war, he has to give a new speech about it every few days. When he gives his sotu he should be addressing everything that is happening with in our borders.

He hasn't said enough about it.  He hasn't ended them.

&gt; 6.    if the fee is passed on to the consumers that is the choice of the consumers to pay that fee. Welcome to the free market system.

You have no idea what ""free market"" means.  I'll give you a crash course in it.  ""FREE"" means ""WITHOUT REGULATION.""  It is not the choice of the consumers to pay that fee, because these companies have already been granted de-facto monopolies by the federal government.  It is not a consequence of the free market system if it is not a free market.

&gt; 7.   ""at some point"" really? this is an actual issue you have?

The issue is that he speaks in grandiose, warm terms without ever justifying any of what he does.  The consequence is that people like you support him blindly without having any understanding of what he does.

&gt; 8.  again this is more requirements of protecting a free market society. Did bush ever have it any of his SOTU's? last i checked...which i just did... this has been going on since at least 2000. How would you feel if you made something and worked your ass off for it, just to have it stolen because someone is to lazy to put in equal work to pay for it. That is a form of abuse.

Free markets do not have regulations.  Bush did not do it, and that severely lowers my opinion of him, as well.   A free market with regards to information, at this point in human civilization, does not have money involved in any way, because price is a function of supply and demand, and supply is, for all purposes, infinite.  

A claim of ""intellectual property"" entails a claim over the property over the means of transmission for that property.  By claiming that you have the right to prevent somebody from copying something over the internet onto their harddrive, you claim a right over both the internet infrastructure that carried that information as well as his harddrive.  Since this is obviously not the case, it is a ""right"" that is necessarily enforced by violence, and thus an illegitimate right.

&gt; 9. The states have to move first on prohibition independently. Then the country will follow. so many years of having normal constitutional process being side stepped and we all forget there is a process for these things.

No, they don't.  Take it from me, a constitutional law scholar.  The states legally have the power to nullify extraconstitutional laws passed by the federal government, but they will still be enforced nonetheless (or, possibly, another civil war will happen).  The executive branch can cease operations in an area at any point, by Obama's own directive.

&gt;  10.   deregulation of food and medicine? really? I just dont even know what to say about that.

You should say, ""great, my choice in what food and medicine I buy is no longer inhibited by violence.""

"Here again, I'm not doubting his intentions or his passion. I believe he'd have talked a good environmental game, and made some nice gestures, but I'm not convinced he'd have gotten many better policies in place. As another concrete example, take raising the CAFE standards. Bush didn't want to do this, and Gore did. On the face of that, the guy who wants to do so is better for the environment. But like every other politician in office, Gore would have been beholden to the groups that helped get him elected. One of the more powerful groups that worked for his election is the UAW. The UAW was firmly opposed to raising the CAFE standards because they bought the US automakers' line that it would cost union jobs if we did so. As a result, I do not believe Gore would have been able to raise the standards, despite his sincere desire to do so. So the net result wouldn't have made a policy difference regardless of his intentions. 

(As a thought exercise, consider the way it finally happened, under the Obama administration. The economy gave him a unique opportunity; because the bailout had just saved a ton of UAW jobs, neither they nor the car makers had the political capital to oppose his move to raise the standards, and he got it done. Gore wouldn't have the same circumstances.)

I guess all this goes to say that I think, given a set of similar circumstances, the differences between the policies of a center-right executive and a center-left executive will be small.

The one place where I see a real potential impact, now that I think about it, wouldn't be in policy at all. I do believe we'd have gotten slightly better nominees to the supreme court from a Gore administration. That's got nothing to do with what happened in war, the environment, the economy, etc. But it's a potential real difference, assuming he wouldn't have been ""Souter'd"" the way HW was. That [pattern has recurred enough](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-04-defiant-justices_x.htm) that I'm not willing to make that assumption, though.

&gt;Perhaps you're as confused about your ideas as I'm of your posts.

Make no mistake about it, you are confused because you are too busy trying to pigeonhole me so you can assume my position to actually read my position and give it a fair shake.

&gt;Bush started doing what he did after the economy failed. Obama had to because the economy wasn't going anywhere.

Insignificant difference.  They both did the same thing: bailed out big business to keep them from going under to stimulate the economy while allowing countless little guys to go under.  Sure, maybe Obama through an extra couple of bones to the middle and lower classes than McCain would have, but the bulk of the money still flowed almost directly into the pockets of big business in America.

&gt;Please explain to me how exactly would it have helped the people if Obama had left industries and banks to fail.

Please explain to me where I said he should have let the banks go under.  You asked me to show how they were similar in major things that actually affect our lives and I did just that.  Now you are asking me to support something I did not say.

&gt;Do you think a President should reverse every ""mistake"" of his predecessor the moment he/she takes office, or even couple of years down the road without regard to its repercussions?

I am not talking about undoing.  I am talking about expanding it in the same exact way.  Bush accelerated the ""secrecy and executive power for national security"" and not only did Obama keep secrecy/power at the same level, he furthered them as well.  He is eroding our liberties just like Bush did and, presumably, McCain would have as well.

&gt;I can see you weren't listening when Obama was talking about Afghanistan before the elections.

No, what you see is that you cannot debate someone who doesn't say exactly what you want them to say.  Let me tell you what we are debating about, again.  The argument was that when it comes to things that matter, Obama is barely different than McCain would have been.  I didn't say that Obama went back on his promise, only that we would still be in Afghanistan and Iraq in about the same manner regardless of who got into office.  And sure, McCain might have slightly increased our presence there while Obama slightly decreased our presences there. . . however, outside how it is presented to the people, those positions are nearly identical.  We still have about the same level of troops there, we are still committed for the foreseeable future, we are still mindlessly dumping money into that country.  If you really want to pretend that a slight decrease is significantly different than a slight increase and that they both wouldn't have been talking about a ""responsible exit"", I am not sure how I can help you see the light.",0

Nobody thinks voting matters or writing their congress matters and given that the ""great hope Obama"" has basically reversed on everything he ran under and carbon-copied Bush and in a lot of ways made things worse ... it's pretty obvious they are right.

The issue isn't that people don't care, it's that they don't think it will make a difference.",10

"What Obama said he was going to do and what the left wing of the Democrats said Obama was going to do were two different things.

Remember, Presidents are not Prime Ministers - they do not command the legislature and they do not control their own political party.

Presidents are more like Chiefs of Police. They have considerable sway over how much effort they will put into enforcing various laws, but they cannot make or change those laws themselves.

Despite the way we all like to blame the President for everything that goes wrong: ""It's Bush's fault!"", ""Look what Obama did now!"" their powers are indirect at best. They can try to convince Congress to do what they want - but if Congress does not go along, they cannot do anything.

"&gt;Republicans are pushing to have this conf committee televised because they think that will help slow down or torpedo this bill.

Why do you keep seeking to inject Republicans into this debate?  

A Democratic President promised to televise all of this.  Now we have a Democratic super-majority in Congress not doing what a Democratic president promised to do and you're trying to blame Republicans?  

The motives of the Republican party are irrelevant to Obama's promises of transparency.

&gt;Just like every piece of legislation, ever.

That's why a lot of us singed on for ""change"".  Remember that?

&gt;You're saying it like this is something out of the ordinary. Bills are written ""behind closed doors"". They're then presented for a vote. There's debate.

See the above point.

&gt;I'm suggesting you/we are focusing on the wrong part of the debate, and playing into Republican hands.

Well gee, I think we would all love to focus on what's actually going on with the bill but it's kind of tough when it's all done behind closed doors and jammed through Congress before the people even know what the hell is going on.

&gt;This isn't real transparency, and is only being proposed to impede passage of this legislation.

Wait, you do know that Obama is the one who proposed this right?  Did Obama propose transparency on the campaign trail in order to impede the passage of legislation that he backs? ",11
"I think he knows the precise context. That doesn't make ""It was bad when Bush did it; therefore it is okay if Obama does it"" a good argument.

"I did, and it doesn't.  The anecdotes/quotes from *individual's* certainly do, however.

"&gt; Why is this so hard to understand? 

Because your point is predicated on the fact that since they just showed one black man with a gun that there weren't white men there with guns. What is so hard about that? 

&gt;  Strangely, people here don't ever seem to give Fox News the same type of free pass.

Hmmmm, let's see the difference, a book comes out which has a quote which you would expect someone to actually have done their research on vs selectively and intentionally editing videos to attack others. Yeah, totally the same... The fact that you think that the two are even close to the same level is utterly stupid.

To add: I think that it's utterly silly that all you can come up with is two dubious examples which in the grand scheme of things are really minor. Why don't you try showing me some examples where MSNBC propagated lies about legislation like faux (ex. Death panels and their claims that you could go to jail if you don't pay for insurance), lies about individuals (ex. claiming that Obama wasn't born in America), or lies about organizations (ex. the bullshit that took down ACORN and the whole fabrication of ""climate gate""), and general lies (like their whole long term denialism of the science behind our understanding of climate change). When you can show me lies from MSNBC that are that insane, that are that downright fraudulent, then I'll listen to you. For now all you have is a mis-attributed quote, and a silly claim which amounts to they didn't show the white people that they were talking about. ",0

Well of course the article designed to make you question the bill didn't highlight the good it would do.  I'm not an idiot for not only looking to a single article on huffington post to determine the value of the bill.

&gt;Would, could, doesn't matter. The point is it didn't. Of course, this time it will be different right?

You're missing my point, which is that health reform needs to be an ongoing process.  Medicare didn't become more-expensive-than-anticipated because medicare was inherently corrupt or stupid or wrong, it became expensive because our entire healthcare system is out of control.  Yes, I think this time it will be different because we've got an opportunity to keep changing the system for the better.  This gets the ball rolling.

&gt;Oh yes, the threat of 'if we don't pass this bill will never pass anything'. I love that one.

You think that the political situation is trending more progressive or something?  It's not a threat to say that we wouldn't be able to pass another healthcare bill, it's a *fact*.  

You guys somehow think that if we start the process over now we can get rid of a weak bill for a MUCH stronger one, and it would be laughable if it wasn't so god damn sad.  It's a simple denial of reality, and if you aren't willing to look at the real world political situation there's really nothing I can say.  The proof is staring you in the face every day.  You think the republicans, the glenn becks, the conservative democrats and the insurance industry are going away?  You think that if obama was ""brave"" or pelosi had ""balls"" or reid wasn't ""scared"" that we could have universal healthcare right now?  That interpretation is cartoonish and hollywood, it has nothing to do with planet earth.  You aren't the hero of a tv special that just has to stand up for what's right for everything to solve itself.

I was obviously being sarcastic. The point is why would Obama care if reporters can view the scene? He doesn't care. BP may and maybe BP told the Coast Guard that amateur reporters were crawling all over breaking equipment. It seems like the default here is to assume Obama has some sinister plan to block reporter access. This just does not make any sense.

I don't give a shit if it was good for Obama- it's far more important that what's right for everyone be addressed.

**Of course. Did you expect the United States to leave their CIA officers hung out to dry while performing U.S. business? The story that matters here is Extraordinary Rendition, which we have known about for a long time. It would have been more shameful to hear that the U.S. both instructed it's employees to abduct and torture, and then turned them over to foreign authorities for prosecution.**

&gt; The U.S. worked to obstruct Spanish government investigations into the killing of a Spanish journalist in Iraq by U.S. forces, the use of Spanish airfields for the CIA's ""extraordinary rendition"" program and torture of Spanish detainees at Guantánamo (El Pais, 12/2/10; Scott Horton, Harpers.org, 12/1/10).

** Once again, the United States is doing nothing surprising and nothing less than you would expect any country to do. The problem here is still at the root, not how we try to clean it up later. We shouldn't have been in Iraq, we shouldn't have done extraordinary rendition and we shouldn't have tortured at Gitmo.**

&gt; WikiLeaks coverage has often emphasized that Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh reassured U.S. officials that he would claim U.S. military airstrikes in his country were the work of Yemeni forces. But as Justin Elliot pointed out (Salon, 12/7/10), the United States has long denied carrying out airstrikes in the country at all. The secret attacks have killed scores of civilians.

Despite the conclusions reached in the cable, official U.S. statements remained ambiguous. If the Obama administration had reached the same conclusion in public as was made in the cable, the outcome of the coup might have been very different.

** The Ambassador != Whitehouse. People act like the cables are written law. This was one opinion, albeit an important one, that shaped the Government's response.**

&gt; The U.S. secured a secret agreement with Britain to allow U.S. bases on British soil to stockpile cluster bombs, circumventing a treaty signed by Britain. The U.S. also discouraged other countries from working to ban the weapons, which have devastating effects on civilian populations (Guardian, 12/1/10).

** Read the cable for yourself. The UK was working to move their ban from permanent storage back from 2018 to 2013. The United States solicited temporary exceptions so they could simply move the munitions between a Diego Garcia (port?) to planes. **


--U.S. diplomats in Georgia were uncritical of that country's claims about Russian interference, a dispute that eventually led to a brief war (New York Times, 12/2/10). U.S. officials ""appeared to set aside skepticism and embrace Georgian versions of important and disputed events....as the region slipped toward war, sources outside the Georgian government were played down or not included in important cables. Official Georgian versions of events were passed to Washington largely unchallenged.""

At one point Stewart pointed out that Obama didn't really answer the question, and Obama quickly interrupted him to restate the original question, probably with the intent to give evidence that perhaps he was not actually dodging the question, turning some skeptical viewers into merely confused viewers.

They've opposed health care reform when their own children are uninsurable due to pre-existing conditions, and when pressed on the matter admit they have no alternatives to offer. They voted for Bush twice and stood by him as long as he was in office, but only now admit that maybe that was a mistake. They loath Obama for vague, ill defined reasons like ""He's smug"" or ""He's arrogant"", but they can't quite describe what he's done that's arrogant, or why that's even a problem for the most powerful individual person on Earth. They've claimed he was a Muslim or that he hated Christians or that he hated white people. 

I've had long discussions trying to convince an older conservative that Russian played an extremely important role in defeating Germany in WWII, far in excess of the role played by the other allies in terms of casualties. They won't believe me. They have refused to accept it. 

They excuse any evidence of the failure of Reagan era-economic policies by assigning blame to everything and anything else.

They dispatch minions across the planet to murder and rape to control resources, wealth, and power. The war in Iraq, a total farce that is consuming American and Iraqi lives, is the greatest accomplishment of Conservativism. Founded on a lie propounded out of an ideological belief and justified by access to strategic resources, an unspeakable, perfect example of patronism, war profiteering, murder for hire, the destruction wrought by mercenaries, inept planning, complete and utter failure to understand foreign cultures, unilateral bloody minded war mongering, ignorance, hatred, fear, and religiously minded crusading.

""Liberals have been wrong on a few instances, therefore they are the same as Republicans and Republican ideas should have as much support on this website regardless of their merit.""

I have a problem with that logic for a number of reasons. Ideas should be examined based upon their *individual* merit, not on which letter of the Alphabet comes after the name of the originator.

The people on this site, by and large, are educated, curious, and in my opinion, pretty fair and skeptical of dogma. The majority of the population understand logical and scientific inquiry, and if conservative/Republican ideas can't manage the energy to run that gauntlet, it's not a problem with the populace, it's a problem with the idea.

"This is what's known as an apologist response.  You then equate bush's terms with obama's so far, by not blaming either 'side'.  Let review, briefly, by listing things obama hasn't done:

1) He hasn't killed hundreds of thousands of people.
2) he hasn't created and promoted an atmosphere of fear for years on end, telling the public they aren't safe sleeping in their beds (when, restrospectively, they have been for 10+ years now)
3) he hasn't picked A_Random_Country to go haring off and attack, based on an agenda that has nothing to do with the stimulus.
4) he hasn't spent trillions of dollars that the US doesn't have, pumping death the afore-mentioned country &amp; hundreds of thousands of people.
5)on and on and on.

Seriously, it was a whole of magnitude greater evil.  Lying, cheating, back room dealing, capped off by a tax-break for the super rich. You just can't compare the two by saying 'they are both just meh'.",2
"I grew up in Murtha's district and he was my congressman for nearly 20 years.  The real truth is that he is from Johnstown, and was the lifeblood of that city.  He fought for every nickel and dime, sometimes by doing what many consider to be underhanded.  Still, he did it protecting the thing he loved.  For that, I am grateful that he served the area.

Without Murtha, Johnstown is now going to feel the full force of life after pork.  No more CTC, Lockheed Martin, or JWF.  I wouldn't be surprised if the unemployment rate shot up to 15 or 20%, just like it was when the '77 flood rolled through town.

And for anyone who says Murtha was a scumbag for pork barrel spending and luring military contracts to town...it's just like Obama said last week -- Funny how pork-barrel spending isn't pork when it's being spent in your district.

Not that I disagree -- Pork is bad, but please realize he was just trying to keep the rest of the world from pulling the life support on the town he loved.

**Edit: Woah, flood of downvotes.  What ever happened to seeing both sides of an issue?  I agree that he was a corrupt congressman and that the job got to him eventually.  All I'm trying to say is that it probably all started somewhere.  The same could happen to the Alan Graysons or Al Frankens. It's my biggest fear, but it could happen.**

**Besides, now I guarantee you some knee-jerk teabagger is going to climb into that seat or at least seriously contend for it.  That district isn't exactly in line with progressive thought...**",12
"&gt; In fact, I see far more racism in the Democratic party than in the Tea Parties. 

I disagree on that, but ok.

&gt; Claiming that calling Obama socialist is racist is just silly, and everyone knows that.

No, it's way to hide racism because Obama is demonstratively not a socialist.  Real socialists laugh at the very notion.  They don't like him but they don't want to say the actual reason so they resort to outright lies.

&gt; As for your ""token black"" thing, that is an example of leftist racism

That's not racism, it's an observation about why there are so few people of any color in their rallies, all you see is a sea of white.

&gt; Do you think the blacks who believe in limited government and rule of law can't think? That if you are black, you must believe in the Welfare State?

Of course not.

&gt; For a very good reason: the decline in education standards in this country coincides with the growth of federal intervention in education.

The decline of piracy in international waters coincides with the rise in global warming.  That doesn't make one the cause of the other.

Federal minimum standards of education are important in keeping competitive globally.  Left to their own devices, many states would be teaching creationism rather than science in science class; that's simply not acceptable and is frankly a form of child abuse.

&gt; The federal government is ill-suited to handle local issues.

I agree, but education is not a local issue, it's a national one as we're competing in a global economy and need to keep up.

&gt; Federalized education is harming our children, and needs to end, the sooner the better, so that we can go back to our previous high standards -- when education was universal, handled locally, and the best in the world.

That's not due to federal education, it's due to the rise of the rest of the world out of post WWII devastation.  America's golden age didn't exist because of our policies, it existed because after the war we were virtually the only ones left with a functioning infrastructure and we became the manufacturing base of the world which led to a huge rise in the middle class.  This was a fluke of history, it wasn't because we had the greatest system in the world.  That grace period is over.

&gt; Uh, those aren't victimless crimes, because running someone over with your car makes that person a victim.

They most certainly are victimless crimes.  Driving drunk in and of itself hurts no one; only when an accident happens is an actual crime committed and a victim created.  The same applies to speeding.  If you kill someone driving drunk, the actual crime isn't driving drunk, it's that you killed someone, which is already illegal; the same applies to speeding.

&gt; The notion that the Constitution doesn't mean anything, it's just this malleable document to be twisted into the current popular whim 

I never said it didn't mean anything, I said it's purposely vague and clearly intends for congress to figure out the details of actually running a government.  

The constitution merely outlines principles, not implementations.  For example, while it says the president is to be chosen by electors from each states congress, it doesn't say how said states congress should choose those electors.  The only thing that matters is that we pass laws that don't violate the constitution's basic principles, and that's what the supreme court gets to decide.

The constitution was setup from the start as a living document, meant to be changed and interpreted with the current times, that's why it's vague and amendable.

&gt; The idea of the Constitution was to enshrine our individual rights, for all time, not ""until we can convince a majority to vote against the minority"".

That's simply incorrect.  The constitution itself can be amended by a large enough majority, even to overturn individual rights.

What's absurd, is the idea that the constitution is some tablet of stone handed down by ancient wise men that should never be touched.  The world changes, and our system of government *must* change with it.",1

There is a possibility that Obama could end DADT with an executive order, but he feels (rightly IMO) that since it took an act of congress to enact it, an act of congress should be used to repeal the law.  This line of thinking is not THAT far away from what you obviously claim to support.

You've harped on DADT several times...do you really think a GOP majority will ever pass a repeal?  The fact that you so openly will support a group that couldn't be farther from your ideals is why trying to appeal to voters like you is pointless.",4
"&gt; Find me cases where there are factual inaccuracies in Maddows reporting.

You clearly don't understand bias. Bias isn't a question of inaccurate statements, but of implying and misconstruing.

For example, whenever talking about Obama, I might use his whole name and reeeally emphasize the Barack **HUSSEIN** Obama part. There is nothing factually inaccurate about that, right? But that doesn't mean it isn't showing bias and an attempt to appeal to people's fear/hatred of Muslims.

And in the same vein, Maddow and Olbermann routinely emphasize and report the things that represent their ideological opponents in a bad light, they routinely editorialize the news, they routinely make certain facial expressions and use certain vocal tones to signify disapproval. And of course their ideological allies get the reverse treatment. And that's called *bias*.

""Myth No. 1: There is no Social Security trust fund. What isn't in the trust fund is a big hoard of cash. Three-quarters of the money that's collected in Social Security taxes goes right out the door again in the form of benefits to Social Security recipients. The surplus that isn't needed to pay benefits is loaned to the federal government to pay for other programs.

In return for this loan, the trust fund gets IOUs in the form of special-issue, interest-paying Treasury bonds. The interest isn't paid in cash, however; the Treasury issues the fund additional bonds for the interest amount. In 2006, the fund was credited with more than $102 billion in interest; the total value of the securities is about $2 trillion.""

"More than anything, we need an executive whose primary goal is governmental reform.  Many of us thought Obama was that person.

"&gt;She was far more effective than she gets credit for

I disagree. What I see when I look back at the last 2 years is squandered opportunity. Rather than utilize the surge of public support, Pelosi and Reid attempted to shoehorn their agenda and dare the Republicans to vote against it. Which they did, while simultaneously creating a catchy narrative. 

Rather than drafting bills that dealt with issues one at a time and forcing Republicans to take a stand, she and Reid chose to slip in items that they knew Republicans would not support in order to make the Republicans appear to vote against common sense. 

I place much of the blame for Obama's lackluster start on her and Reid. 

Furthermore, even if she *wasn't* a disaster, the voting public clearly views her as such. Members of her own party insisted they were never her allies and would undermine her. She became synonymous with the public's problems with Congress. Fair or not, she needed to step down for the good of the party.

"Alright, so out of a five minute video, you've got bush mentioned indirectly concerning his policies, by what appears to be an actual libertarian, which would suggest it's more about war policies and issues like the patriot act and a degradation of rights rather than an issue with spending, though nothing specific about his complaint was mentioned other than '[obama] not holding up to his ends of the bargins'.  What Bush policies is he sighting?  What exactly did he have an issue with?  Also, love the infowars.com sign in the background, nothing brings legitimacy to your movement like alex jones.  In any case, if it's not that unusual of a sentiment (being angry with bush policies), i'm sure you could find, oh, 5 more examples without any issue, right?  I ask this because I've actually been trying to find examples of bush being sited by tea party-ers and I actually haven't been able to find much of anything.

Your argument about 'why those particular signs are newsworthy' could be twisted around very easily to say why was this video of these particular people put together?  Does it mesh with a very message the teaparty would like to present?  I'm guessing that a dude wearing a 'don't tread on me' tshirt is likely going to present his own party in as appealing light as possible, and any signs that don't reflect his message he wants to present would be marginalized and ignored.  

I would think that if i was tuned into left wing news sources, which both dislike bush and dislike the tea party, hearing the tea party complain about bush would be a news story around the lines of 'tea party eats itself alive' or something similar.  How would the left wing news sources NOT get a big hardon to see the tea party go against bush, since they dislike both?

Also, a question that I don't have an answer for and is just a question of genuine curiousity, if we compare Obamas spending and tax cuts (the idea being that tax cuts are a loss of income and in an indirect way spending in itself) vs Bushs spending and tax cuts, who would end up 'spending' the most?",1
"&gt;So the lesson is we should kill Independants because they keep putting Republicans in power ?

No? I didn't say anything like that. Independents in this country *always* put whoever's in power in power. Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have anything near 50%.

&gt;No no that's not how you win as politics. What you do is tell people what they want to hear and then do whatever you want. You can't change these people's mind through rational or logic. You just pick the most average views which appeal to the most people and shove that message down their throats in the nicest way possible. Then once in office you use your better sense to improve the nation and if you meet that net goal you will be considered a good President and you and your party will benefit.

Not at all. All titles like this one do is make the other side tune you out. The Right-media puts out titles like this all the time. Do you read them? Do their points sink in? No.

People's opinions *do* change. Mine being one of them. It took hours of debate spread out over months, but it happened.

&gt;The Democrats cannot unite in any useful way really but yea they should just steal all the conservative talking points because it's not as if the GOP has really ever shrunk government or cut spending. They spend vaslty more and expand government far more often, but they stick to the talking points their supporters want to hear and the massses are just too stupid to know any better.

They both expand Government. Just in different ways. Democrats expand bureaucracy/regulators/entitlements, Republicans expand the military and the various worthless Homeland Security branches. Both parties increase Federal and Presidential powers.

&gt;The Democrats are simply not united enough to deliver that kind of central theme and for the most part that makes them a more reliable party because lack of diversity while useful in winning elections is dangerous

Translation: They don't have a solution, and can't really even assess if it's a problem. They cannot form their position about an important issue, so instead they attack the Republicans(who are also bad, but their 'badness' doesn't change the Democrat's reality)

&gt;In summary just tell people what they want to hear to win elections and then push whatever agenda is best for the country.

Really? I voted for Obama last time, and this is the behavior that is making me not vote for him next time. I don't like being lied to. 

I'm not alone in that either. I've met many with the same opinion, and converted over several others. If lying to the voters is the Democrats recipe for success, I hope they fail and fail hard.

But, as it stands, there will *never* be a ""financially beneficial"" time to perform an audit when there is devastating news to deliver.

It doesn't matter how old a broken system is- it's up to the sitting President to address it.  But, instead, Obama re-appointed Bernanke, endorsed his Senate's blockage of the Fed audit, and hasn't exhibited any behavior demonstrating that he isn't entirely beholden to Wall Street.

"&gt;WOULDN’T it be splendid if the solutions to America’s problems could be written down in a slim book no bigger than a passport that you could slip into your breast pocket? That, more or less, is the big idea of the tea-party movement, the grassroots mutiny against big government

No it isn't.  If the people in the so-called 'tea party' movement were ***really*** upset about over-reaching government and ***really*** cared about the constitution, they'd have had the motivation and rallies they're having now when the partiot act passed or when it became obvious that the USA invaded Iraq outside constitutional authority.  Instead, they came out in large numbers when Obama was elected president.  Hell, they could have had big rallies and candidates in election during the '08 campaign, but none of that surfaced until now.

Whatever it is that motivates them, concern for the constitution isn't it from their track record, otherwise their numbers would have swelled a long time ago.  The tea party 'movement' has become a home for every crackpot, bigot, hate-spewing idiot, borderline illiterate that needs a place to vent.  While these elements are not the designated paragons of the movement, there are only two ways it can credibly claim some kind of mantle of constitutional flag-bearing: they can either genuinely stand for constitutional issues or people can echo their vapid claims to that effect.

I think if you can't call them out for what they are, call them out for what they aren't: people who ""just care about 'returning to the constitution of he founding fathers'"" whatever they think that means.  Ask them where their big rallies were when the patriot act passed, and was reauthorized.  Ask them where their big rallies showing 'concern for  the constitution' were in 2006, but which time it was obvious a country had been invaded without congressional authority, as direct and affront to a constitution drafted by men who knew well the folly of rule by a king.   

Ask them about their so-called ""return to the founding fathers' constitutionality"" when the supreme court appointed a president.  

Their movement is a home for everything *but* a move closer to the principals of the founders, for whom warrantless surveillance would have been cause for armed revolution.  They did little to nothing until a black man was elected.  Then they went from a handful of ron paul campaign contributors to swarms of fervent protesters.

"The 2003 Bush tax cuts caused what may be the [biggest increase in tax payments by the rich in American history.](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121659695380368965.html)

&gt;Washington is teeing up “the rich” for a big tax hike next year, as a way to make them “pay their fair share.” Well, the latest IRS data have arrived on who paid what share of income taxes in 2006, and it’s going to be hard for the rich to pay any more than they already do. The data show that the 2003 Bush tax cuts caused what may be the biggest increase in tax payments by the rich in American history.

&gt;The nearby chart shows that the top 1% of taxpayers, those who earn above $388,806, paid 40% of all income taxes in 2006, the highest share in at least 40 years. The top 10% in income, those earning more than $108,904, paid 71%. Barack Obama says he’s going to cut taxes for those at the bottom, but that’s also going to be a challenge because Americans with an income below the median paid a record low 2.9% of all income taxes, while the top 50% paid 97.1%. Perhaps he thinks half the country should pay all the taxes to support the other half.

&gt;Aha, we are told: The rich paid more taxes because they made a greater share of the money. That is true. The top 1% earned 22% of all reported income. But they also paid a share of taxes not far from double their share of income. In other words, the tax code is already steeply progressive.

&gt;We also know from income mobility data that a very large percentage in the top 1% are “new rich,” not inheritors of fortunes. There is rapid turnover in the ranks of the highest income earners, so much so that people who started in the top 1% of income in the 1980s and 1990s suffered the largest declines in earnings of any income group over the subsequent decade, according to Treasury Department studies of actual tax returns. It’s hard to stay king of the hill in America for long.

&gt;The most amazing part of this story is the leap in the number of Americans who declared adjusted gross income of more than $1 million from 2003 to 2006. The ranks of U.S. millionaires nearly doubled to 354,000 from 181,000 in a mere three years after the tax cuts.

&gt;This is precisely what supply-siders predicted would happen with lower tax rates on capital gains, dividends and income. The economy and earnings would grow faster, which they did; investors would declare more capital gains and companies would pay out more dividends, which they did; the rich would invest less in tax shelters at lower tax rates, so their tax payments would rise, which did happen.

&gt;The idea that this has been a giveaway to the rich is a figment of the left’s imagination. Taxes paid by millionaire households more than doubled to $274 billion in 2006 from $136 billion in 2003. No President has ever plied more money from the rich than George W. Bush did with his 2003 tax cuts. These tax payments from the rich explain the very rapid reduction in the budget deficit to 1.9% of GDP in 2006 from 3.5% in 2003.

&gt;This year, thanks to the credit mess and slower growth, taxes paid by the rich may fall and the deficit will rise. (The nonstimulating tax rebates will also hurt the deficit.) Mr. Obama proposes to close this deficit by raising tax rates on the rich to their highest levels since the late 1970s. The very groups like the Congressional Budget Office and Tax Policy Center that wrongly predicted that the 2003 investment tax cuts would cost about $1 trillion in lost revenue are now saying that repealing those tax cuts would gain similar amounts. We’ll wager it’d gain a lot less.

&gt;If Mr. Obama does succeed in raising tax rates on the rich, we’d also wager that the rich share of tax payments would fall. The last time tax rates were as high as the Senator wants them — the Carter years — the rich paid only 19% of all income taxes, half of the 40% share they pay today. Why? Because they either worked less, earned less, or they found ways to shelter income from taxes so it was never reported to the IRS as income.

&gt;The way to soak the rich is with low tax rates, and last week’s IRS data provide more powerful validation of that proposition.",-6

I'd say the Dems didn't fight hard enough, but many of them including Obama were supporting a single payer public option. They were just, as usual, to willing to compromise. 

They did put in funding for non-profit health insurance in a attempt to offer a limited public option with the chance to grow into a larger program. 

It's asshole like you preaching instant gratification over reason who are going to help the GOP win seats in 2010 and get us right back to where we were in 2000 facing a renewal of republican power. 

We haven't pushed back against corporations this hard since FDR. Getting the nation to unify behind a black President is arguable a pretty fucking hard sell. No offense just stating reality. In the past it was considerable easier to pass legislation, but years of corruption have left us with new congressional standards on what defines a majority. 

Lets also remember the Dems never had a super majority. The media may have called it that but they were including Independents like Leiberman who are more or less Republican loyalists with HUGE ties to the insurance industry. 

Don't be a child and get mad because in one year the Dems couldn't reform the last 60 years of corruption. Sure the Dems have corruption problems too, but to say those problems are anywhere near as bad as the GOP just shows your out of touch with reality. 

Republicans are not conservatives anymore, they are corporatists. Almost every one of them is a corporate loyalists who votes on party lines. The fact that Dems are not so hive minded just shows they are the party you can trust much more so than the GOP and if you understand US politics you know you have to the choose the lesser of two evils or empower the greater of two evils. 

SO it comes down to a simple question.. who is MORE on your side. The GOP or the Dems. Who pushed for health care reform. Plenty of Dems backed the public option but it only takes one vote to make the whole process pointless. 

Also where was the public outrage ? Where were the protests in the streets? The public put up almost no right what-so-ever and even if they had it would be a national protest against a handful of conservative Dems whom are loyal to their state not the nation as a whole. 

The existing bill is slow acting, but it does create incentive for non-profit insurance which is effectively the same thing as a public option just decentralized. It's not an all inclusive or fast acting bill, but it's a huge step in the right direction. Of course, in the mean time premiums may vary well spike in speculation against the new market and the huge reform of not being able to deny people health care. 

Having seen first hand the suffering of those who get dropped from their insurance and are left with no options other than traveling to other nations for health care I think we've made some serious progress. 

The GOP certainly would not create regulations for making insurance more fair. They'd just tell you to suck it up and when you get old or high risk pay the 400+ a month premium with a deductible and coinsurance or die off trying. 

No being able to separate your need for instant gratification from the bigger picture of what will happen if the GOP gains power is just foolish. If they had it their way they'd repeal all insurance regulations and say if you can't pay it oh well that's the free market. ",8

**Is Obama embracing the lawless, omnipotent executive?**

&gt;According to Obama, only the President has the power to decide what is done with classified information, and neither courts nor Congress have any power at all to do anything but politely request that the President change his mind.  Therefore, the President has the unilateral, unchallengeable power to prevent any judicial challenges to his actions by simply declaring that the relevant evidence is a secret and refusing to turn it over to a court, even if ordered to do so.  That's the argument which the Obama DOJ is now aggressively advancing -- all in order to block any judicial adjudication of Bush's now-dormant NSA program.

"&gt;So, they may have pulled in 246 million in GROSS amount last year

I think  you are off by a factor of 1,000.  This [site](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/BP/financials) list total revenue for 2009 as 246,138 *million* dollars.  Net income or profit is given as:

Total Net Income (in millions)

* 2009:  16,578.00
* 2008:  21,157.00
* 2007:  20,845.00	
* 2006:  22,315.00

2009 comes to about 6% of total revenue.

&gt;And would you please comment on the those that gave BP the check plus in regards to the oil rig.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.

&gt;All I can say is that this should gothrough court proceedings.

Why?  BP knows they are financially over a barrel for this.  The [Oil Pollution Act](http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/opaover.htm) makes them liable for the cleanup no matter what *caused* the spill.  It doesn't matter if it was an accident or not. All the parties involved with the rig might be liable to some extent, but [BP is the party responsible for operating](http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=2012968&amp;contentId=7062995) the rig.  

&gt;Obama admisnistration blocking Jendal from calling a state of emergency, as well as aid in this disaster. 

Jindal declared a state of emergency [7 days](http://www.wwltv.com/news/local/Jindal-declares-State-of-Emergency-over-spill-92430299.html) after the spill started.  I don't see how the Federal government can prevent a governor from declaring a state of emergency.  If Jindal was delayed in doing so, it was his own doing.  

&gt;No one knows exactly what caused the accident entirely, so jumping to conclusions is ridiculous.

It doesn't matter what caused it, as stated above, BP (and possibly others) are liable for the clean up.  

&gt;as well as aid in this disaster.

What aid do you think has been delayed?  Media Matters put together a well documented debunking of the Fox News talking points [here](http://mediamatters.org/research/201006240025). I suppose you might be talking about the [Maine company's oil boom](http://mediamatters.org/research/201006240025#11), or perhaps the delay in approving the [berm construction project](http://mediamatters.org/research/201006240025#12), or the docking of [oil skimming barges](http://mediamatters.org/research/201006240025#13)

The Obama administration declared it a spill of national significance on April 29th (same day as Jindal's emergency declaration) with Napolitano saying, ""We can now draw down assets from across the country, other coastal areas, by way of example; that we will have a centralized communications because the spill is now crossing different regions."" 

&gt;Unfortunately, could Obama not want to override the Jonses' act because of the unions?  

Another [myth.](http://mediamatters.org/research/201006240025#9) Here's another [source...](http://factcheck.org/2010/06/oil-spill-foreign-help-and-the-jones-act/)

&gt;The Deepwater Horizon spill has yet to affect infrastructure or oil and gas availability; the damage is environmental, and foreign vessels are approved for delivering resources and conducting offshore skimming.  Although the Jones Act is currently not applicable, the federal government has taken steps to expedite the waiver process should the oil spill response require a Jones Act waiver for trade and commerce.

"&gt; The Taliban were pretty brutal and repressive....the current Karzai court is far more insidious and corrupt than the Taliban could ever dream to be

Note that I was asking about pre-Taliban. What were the governments during the Russian invasion and the civil war like? I believe that Karzai's administration encompasses many power brokers from that era...

&gt; the Iraqi's are in noway capable of carrying the security load and the US can't afford it further falling into Iran's sphere of influence

Yes, definitely a factor in this. I guess the litmus test is whether the Iraqis, backed by the ""non-combat"" US troops, can hold the situation over the next year. If the people who are continuing the insurgency campaign understand this, then it means that their aims are to _keep_ the US in Iraq rather than evict them. Ceasing violence for the next 12 months would give the US no excuse but to withdraw the military, given the public proclamations around this. (This is not some shady SOFA deal negotiated out of the spotlight.)

&gt; The sanctions will have an impact, but that will not of any immense consequence.

Possibly! The new tactic of imposing personal sanctions against specific power brokers may have an effect. And the (CIA provoked?) wave of protest last year around the elections is also interesting. FWIW even if Iran does get a nuke, I don't see it using it in aggression; if I was a large Muslim country within striking distance from Israel, I'd want a nuke too.

&gt; All you have to see is the current issue with Israel resuming the settlement building.

This is a major policy plank for Obama; he has incentive to make the talks continue, as it's just about time for the 2012 presidential campaign to start kicking off. I predict that the Israelis will be forced to make a deal in the backroom where publicly they don't have to put a stop to construction, but that the pace of the construction will be extremely slow, and that Abbas will (again in the backroom) agree to not withdraw from the talks, on this basis. (FWIW: There is a changing of the guard going on in the Obama administration -- Axelrod is leaving to focus on the election campaign, I'm hoping Emmanuel goes (to pursue mayorship), and of course Summers and Orszag are out. Obama knows he is weak on the left; I'm fully expecting him to hire left to reignite some passion in his 2012 campaign; thus, his policies are going to shift left, also.)

The bailouts are a complete utter failure. They have robbed the american taxpayer. They have not done anything meaningful to change the bank's behaviors that got us in the mess in the first place. The banks are back to their same old tricks. Problems NOT solved. Americans are now going to be robbed through the hidden tax of INFLATION because the fed has to resort to printing money. The ignorance of so many Americans such as yourself really bothers me. We are far from making any profits from all the trillions spent ""rescuing"" the banks and wall-street.

"Last I checked, Obama started with a 1.3 Trillion deficit.. so to double it would mean the deficit is now 2.6 Trillion, which is obviously not true. In fact his first year (2009) saw a budget deficit of 1.75 trillion, a ~34% increase, in order to bail out banks and also tax income shortfalls. The budget deficit for 2010 is projected at 1.17 Trillion, which is a ~10% Reduction from Bush's last year, and a 33% reduction from Obama's first year. The current projection shows a deficit of $533 Billion by 2013, which is a ~59% reduction from Bush's last year, which is more than Obama promised.

So tell me again how he doubled the deficit?

"&gt; Yes, I declared it to be true that the federal government under President Bush did try to do something. This is a fact, you cannot dispute it. You can also not dispute that it was not supported by conservatives because it included amnesty for those already here.

No, it's the ""grasping at straws"" crap.  How many times do I need to make the point that the only disagreement I have is whether or not this is some kind of racist, mean-spirited, fuck-the-brown-skinned people sentiment?  What am I supposed to make of talking to my neighbors, friends, friends of friends, and strangers in Jiffy Lube about this *right here in Pima County, Arizona* and have people in places like Seattle tell me, ""You don't know Arizonans like I KNOW ARIZONANS.""  Seriously - it's like, oh my god, the simplistic dialog of a state full of terrible people has been thrown into question - oh how will I subsist on the blanket disdain I need to go on?

Do you see my point?

Amnesty was rejected because amnesty is not acceptable.  To claim that this is the only solution; that because people have rejected this singular concept, that it must be because of blanket hatred, is ludicrous.  

People reject amnesty because they reject giving benefits to people they think broke a law.  This is not hate; it is a particular way of looking at law and order.  The point I have been trying to make before it got drowned in this masturbatory ""let's just rank on Arizona incessantly"" campaign was that crossing an imaginary line in the desert is an administrative misdemeanor at best, and that most people, if the situation were reversed, would cross south to Mexico if they needed to do so to feed their family.  That this is not this epic ""invasion"" that people keep claiming it is.  Listening to you and pretty much everyone I encounter mid-froth, it's as if I'm down here in Klan robes egging it on.

Well forget reasonable argument now that this has become about carpetbaggers telling Arizona what to do after doing shit to bear border enforcement costs over the last ten years, especially now that basically it's all about namecalling and boycotting people collectively, many of whom didn't support this and had nothing to do with it.  Like the sheriff of my own county who is refusing to support it.  Like the constituency of my county, which voted for Obama in 2008 and Kerry in 2004, and had no taste for this law.

A law which, I might add, was passed by an unelected governor.

&gt; So once again, let me know when the people of Arizona want to get serious about the issue and have a plan that goes beyond simply securing the border. People risk their lives to get here, and you think a fence is going to stop them? 

No, why are you asking me, or does this whole, ""read what I said"" thing only work one way?  I am making the point that the tone of this debate is just strengthening Arizona identity.  It is just making it harder to have any kind of discussion with people since this isn't about immigration anymore but, basically, federalism of sorts.

&gt; You have no way, just talking points that will accomplish nothing.

Realistically speaking *your* talking points have accomplished nothing since amnesty, which you seem to feel is some kind of law of physics, which unless respected dooms the border to disorder and anarchy, have accomplished nothing.

&gt; So go on supporting a law that will accomplish nothing and is simply political theater.

Which just makes your ""don't take what I said out of context"" bit really remarkable since, and I will quote for your edification:

&gt; I don't disagree with amnesty at all. Of course, I don't even believe in borders.
 
&gt; I'm an anarchist who doesn't even believe in borders.

&gt; I don't disagree with amnesty at all.

I don't support this law.  It blows my mind, that not just here in this conversation, but in every one I've had online, people can't seem to process the idea that I can disagree with this law, be anti-racist, anti-profiling, ANTI-STATE, and still be intellectually honest enough to point out that the allegations about the character and motivation of Arizonans as a whole are distorted and unfair.

"I'd like to pluck a line from the Washington Post article.  I believe it correctly sums up my position.

&gt; Certainly, the quality of this legislative output is a matter of debate.

I won't delve into the specifics of the bank bailouts and TARP -- needless to say I think that the government was over-generous and that the financial institutions were shielded from far too much pain, to the point where I can't really think of a reason (from their perspective) not to make the crisis happen again.  The GM catch-and-release takeover was a much better model and should have been the standard from the get-go.  

But the main sin of the Obama administration, in my opinion, has been a terminal lack of ambition.  Notice how Bush had a uncooporative Congress and yet *still* managed to ram through his unsupported tax cuts via Reconciliation.  What Obama has failed to realize is that the Congress has been California-ized -- blind, unreasoning opposition has become a valid political tactic.  Bush was adept at using Reconciliation bills (and the threat of Reconciliation bills) to force through his changes.  And yes, despite the fact that the Constitution states that the Legislature is responsible for such things, the Bush White House was responsible for supplying the will and the energy behind such endeavors... qualities the Obama administration sorely lacks, despite Emmanuel's vaunted reputation for toughness.  That man turned out to be the biggest paper tiger I've ever seen.

Then we have the wars.  Those stupid, stupid, stupid wars.  Obama is establishing a permanent and costly presence in Iraq at a time when we're being eaten alive by our deficit, while escalating an absolutely hopeless conflict in Afganistan.  I just want to weep.  Why is he doing this?  Why?  He could take a strong position, pull out, and declare that he's saved America from fiscal, military, and moral disaster.  But he doesn't.  Why, why, why?  To say nothing of Guantanamo.  He could disperse those prisoners and close what's known to the world as the US Torture Camp with a stroke of a pen.  But he doesn't.  He's obsessed with getting Congress to sign off on the decision so he's not out there, taking a risk alone.  Its so very sad.

I can go on, and on and on and on.  You've probably picked up on that.

So, cap and tax, control, lots of big bucks for Obama's buddy Immelt who wants to sell way too expensive wind and solar, and lots more money and power for Obama.  The flim-flam, scam, fraud, hoax of the threat of *climate change* is just an excuse.  Really just have the Federal Government control, nearly take over, all of our electric utility industry.  Money and power for Obama!

Next up excuse:  100 Mbps Internet for everyone, that is, have Obama take over the Internet.  Money and power in DC for Obama.

Next up excuse:  Education!  Have US education run from DC!  Money and power in DC for Obama.

"If Obama does not push for federal enforcement of anti-drug laws in California after a vote for legalization, then he very much has something to do with it.

It's just the local authorities in California that are the problem right now.  I can't see any reason for Obama to change course on legalized marijuana in California if the law is approved.  I could be wrong, but the trend seems to bear me out.

As for the Russia deal, I think that it has a big effect on everything.  Despite the cooling of the Cold War, we still have thousands of nuclear missiles on both sides that could be used at any time.  A major reduction of warheads goes a long way towards making us a little bit safer.  Yes, we could still easily destroy the world many times over, but at some point we'll be in a position where nuclear war won't be very easy to do.  These reductions are VERY important.  They make us safer, they make the world safer, and they make it easier for us to pressure other governments not to build nuclear weapons.",6

""And in order to reach the space station, we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable.

Now, I recognize that some have said it is unfeasible or unwise to work with the private sector in this way. I disagree. The truth is, NASA has always relied on private industry to help design and build the vehicles that carry astronauts to space, from the Mercury capsule that carried John Glenn into orbit nearly 50 years ago, to the space shuttle Discovery currently orbiting overhead. By buying the services of space transportation -- rather than the vehicles themselves -- we can continue to ensure rigorous safety standards are met.

"I am not here to defend all of his moves or motives. I could but I find that just degrades the argument into ""let me defend Obama entirely"". 


I don't think that is reasonable because I do disagree with him on a lot of issues. But I do also think that the bigger argument is that there are political realities that you are not even considering in this statement. And I don't believe those are mutually exclusive thoughts. 


Let me give you an example while still trying not to degrade the argument into ""but look at this policy"".Let's go with war. 


You are right. He could end the wars. But the military complex is so extreme that he would have to fire a lot of top leadership in the military. With such public fear of terrorism so prevalent do you really think there would be no political fallout? Do you think he could have even continued being President? 

In fact, lets say you were President and you retained your Presidency after making this declaration and firing the necessary individuals who would obstruct implementation. Would you have the troops leave quickly or slowly? If quickly, how would you ideally create a plan to ensure the region doesn't go so out of control that there would be additional ""threats of terror""? Would you retain a program to help the civilians rebuild? If not, how would you deal with the international fall out from that. If so, how do you ensure that you can do that safely... 


The list could go on much further and in greater detail but these are rhetorical. And don't misinterpret me. It doesn't mean to say we shouldn't stop the war. But saying ""he is commander in chief"" holds little water. 


You also say look at these decisions and ignore what political capital has accomplished. But I see mistakes and I see how he has worked to reform the student loan program, regulate wall street, invest billions in green technology, restore funding for parks and restoration programs, fight against obscene and manipulative credit card practices... etc. 


You can argue that some of his political strategies and decisions were unsuccessful or just wrong but I fundamentally disagree with the notion which you were projecting. Which was that he just switched those positions almost on a whim. And that doing so has gained this country and his constituents nothing. 


We need higher levels of political discourse then those broad sweeping generalizations.

"Which democrats are threatening to ""take kucinich out in the primaries""?  You seem to have a bizarre conception of reality.

There probably isn't a person in this country who wanted that bill passed more than Obama, even if you are looking at purely cynical self-interest.  He's maybe cut some deals you don't like, and I don't like them either, but how can you take an honest look at the political situation and say those deals weren't necessary?

Democrats love the idea of blaming the Republicans for a higher deficit, when in reality, the Democrats started spending money we don't have, increasing our deficit.  Then they want to blame Republicans for ""increasing"" the deficit.

"**10 Clues That You are Talking to a Mind Numbed Tea Bagger.**

Clue #1.  ""Taxes are collected at the point of a gun"".  Well, yeah, ultimately all of our laws are enforced with force, if it gets to that point, and paying ones tax is a law.  Traffic signs are enforced at the point of a gun.  Does this somehow remove the validity righteousness of a stop sign? 

Clue #2.  ""Obama Care"".  Fact is that up until just recently, the president did not present any official health care guidelines that he authored.  All the health care revisions were the product of a democratically elected government, in compliance with all laws and procedures, but calling it ""legal health care revisions from a government of the people"" would lack the emotional punch that ""Obama care"" has.  

Clue #3.  ""Socialism"" - as a pejorative.  Remember the tea bagger who held the protest sign that read ""Keep your government hands off my Medicare!""?  These people have been conditioned to believe that social or government programs are inherently evil and that police department, fire departments. public road departments, public schools, and even social security are not socialism.  They do not know what they are, but they know they are not socialism because socialism is evil.  Glenn Beck told them it was.

Clue #4.  ""Our forefathers did not trust a big government or one that governed from far away"".  I do not see anything in the constitution that cites the relative size of a government or geographical references.  What I do see it a constitution that objects to a government that is run by and for the benefit of the wealthy elite - men like George Bush, Dick Cheney, and Mitt Romney.  

Clue #5.  ""They hate our freedom"". Does anyone really think that the Islamic world that opposes us does so because we are free to pick Coke over Pepsi or vote for our favorite on American Idol or anything else that we do in the USA?   No.  They hate our freedom to support oppressive governments overseas. They hate our freedom to invade nations that pose no real threat to our safety and overthrow their governments, and they hate our freedom to impose our cultural values on entire nations, by force.

Clue #6. “Transfer of Wealth”.  This is always a reference to our government trying to undo economic hardships that the poor and middle class are experiencing as a result of tax, labor, or other laws that have unfairly transferred wealth from the poor &amp; middle class to the wealthy.  When the government repeals Glass Steagall and gives Wall Street free reign to rob &amp; pillage the savings of poor and modest hard working Americans and send these fortunes to the likes of Richard Fuld, John Thain, and Joe Cassano, that’s just the good old “free market” doing what free markets do.  It’s only when government action reverses this transfer of wealth from the wealthy to the poor and modest that such government intervention is bad.  

Clue #6. The Government Can’t Do Anything Right”.  Yes, we all know that of the two hundred plus years that out federal, state, and local governments have been in existence, there have been failures.  But those of us not limited to Talk Radio as our source of information know that our government has been quite successful in many endeavors, not the least of which have been the Hoover Dam, the interstate highway system, the cure for Polio, and do I not recall that our government put a man on the moon (several men, in fact).  An honest examination of the facts would reveal that both government and private enterprise have their equal share of triumphs and failures, but who needs an honest examination when one has an agenda to push?

Clue #7.   The tree huggers are the reason we can’t get atomic energy or more oil refineries in the USA.  Yeah, right, I get it!  The so-called tree huggers have enough political clout to stop the development of any atomic energy plants  to compete with Big Coal or oil refineries that would add competition to Big Oil, but not enough clout to stop coal plants from spewing toxic fumes into the air and mercury into the oceans, not enough political clout to stop the recent explosion of monster trucks (AKA SUV’s) on our highways, and not enough political clout to stop the mountain top strip mining for coal, a process that decimates the environment and local communities.  Somehow these tree huggers can only oppose measures that put a lot of cash into the pockets of Big Oil and Big Coal.  Further, the tree huggers in France (where atomic energy is plentiful and environmental activism is high) somehow, are the polar opposites of American tree huggers.  Maybe it had something to do with Jerry Lewis?

Clue #8. “Main Stream Media”.  Basically, the Main Stream Media is anyone who does not agree with Fox News, owned by and run by one of the largest media corporations in the world. 

Clue #9.  “Free Market”.  This is always a fun topic to discuss with a Tea Bagger for about sixty seconds, until you remind them that a free market, in order to be free, must not have any restrictions.  Anything else is government regulated market.   True, many of us may want more or different regulations than that of a tea bagger, but ultimately, they will have to admit that their vision of a free market has about the same number of regulations.  The only real difference is that their regulations benefit corporations and yours benefit citizens, aka “Socialism” (see Clue #3).

Clue #10.  “Support Our Troops”.  These brave men &amp; women are protecting our freedoms (Clue #5) in traveling a vast distance to rule over others (Clue #4) and somehow they are government employees but not bad ones (Clue #3) and they are doing something right in spite of Clue #6.  How do we support them?  We do so by paying our taxes at the point of a gun (Clue #1).  Yes, many of us would rather support them by bringing them home and stopping the wars, but that is just a falsehood spread by Clue #8.

Reagan, Bush I and Bush II presided over recessions. Recessions make the deficit explode by combining lower revenues with higher social safety net payouts.

Which is not to say that policies don't matter. A contributing factor to the Clinton years was the post cold war ""peace dividend"". Another was that he raised taxes (revenue). Meanwhile our current deficits come from three main places - 1. Afghanistan 2. Iraq 3. The Bush Tax Cuts. The bailouts and stimulus package are a distant third.

What's interesting is that the crowd which claims to be the most concerned with deficits (Republicans and Tea Partiers) absolutely despise every President who took real steps to really address the problem - Obama, Clinton, and Bush I.

"&gt; Injustice is prevailing and it has absolutely nothing to do with the influence of any supernatural forces. Injustice prevails mostly because of ignorance or apathy of the common man.

You are right in the sense that ignorance does create a lot of injustice, however I dont feel like getting into the solid intellectual, rational proof for Islam being the truth and thus proving the existance of supernatural forces- my fingers are tired from typing that out 10 million times on reddit. I will instead give a simple counter-example to what you said, and thats someone like Obama, who is continuing these war and injustices? He was elected in large part because he seemed to be a ""common man"" (certainly compared to the likes of Dick Cheney), and I doubt he's that ignorant.

&gt; Religion is a strong tool for creating both ignorance and apathy. Highly religious people are often very ignorant to anything outside of their own faiths.

There's one thing I dont get, and thats why people like yourself that claim to be rational/logical constantly use use that classic example of fallacy of composition argument to claim all religion is manmade/false.

&gt;That's simply because life's details become less interesting when you have a simple magical explanation for everything and a very narrow goal. People stop being detectives and scientists and devolve into witchdoctors and shamans.

I hope you realize that Muslims have made arguable the greatest contributions to core science and mathematics- and this was under an Islamic state (where everything, from the political system to the economic system is run in accordance with the Divine laws). I suggest you read a bit about the history of the sciences. In fact, the scientific method itself, comes from a [Muslim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_scientific_method#Ibn_al-Haytham)

&gt; The reason to restrain oneself can be logical. [excerpted sentence addressed below] There is so much more to life.

On average, your life will end in 60 years. Your hereafter is forever. Ultimately, people will be in one of two places: paradise, or hell fire. If you claim that there is no God, what exactly then is the purpose of life? To eat, drink, fuck, and amuse yourself as much as possible for as long as you can, until those 60 years run out, then you just die? Because in that case, I see no point in having any restraint. Why shouldnt I steal from my neighbor, who cares about morality or doing the right thing when it doesnt matter because my only purpose is to do whatever I want while Im still alive? 

&gt;Morality exists even without religion

Allah has placed an innate nature in the human being, when it is born, which recognizes what you might call, a natural law... it includes a readiness to believe in, and worship his Creator, and it also includes some inherent morality.. for example, the desire for justice.

However, this nature can be corrupted, due to the evil within the person, or due to evil influences from the environment, and even due to ignorance or misguidance. In fact, this is the whole idea behind propaganda- it effective gets people to believe it is morally right to do evil. Also, this natural law does not tell you how to implement it practically. For example, we desire justice, but how do you implement a fair criminal justice system? How do you measure good and evil to be able to determine what penalty for what crime, or what even constitutes a crime? If it is left to people to create their own laws democratically, it will simply be the rule of mob. So when a majority of people in this country thought slavery was good, slavery is not a crime. Now it is. Many years ago, the majority of this country viewed homosexuality as a crime. Today its accepted to the point that its a crime to discriminate against homosexuals. Where is the consistancy?

The fact of the matter is human beings are neither capable of making their own laws, nor of behaving justly, when they are their own references. This is both due to the inherent intellectual limitations of human beings, and their evil/weakness which causes them to follow their desires, instead of what is right. Im only summarizing a few elements of this argument here, but this is actually precisely one of the reasons we require divine revelation from Allah, who is All-Knowing.

&gt;I don't like what the US military is doing in the Middle East, however I don't judge every soldier to be evil because of this. Most soldiers don't believe they are serving a tyrant and also believe that their cause is just.

So where is this a-religious morality then? From the point of view of someone in Iraq, he is a mercenary and a murderer. But from his point, lets assume he thinks he's a noble hero doing something good. Why did he not see the immorality of what he was doing? Are you implying he was religious (like the nutjobs fighting to convert a land ""christ"")? In any case theres plenty of atheists and agnostics in the army too. 

And further, what is the difference between him and a mercenary? And between a mercenary and a mafia hitman? Each of them kills for money, and they all have their justifications for why its right/good/acceptable. This is the reality when morality is dictated by the human being, instead of by His Lord. And THAT, my friend, is the reason why there is all that evil- because people do not obey their Lord.. because they do not ponder deeply, and thus become certain of His existance, and become aquainted with His revelation, which bring morality and righteousness both to him as an individual, and to those around him.

&gt;I would judge a person by their intentions and not their actions.

Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, im sure they also had good(or rather, justifiable) reasons for what they did. No different from how his killing civillians in Iraq was justifiable to him.

&gt;Hatred breds only more hatred. Focus on doing something positive for humanity, rather than lashing out like you are. You're not helping.

Humans being want justice and hate oppression inherently. The very least I could do to help the cause of what is just, is register my voice of protest in a submission where most likely, the overwhelming majority will praise him and claim he is a hero, and thus raise awareness, less any one of them truly be able to delude himself into thinking he is doing something good and everyone supports what he did.",0
"Except it is an appropriate line of analysis that the question of spending only comes up when the government tries to pass social programs aimed to promote the general health and welfare of all Americans. 

The question of spending never comes up when the government wants new weapons or wants to make war.

It isn't a parallel fallacy because they are related. The argument that spending money on health care will break the bank now only comes up, but it is a non-factor when it comes war making and defense appropriations. It cannot a barrier for social welfare programs, but a non-issue in other issues that require the government to spend money.

It isn't a justification for the programs Obama wants, and no one is arguing that it is. People that argue the cost as some sort of barrier to a public option did not adequately raise concern when we have spent trillions of dollars over the last 10 years on shitty wars and a bloated defense budget. It cannot suddenly become an issue as you have presented.

This isn't a fallacy. Government policy has to be forward looking, and it requires a coherent paradigm of thought to craft meaningful legislation. If we're designing social policy in our country, and we only ask the question of spending when it applies to programs that help the common person, then there is a big problem. Where was the meaningful discussion in government about spending 10 years ago for war? Where was the meaningful discussion our most recent defense appropriations bill?

The hypocrisy is the problem.",4

"&gt;Obama very carefully frames his support of the tax cuts for the middle class and below as a means to help people in the current recession and not as an ""always support all tax cuts"". Thats part of the key here, its pragmatic and not idealistic.

I think you and I disagree on the definitions of pragmatism and idealism.  What Obama said is basically that, despite the fact that he feels it's bad policy and he knows the majority of the American people agree that it's bad policy, he's going to agree to extend all the tax cuts because he didn't want to let the middle class cuts expire.  His hostage analogy was telling; he said you never negotiate with hostage takers, unless the hostages are at risk.  The hostages are *always* at risk, and the whole point of ""don't negotiate with hostage takers"" is that doing so incentivizes future hostage takings, since criminals know you will give into their demands if they hold a gun to someone's head.

What happens next time the Republicans pull this shit, threatening to let some 'good' bill pass if they can't get their way on another issue?  Either Obama has to do what a lot of Democrats want him to be doing now with the tax debate and call the Republicans' bluff, or he has to let them get away with it again and again.  They've already shown that they have no political shame: they literally just held tax cuts to the overwhelming majority of voters hostage with a demand that increases the deficit when their entire electoral strategy was built on pledges to reign in irresponsible fiscal policy.  

If Obama won't stand his ground and fight here, when will he?  Democrats are afraid of their own shadow.  If he called the Republicans' bluff, and they refused to come back to the table and make some much bigger concessions or abandon their demands for tax cuts to the wealthy entirely, then it would be their procedural votes that would block voting to pass the tax cut extension to the middle class, and Obama and Dems in Congress can come back and say, ""look, we tried to cut taxes for 99% of Americans and the Republicans blocked us to play politics.""  Somehow, in twisted Democratic political strategy logic, they decided that would make *the Democrats* look bad.  WTF?!  Obama says he's taking Boehner at his word that he has the country's best interest at heart and would never compromise that for political gain.  If that's true, then the Republicans would have backed off.  If that's not true, then the Republicans will let him ""compromise"" his way into enacting their exact policy platform and threaten to shut down Congress any time the Dems didn't cooperate.

I understand fully that you have to be pragmatic in politics, but I don't understand why that means we shouldn't criticize the Democratic leadership's political strategy when they can't get popular policies passed while controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress.  The Dems need 60 votes to get anything done, and apparently the Republicans only need 41 to dictate the agenda.

We should have tried to force a vote on the Democratic tax plan a month or so before the election, and let the Republicans either give up and let it pass or made the fact that they blocked the vote the only issue in the election.  

I'm somewhere left of Kucinich and Sanders politically, and I'm all about strategic voting so I will continue to support the Democratic Party until a better nationally viable option becomes available, so don't take this as an Obama hater snipe, but the more I try to defend his political strategies, the more I see the comparison: Obama = Carter.  I'm not talking about policy so much as political incompetence.  I just hope we don't end up with another Reagan thanks to the Dems already destroying their historic surge in public support and voter turnout in '06 and '08.

Wow.  That started as a bullet list of a few small points and became a fucking essay.  tl;dr: I don't think it's pragmatic to pursue a political strategy that allows the minority party to force your hand simply because they have the votes for a filibuster.  There were any number of political strategies available besides, ""retreat!,"" and even letting the whole tax cut extension fail would have been better both policy wise and politically for the Democrats than what is now happening.",1

The Republican party had agreed not to run ads featuring the pastor of Obama's church from years ago. This day they did it anyway.
