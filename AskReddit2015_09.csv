"""Procreation is a biological imperative but that in and of itself does not define an objective."" 

That wasn't my argument and my entire last post was saying that that isn't the point. And yes, biology just occurred randomly, but now our genes are our creators. We were created by our genes and for our genes. When our bodies die, our genes continue to live on in our descendants. Therefore, our bodies are just temporary vessels that our genes use to propagate themselves. ",1

"A person's personal needs have nothing to do with what a particular job or task should pay.  You get paid what it's worth (to me) to cut my yard - not the fact that you have debt, needs, or emergencies.  My teenage son that needs a job to meet his after school expenses should be able to find a job and get hired because he can afford to take that job.  If my wife wants to pick up extra spending money once the kids go back to school - she should be able to leverage the fact that she can do the job cheaper than someone else in order to get the position. 

This ""living minimum wage"" is a result of the liberal's breakdown of the family and education - people today are truly too dumb and lazy to develop trades or skills. Their families are so destroyed and fragmented that what used to be a family working to survive is now one person here or there trying to provide for children and no one really taking pride in the job and working only to have the next new iPhone and flat screen.

The average employee or person on the street doesn't understand that employers are paying for workmans comp. insurance in case an accident happens to you, health insurance (sometimes), unemployment insurance for you, liability insurance that will cover any mistakes you might make. The employer must be ready to handle any allegation or claim that can be thought of. 

What he gets (many times) is a workforce that works because it has to - not because it wants to.

To top it off, everyone expects the employer to be there everyday to open the doors and provide a place a work and, they damn well better have the paycheck ready to go on payday.  But, at any time, an employee can just walk off for their job, spit on a customer's food, get into fights and curse out customers with little to no recourse for the employer - and no way to repair the public and financial damage the company may have had as a result.

When an individual employee can back up the financial impact their negative actions has on a company then there is equal risk with the rewards to being employed.  Until an employee is held truly accountable for how their actions affect the company   - people need to get their house and lives in order and see the value of family and how a family can survive and not an individual who has chosen to have kids and not keep a marriage and has no extended family that is not in the same bad shape that they are.

"Sweet Child of Mine by G n R.

When I was 14 or 15 years old, my parents adopted a little girl from Russia. She was an angel. Blond hair and blue eyes that stood out like a sore thumb in my Italian mix family. She taught me how to be a parent. II often fed her, changed her diapers, played with her, sang her songs at bedtime (Sweet Child of Mine, Don't Cry, Stairway to Heaven, Layla), and taught her how to roll her ""r"" (practiced speaking Italian). She died at 16 months old in a household accident. Everybody in the house blamed themselves for it. I was too busy playing a pirated computer game upstairs to spend time with my family. I'm under no illusions that I am culpable but  me spending time with my family would have saved her life and I never forget that. 

I still have the rocking chair I used to rock her to sleep and it has since rocked two of my siblings and two of my own children. My daughter is getting to be too old to sit in daddy's lap and be rocked but every now and then I end up holding her while I sit in that chair and I see my sister. When she died everyone said I was going to be a great father one day and I hope they were right. I own my own business but that experience has made sure that time with my family is always a top priority. I'd move Heaven and earth, if I could, to bring her back.

When I hear that song, II have a hard time deciding whether to turn it off or turn it up.

Once I started seeing evidence build up that made sense, I realized that this earth couldn't be as old as its taught, it should be a lot younger.

The evidence kept stacking up for it and I realized that there is a book that teaches all of the events that the evidence I discovered supports.

"I have a good one I recently started making.  Take a microwavable container (plastic takeaway boxes are great).

Add:

* Sliced raw veg (Carrots, onions, broccoli, mange tout, french beans, cabbage, pak choi, spring onions, bell peppers, chilli peppers, bean sprouts etc).  Anything you have to hand really.
* Cooked chicken.
* Ready-to-wok noodles (fresh udon noodles would be good too).
* A tablespoon or so of Chinese style sauce.  e.g. Hoisin, plum, sweet and sour etc.

At work microwave for 3 minutes.  Result is tasty noodles and fresh crunchy veg.  A bit like chow mein, but not fried.

For example: best friends vs acquaintances. If she's talking to her Best friend it's probably her normal conversation voice. It's it's and acquaintance we fake the high voice to act like we like their company. It's tough but true. It's the same with work.

However, her happy life is shattered when she is attacked by a Chiropteran, a hematophagous bat-like creature that lives by feeding on human blood. Saya learns that she is the only one who can defeat them, as her blood causes their bodies to crystallize and shatter. Armed with her special katana, Saya embarks on a journey with her family, allies, and her chevalier Haji, to rid the world of the Chiropteran threat and recover her identity. The course of the journey reveals the background history of the Chiropterans and Saya's past, which extends into the mid-19th century.

"- If you are a man, you can never EVER make any comment about a student's clothing - especially a female student. If they're wearing something inappropriate, you better go find a female teacher to say something for you. If you say anything, you're looking at losing your job for sexual harassment. I've seen it happen. Just a simple, ""Jessica, that skirt is too short"" or ""Sarah, that shirt is inappropriate"" will do it. All that student needs to do is tell someone ""Mr. Smith was looking at my skirt - I think he's a pervert"" and you're gone. Even worse if that student has something against you. The school district will fire you because they don't want to get in the middle of a legal battle defending a possible pervert. Easier to just let you go and replace you with someone else. This is part of the reason that there are so many female teachers these days. People don't feel ""safe"" having a grown man around their teenage girl.

- Lots of ""mandatory opportunities"" - extra classes and inservice functions that you MUST go to. They're always organized and presented by people who have never set foot inside a classroom and have NO idea what you deal with on the job. They also use way too many acronyms, read you powerpoints, and for the most part, treat you like children. You won't learn a *damn* thing at one of these.

- States and cities get grants for technology in the classroom thinking ""if we throw computers at the kids, they'll get better test scores."" Most of these grants include both a stick and a carrot: the carrot is more technology (computers, smartboards, etc.) the stick is that you now have another mandatory graduation test that you have to teach instead of the actual subject material that the kids NEED to learn. Then you get the technology in your classroom and nobody tells you how to use it. Or sometimes they'll only put it in half the classrooms. Or worse, they'll put just two computers in a classroom for 30 kids. What do 30 students do with TWO computers? You either need a lab of computers or no computers.",234

It was tragic, and no-one should have to die that young.

At the time I remember mostly feeling disgust at how everyone was tripping over themselves to portray him like a saint, when the truth is he was a bully and a dick to pretty much everyone. I still felt bad for his family though, they were obviously crushed. They ended up creating a scholarship in his name that I think is still around.",1

Not the OP but I had a similar experience after my dad died when I was 14. I settled into being an atheist after being raised Catholic. I found no peace in the afterlife for my dad. I've come to realize that my actions while I am alive matter most of all. I'm over 10 years out from my dad's death and I see how I think about him daily still. The way he raised me lives on in how I view certain things. It is pretty cool that way. I've come to terms with dying one day. I feel really peaceful knowing that my time alive will affect people long after I'm gone. ,1

"I worked at Chipotle for a year and I know exactly what you mean. The only person who I didn't hate for ordering a kid's meal was a nice older lady who wouldn't try to fuck around with the amount of food that's supposed to be included. Also if you're working on the line and someone orders a kid's meal quesadilla to-go during peak hours, then have fun taking 3 times the amount you should for an order while you slide the tortilla up and down the line and try to make sure someone's fumbling to fill those annoying little cups with rice and beans. Man kid's meals pissed me off. Also the added step of having to grab 2 juice boxes and a milk carton out of the fridge didn't help earlier. I worked on Cash and on the line sometimes so I was able to experience pretty much all angles of why the kids meal is just hella annoying. There's a reason Kid's Meal doesn't appear on the menu. As my manager put it, ""we make gourmet burritos, we're not a kid's restaurant. We make kids meals if they order them but we're not gonna advertise it.""",10

I""m not sure I understand your second question. If you're asking whether it's impossible to get your kids back, then the answer is no. But it's a difficult and time consuming process. And it has to be done quickly. There's an inherent tension in the system. The state depriving a person of their parental rights is second -- in my mind -- only to depriving them of their freedom. But we don't want to leave kids in limbo while their parents struggle to get themselves together.  ",3

If you have an eating disorder and you're in recovery, then things like numbers (relating to number of calories, weight, or measurements), dieting, and overeating can ""trigger"" the desire to relapse into old behaviours.

That doesn't mean that I think we should censor food intake. I can understand the use of ""trigger warnings"" on websites that have a large population of people with eating disorders, but elsewhere, it's not realistic. We can't list everyone's triggers when there are hundreds of thousands of them. It's much better to learn how to deal with triggers when you're confronted with them.

"&gt;  In today's current climate, in America at least, being Jewish is very close to being considered white.

Very close? Perhaps, but still not white. While Jews and whites can certainly identify with each other easier than say, whites and blacks, there is still a big enough difference to keep us and whites racially separate from each other. 

&gt; until you fix discrimination black people will always have it worse, no matter where the bar is set

You're correct, however the issue is then which should we solve first, police brutality or discrimination? I feel that taking on police brutality as a whole first would be most efficient as it's a more legal issue. We can train police to restrain force a lot easier than we can train them to not discriminate. 

Once the bar has been raised across the board, then we can bring blacks and other minorities up as well by challenging discrimination which is more of a social issue than a legal one 

&gt;  Again, this isn't about police brutality as a wider issue, this is about police discrimination which manifests itself as police brutality. If we want to start a movement against brutality in general, that's totally cool. But it isn't accomplishing the same goals as black lives matter.

That's a fair enough reason. I don't think you're wrong, but I just feel that discrimination is a much more difficult, complex, nuanced and controversial problem to tackle than plain old police brutality. 

Revising and setting more clear rules in which police can use force will reduce brutality cases overall. Then it can be easier to pinpoint which are clearly discrimination cases as circumstances are now more specific. ",1

"Ah ok, I see what you're saying. In the UK if you call for violence against either a specific person or a group of people you can be charged with incitement. I think it's also possible to prosecute someone for racial abuse.

In France, a ['comedian'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieudonn%C3%A9_M'bala_M'bala) (I use the word in inverted commas as I find him incredibly unfunny) gets quite regularly fined for incitement, as his shows are seen (rightly) as anti-Semitic.

Personally, I see advantages and disadvantages in the First Amendment, partly due to the fact that censoring someone like Dieudonne or Katie Hopkins (the UK equivalent of Ann Coulter) is completely counterproductive and gives them this kind of martyr complex of being lone crusaders against the totalitarian PC establishment. But I understand why we have those laws too. Another thing that's done in the UK is that TV news (but not print newspapers) has objectivity laws, which means that a channel cannot be seen to be overtly biased towards a certain ideology, and cannot make incorrect statements without later correcting them. This means that our TV news is still relatively respectable compared to the US (although the BBC has really deteriorated in the past couple of years) and something like Fox News would never be allowed to exist.",2

Eg: Bob says niggers are good for  nothing and should all be killed.

It's mostly the violence I'm not liking here.  
However, if Bob says 'I don't like black people because they're black'  then to get rid of him for wherever would be the wrong thing to do. Bob isn't his view on black people any more than I am my own view of black people.   
Besides, those who discriminate should be embraced to be show the error of their ways rather than shunned. If they have more exceptions to their rules, they'll stop believing in those rules.  ",1

"What makes you feel like the gender you identify as? It's just inside. You don't look at your genitals and feel like it validates your gender. There are people who've known since they were far too young to understand the concept of gender that they're male/female. People who assumed that they'd grow their penis at a later stage, or that their penis would fall off as they grow older, etc. Not because they're told it will, but because they can feel that what they currently have isn't normal to them.

The reason most of us don't give an answer is because it's a very complex thing. Even experts don't really have a conclusive answer. They have theories on what makes someone transgender, but not absolute evidence yet.

It's not the same as 'feeling' like a different race, because you can never be another race. Whereas hormones, the way your brain is wired, etc., can make you feel male or feel female.

And we don't need to validate it. If you don't want to believe the countless people, countless children, who say those things, then that's cool, but that doesn't mean everyone is lying because they can't present proof of it.",8

"&gt;Those of us who are part of a majority culture (I'm white in the U.S.) forget sometimes that culture is in perpetual flux and the culture we have now is not the culture we used to have or the culture we will have. If it changes because a certain group of people have reached critical mass or because of a change in technology we do ourselves and our fellow country dwellers no service trying in vain to hold on to what we have that is inevitably going to change, is changing.

Cultural change is not necessarily negative. However, there are certain moral values which many people in the West, even liberals, would defend as objectively good. These are values like free speech, tolerance for different religions, women's rights, rule of law, and so on. The potential issue is that for many non-Western cultures, especially Islamic culture, these values are irrelevant or even antithetical to their core values. Look at Saudi Arabia, an example of a country with a predominantly Islamic-Arabic culture. If Sweden or any other western country became more like Saudi Arabia, do you think it would be a better or worse place for women and religious minorities? 

Religious tolerance in the West is not perfect, but the facts are that in many Western countries Muslims are allowed to freely build mosques, community centers, and worship freely. In Saudi Arabia you are not allowed to build even a single church. Conversion to non-Islamic religions is not allowed. In Malaysia, Christians are banned from using the word ""Allah"" although they have used that word for centuries to refer to God. It's difficult to find even a single Christian-majority country in the world that treats Islam in that way.

In short, cultural change is not always good or even neutral. Cultural change can be really bad for those of us with certain norms and moral values that are incompatible with the newer culture. ",9

For every new couple (and episode) he dressed *slightly* differently, as he was trying to appear more like his clients in a way. For this older, more proper middle-class couple, he wore a suit with a nice shirt and tie. For this younger couple, a more casual shirt with jeans and no tie, and with this farmer couple, he wore a nice sweater and rubber boots, kinda looking like an 'upscale' traditional british farmer.


It's probably a no-brainer for people who work with those kinds of things already, but for me it was kind of fun to look at (which only made me think of how many clothes and outfits he would have to use throughout the year, and how many he currently had tucked away in the trunk of his car), but it also made sense too: If I were to buy a house, I'd trust the guy more (if not obviously, then subconsciously) if he looked fairly relaxed like me, instead of generally looking like a slick stiff in a suit.

It wasn't that deep close to the shore but there was still a significant slope towards deeper water and the ground in the lake is made of mud so it's not easy for a small child to get back on his feet in that situation.

So basically I was drowning and my parents and uncle were busy cutting down trees with a chainsaw and so didn't hear anything, but my brother who is only a few years older than me used what was probably all his strength to keep my head above water while his unusually strong voice somehow managed to pierce through the roaring sound of a chainsaw to alert my parents of what was going on.

I found out recently that my license was suspended, luckily I haven't been driving anyway, but I don't know if I have a warrant out or what.

I'm a random fact machine. The amount of stupid facts I know is ridiculous. Too bad you have to deal with my lack of common sense and the fact that I don't pick up a single hint about anything. ,3

"I think really it's just people who are tired of /r/niceguys style nice guys, and since ""friend zone"" is a common excuse in that group, they start thinking of the ""friend zone"" as the Nice Guy version only, and ignoring how it actually works.

Yea, the whole ""I'm just going to be your friend in hopes you come around someday to bang"" thing definitely happens, but the people denying the friend zone act like it's impossible to have unrequited love and remain friends. I've been on both sides of it, it's not.",0

"This is probably the most accurate response. The other things seem crazy, but are clinically proven to work well over any other known treatment.

"Well I'm not religious or any thing but I went to a Catholic highschool and in our assemblies, our headmaster would often tell us parables(?) or stories or other little moral tales from the bible, some of which I can still remember today.

My favourite story is about how, in some building in some town where residents needed to donate to the poor, the richest gave gifts out of their wealth to the poor. However, there was an old woman who gave all she could spare in the form of one penny.

I may not be religious, but I think there are definitely some good moral teachings in the bible, although you do need to cherry pick them.",1
