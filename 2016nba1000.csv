&gt; Cavaliers coach David Blatt is dealing with those same type of reports. He’s even getting near-identical quotes from LeBron about the star’s support.

"Upon the immediate breaking news, my initial reaction was a loss of respect for LeBron, who I (still) believe orchestrated the move to get his own guys in place. I'm a huge LeBron fan and have always thought he gets too much grief from mainstream media and fans.

After reading Haywood's comments, who I believe would tell the honest truth with no skin in the game, I think the Blatt firing was the right move. If Blatt really failed to call out LeBron on mistakes, missed assignments/rotations, and mental lapses during games, then he needed to go. A coach can't fear one of his players and be unwilling to point out when there are ways that the player, no matter how great, could help make the team better.

Did Blatt draw a short straw? Definitely. I think the proper move by the Cavs front office was to release Blatt during the off-season. Waiting until this point only leads to more speculation, confusion, and distraction at a time when the team should be 100% focused on improvement and understanding their best way to win a title.

I'm very interested to see how the rest of the season plays out with the Cavs - specifically, I want to see if there are any glaring changes in their schemes, rotations, etc that would be directly attributable to the shake-up at head coach (for better or worse).",183

A coach can't fear one of his players and be unwilling to point out when there are ways that the player, no matter how great, could help make the team better.

This goes both ways. It's likely that Blatt didn't feel like he could call out Lebron because, well, he probably couldn't. Lebron has his people *all over* the organization. It was abundantly clear from day 1 that Lebron held more sway in the organization than Blatt. That is just a blatantly unhealthy dynamic.  You *could* say the same thing about Kobe, Dirk, Duncan in their respective franchises, but for those players that has actually rarely been the case. None of those players filled the bench, management and roster with their friends or gave postgame assessments of the head coach. And the reason Spo could coach Lebron more successfully was that this simply wasn't the case in Miami. For better or worse, Lebron has hijacked the Cavs franchise. Yesterday was a dark day for that very franchise, so the buck has to stop with him. 

I think it's telling that he wants a coach like Mark Jackson (I haven't seen much of Lue so I can't say). Someone who will be stern with him but is essentially part of his posse within the organization. That might end up being the best scenario for a Lebron-led team in the future.

"""MJ confirmed as new Head Coach of the Spurs, as Gregg ""Blatt"" Popovich is sacked after a 38-7 start.""",143
"This one was a real head-scratcher at the time.

In 1994-1995, Bob Hill took a job as a head coach, leading the San Antonio Spurs to a franchise-best 62 games in a season, reaching the conference finals, falling to the future champion Houston Rockets. The next season, he led the team to 59 wins and the playoffs. In the 1996-1997 season, the Spurs started 3-15, largely in part due to losing David Robinson and Sean Elliot to early-season injuries. Bob Hill, a coach coming off of 62- &amp; 59-win seasons, was fired after only 18 games, and was replaced by the team's general manager, *the same guy who chose to fire him.* As expected, this coach didn't do too much better, finishing the season with a 20-62 record. Spurs fans weren't pleased at all with the coaching change, but after 5 championship wins, I'd say San Antonio fans have probably forgiven 3-time Coach of the Year **Gregg Popovich** for his actions.",117
You're projecting,265
Let's just sign a guy that has never coached a team in his life to a multi-year deal on a team with championship aspirations. You can't make this shit up.,239

No way the Rockets could keep up that strategy the whole quarter or they would have been screwed in the fourth quarter.

"From /u/diskopo:

You want it in chronological order? I don't have the full list (there's just way too much stuff to remember off the top of my head), but here goes.

- Staged a coup of John Stockton while he was on the Jazz, causing Stockton to retire.
- Cheated on his wife with a stripper, then getting blackmailed by the prostitute + some other guy, while at the same time being a born-again pastor
- Bristled at Mike Malone being the assistant coach under him (ownership wanted him to be the Associate Head Coach, like Gentry was with Kerr, but when Jackson found out he said NO WAY
- Didn't let assistant coaches do interviews with press because he thought they were gunning for his job
- Pushed Malone out because Jackson thought Malone was gunning for his job
- Ran ISO-ball all the time
- Instilled a ""us vs them"" where the ""them"" was the entire front office. He would tell the players that the front office didn't want them to win so that Mark Jackson would look bad. C'mon that's lunacy
- Barred Jerry West and Jim Barnett (the beloved TV color guy) along with everyone else from practices so they couldn't hear the crazy shit he said to the team
- Told the team Ezeli was rooting for them to lose so that Ezeli would look better (he was injured). This culminated in Ezeli in tears saying that there was no way he would do this, when confronted by the team
- Told the team that Harrison Barnes was possessed by a demon, which is why he regressed
- Darren Erman, the assistant responsible for the defense after Mike Malone left, was recording Mark Jackson surreptitiously to try and capture the crazy shit like the Harrison Barnes demon thing and the Ezeli thing, but was caught and fired 
- Noted homophobe, including the ""I'll pray for him"" when discussing Jason Collins coming out. This doesn't fly in the bay area when a lot of the team staff is gay and so is the front office, including the COO/President Rick Welts
- Didn't want to hire actual good assistants, instead, he hired yes-men like Pete Myers and Lindsay Hunter, who backstabbed Alvin Gentry in Phoenix to get the head job
- All the coaching staff were allying themselves with star players instead of the players who actually needed their help/development, so a lot players like Barnes didn't get the development time and help they needed
- He put players against each other, telling a star player ""hey that bench thinks he's better than you"" and then telling the bench guy ""hey that star guy thinks you're shit, go take his job""
- Didn't get along with anyone in the front office, including Jerry West, Bob Myers, and actually the rest of the employees (marketing, PR, etc)
- No preparation. He said in the Clippers series that he didn't need to prepare extra hours, when Doc Rivers was up all night devising schemes

Not to mention that he was just a really horrible coach. I'm sure I left out a lot of stuff.

Edit: I see you guys asking for a source on the Barnes Demon thing. One source is a message board post where a guy said he talked to Darren Erman in a bar, and Erman told him the story. The second (the one I personally believe) source is a Warriors reporter telling me this personally. I can't give you guys proof of this since he told it to me, so you'll have to take it w/ a grain of salt. I don't expect you guys to trust some random guy's word online, so make of it what you will. But to me that's 2 sources (one personal, which makes it more believable to me).

I forgot some more post-coaching shitty things he did:

- Saying rim protectors are obsolete, which threw shade on Bogut, and then saying Deandre Jordan was the DPOY (over Draymond) because of his rim protection
- Wanting to take credit for Kerr's success talking about caterpillars and butterflies
- Saying Curry was not the MVP, which is fair, but not what you expect someone to say when Curry went to bat to keep Jackson's job. Maybe thought Curry didn't try hard enough, which is bullshit since Curry tried very hard and stumped for Jackson personally
- Saying Curry was ruining the game 

Anything /u/diskopo missed and some other discussion should be in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/warriors/comments/42b5ne/what_exactly_is_mark_jackson_accused_suspected_of/)
Even though he did some good things for us, he's a real POS, even if it doesn't seem so from the outside.

EDIT: Oh, and some insight from /u/Zlasher that is weird as fuck if you think it's true:

He was literally forming a cult in the locker room. You won't see this documented as evidence of his firing but every interview it was ""MY lockerroom"" these are ""MY guys"" ""MY players"" they stand by ME only. Everything was centered around him so that when he WAS finally fired, it was more stockholm syndrome than anything else, that had players like Curry and Klay and Draymond and Iguodala being against the firing.
Then once they got Kerr they realized they saw the light and you never heard those players talk about Mark Jackson again. Literally, in Curry's MVP speech, you didn't hear about it.",146

*I am a pretty frequent StubHub user, as I often use it to buy tickets to Toronto Raptors games. I have recommended the site to friends, and have never had an issue with it before. Today, I am writing to express my disappointment with StubHub. This story appeared on the website TheLeadSports.com, and was highly upvoted on the NBA subreddit:*

*http://www.theleadsports.com/the-surreal-story-of-stubhub-screwing-over-a-kobe-fan/*

*The story details how StubHub reversed a ticket order for a game that will literally be one-of-a-kind. It shows terrible corporate practice, poor judgement on behalf of StubHub, and some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. StubHub has ruined a fan's chance to see their favourite player play his final game. I wanted to let you know that I will be seeking ticket-buying options outside of StubHub from now on. I had been meaning to check out the SeatGeek app, and this is finally an excuse to do so.*

"Here is a story about the saddest chic-fil-a I have ever eaten.

A few years ago, back when I was playing college lacrosse... We were ranked #1 in the country, already seeded first for the NCAA tournament. We were coming up against our biggest rival, one we literally never, *ever*, beat- and their campus was only a mile away. Final game of the regular season. 

They always got the best recruits, had the best gear, had nationwide recognition. We were written off by analysts despite being undefeated the entire season.

Then came gametime. We were down by some outrageous number of goals in the fourth quarter. Maybe 8? But we were at home, and a sell-out crowd of probably 7k+ at a lacrosse game was something we'd never experienced. We rallied back, and tied the game at the buzzer to go to overtime. A perfect season still in tact.

One overtime went by scoreless, and with less than a second remaining in the second extra period, our rivals scored off a deflected pass. Crushing all of us and the hope of a miracle comeback.

We trudged into our lockerroom in silence- heads down. We knew the season was by no means over, but a loss like that stung. That mojo- the magic we were carrying with us all season wasn't as strong as we'd thought.

As we arrived in the lockerroom and got ourselves together, we noticed an enormous box sitting in the center of the room. Sheepishly, a captain opened it. Our sponsor- Chic-fil-a, had left an insulated box full of hundreds of fresh chicken sandwiches.

We each took as many as we could carry and housed them, silently through sorrowful bites in our lockers.

It was the strangest mix of emotions I've ever experienced.

I'm sorry you couldn't get your chicken little fella.

It would have helped I promise.",127

"Be patient, you aren't going to be able to draft a franchise player because you mortgaged your future.  Maybe you can get luck with Boston's first round pick in 2017, but that's not likely.

The good news: a lot of money is coming your way despite your mistakes, the cap is rising, free agents will be available.  But you can't attract the best free agents, they won't want to come to Brooklyn.  You can give it a shot, but don't count on it.  

So you want to go for undervalued free agents.  That means hiring a bunch of scouts and advanced stats guys to analyze every single player available, [like Detroit has been doing](http://www.si.com/nba/2015/10/29/detroit-pistons-stan-van-gundy-reggie-jackson-andre-drummond-film-tape).  Go for young, undervalued players.  Do the same with a d-league team.  Go for volume rather than sure things and hope you strike gold -- sometimes a second round player or undrafted player or player another team didn't want turns into a star, but since it's a crap shoot you need to go through 30 players a year to see if you can find gold.  

Do that for the next three years and see if you can develop a nice young team with a promising future, maybe even a couple of stars.  Then you will be back to drafting in the first round and you will have a team worthy of top free agents and you will have a front office ready to build a contender.

Meanwhile, you are going to have to work overtime to make it up to your season ticket holders.  Drop prices, improve the food, improve the customer service, invest in your customers.  Show them your plan, improve transparency (to a reasonable extent) so they develop trust.  Make it worth their while to stick with the team.",249

"I can't believe people haven't caught on to why Love is struggling.

LeBron is a middle 1/3rd player. Kyrie is a middle 1/3rd player. Love is a middle 1/3 player who they shove into the corner and expect him to produce like he was if he was playing in the middle 1/3rd.

It's time for either Kyrie or LeBron to go off ball and play from the wing. It's not the ideal, but with their ball-handling ability, it will be a lot easier for them to adjust to scoring from the wing than Love.

I have no idea what Cleveland was thinking when they thought pairing these three together without tweaking anything before making a massive change would work. Wade has always been a strong, versatile player who attacks well from the wing and Bosh was much more of [a baseline player](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/boshch01/shooting/2010/) than Love ever was, but also versatile enough to be affective from around the floor.

Blatt's offense has always been simplistic, and Kyrie's and LeBron's lack of versatility when it comes to they way they play the game (because they've always been too good to be told to change stuff up) is choking out the all-important third option. All three of them are horse-drawn carriages, and they're wondering why they can't keep up with the Warrior's automobile.

This is so stupid. People blindly blaming Love must have no basketball sense to not understand why a wheel with threes hubs and only two spokes between them isn't working. This is an institutional failing, and LeBron, Kyrie, and Blatt are just as much to blame as Love.",109

**EDIT:** Ok no bullshit/funny opinion time... I, as I'm sure all Cavs fans, have been completely blind sided by this. But watching the Cavs this year they are definitely flat. As much as I like Love he still seems like the odd man out and to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if he gets traded in some kind of package deal. It's really too bad because I like Blatt a lot. He seems like he's a damned good coach and an equally good person. I know he will find success moving forward. This has ""team chemistry"" written all over it though.

**DOUBLE EDIT:** Chances are Moz doesn't stay after this. That's just my opinion though.


**3x EDIT:** @FearTheSword  40s40 seconds ago - So your upside here, it would appear, it that this is David Griffin's move, since Blatt was Dan's guy. Not like previous LOLCOACHING moves.

**4x EDIT:** [This is cold...](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CZWlFZwU8AATsrA.jpg:large)

**5x EDIT:** ‏@bruce_arthur - Kevin Love tried to defend Blatt, but the firing came in the form of a pick and roll

**6x EDIT:** Adrian ‏@WojVerticalNBA - Since last season, LeBron James and his agent Rich Paul have been strong advocates of Lue becoming head coach, league sources tell Yahoo.

**7x EDIT:** [Jason Lloyd ‏@JasonLloydABJ 8 minutes ago - I know LeBron's name will get thrown around a lot in this, but the issues with Blatt went much, much deeper than LeBron James.](https://vine.co/v/iOlBIBPuPdw)

**Last Edit:** Jason Lloyd ‏@JasonLloydABJ 3 minutes ago - Was told repeatedly, ""as long as we're winning, there's no story."" Guys tolerated Blatt when #Cavs won, blamed him when they lost.

It would be entirely too easy to word it another way and make the Blazers management look like complete morons, while making the players/fanbase the victims. Something like:

""CJ McCollum will be unable to play in tonight's game because the Blazer's Assistant Coach mistook him for Montero when filling out the active player's list""

Other teams haven't been able to avoid/resist roster turnover; 13 of 15 Western Conference teams don't even have the same head coach that they did *three* years ago.

This might be post hoc explaining, but the Warriors are able to do it so quickly by having two of the best floor spacers in history, a DPoY-level big who is as mobile as they come with a decent outside shot, and one of the best passing PF-C combinations I can remember.

Tim (Duncan) is older, and we need a guy to command a double team down there.’ So I was like, **‘Maybe I’m not a Spur, because I’ve been averaging 23 (points per game) for the last three to four years, and maybe I don’t fit into y’all’s system of let’s all average 17 (points per game).’** And he was like, ‘No, we’re not trying to change who you are and make you average 16 or 17. We want you to be you, because you’re going to help us be better and vice versa.’ He kind of reaffirmed that they didn’t want to change me, and that who I am is ok.”

My mom thought she would be giving StubHub a reasonable 10% fee for brokering the sale ($99 minus $89.10 is $9.90, which is 10%). Meanwhile, buyers probably thought the $22.08 difference between $121.08 and $99 was the only fee Stubhub was collected.

But, no, they make their fee on each side! That's pretty insane. Brokers in other industries typically mark up one side, so that there's some transparency - the buyer pays the total, the seller receives that amount minus the broker fee. Stubhub's system has a misleading third number in between, so that each of the other numbers seem fairer.

Edit: For the record, charging the buyer $121.08 and giving the seller $89.10 means StubHub charged a 35.9% fee for the transaction.

It's just like the time he told his son he could have that sleepover he had been begging to have for months. The big party.

And his wife got off work and came home to a dozen kids turning on the playstation at 8PM with soda and snacks and movies lined up for the night and that hard working, intelligent woman gave her husband, the shit Ref, a look that terminated any hopes he had about saving his marriage. Even at home, he couldn't make the right decision.  Now he had to tell his son that not only were all of his friends going home, but he had to go fucking study for the test. He was just trying to make them happy and they hated him for it.

"English was an underrated player, but his scoring must be appreciated in context.  From 1981-1990 Doug Moe was the head coach of the Nuggets and implemented a high-paced, run-and-gun motion offense.  Defense was not a priority.  This offense worked best during the regular season in Denver's high altitude when visiting teams played elsewhere the night before, but was less effective in the playoffs, when teams rested between games.

The Nuggets set records for offense.  During one stretch, including the 1981-82 season, they scored at least 100 points in 136 consecutive games.  During the 1981–82 season they scored at least 100 points in every game and set a record per game *average* of 126.5 points.  On December 13, 1983, the Detroit Pistons beat the Nuggets in triple overtime, 186–184, setting an NBA record for combined points, 370.

Alex English's teammate Fat Lever was also underrated, he had 42 triple doubles, behind only Magic Johnson and Jason Kidd in the *post-merger* record books.  He had a *lot* more games with double-figure scoring, 8+ rebounds, and 8+ assists -- he *averaged* that much from 1986-89.  But Lever's stats, like English's, have been discounted by the fact that they played in a high-paced offense and did not have much success in the playoffs.

"I think everyone getting upset or confused about the ejection needs to take a look at Smith's career.

The guy has shown time and again that he is willing to risk seriously injuring opponents with cheap shots if he loses his temper and/or feels they deserve it.  

The spinning back fist on Crowder is one example, but the elbow he threw at Sefoloshoa might have been even worse if he'd managed to connect.

Point being that if you got a guy that has shown a willingness to risk seriously injuring opponents if he is in a bad mood, you need to get him the fuck out of the game the second it even appears that he is approaching the line.  

I guess I'm just not sure what the alternative is.  I mean, say they call a flagrant 1 and 5 minutes later he decides to crush Curry or Klay or someone in the temple with an elbow and put them out of action for a couple weeks. 

If Smith is cool trying to injure people, as he has shown over his career, and the Cavs are cool with him being part of their roster, *they* should be the ones that suffer if he does shit that shows he might be about to snap.  

It is insane to ask opponents to go out there and risk getting cold-clocked in the face, knocked out, and get their knee torn up just because Smith and the Cavs want to roll that way.",127

Edit: I guess I have to say this because people keep replying. I know how math works. I just extrapolated from the current win record to the rest of the season. Of course I shouldn't do this because the Warriors cannot realistically keep up with this winning pace (injuries, resting starters, tougher schedule, etc.),  but this is such a joke stat that it's not really worth doing any serious calculation. The point is you should not put any money whatsoever on this. And for those of you saying the whole team could get die in a plane or bus crash, yes that's a possibility that has a low but statistically significant chance because we're dealing with unlikely events here, but if this actually happens I don't think the Warriors would be playing any more games this season, and so they could not possibly lose any. Even if the starters all get injured or something, we're still taking about *losing every single remaining game*. Maybe it's not as unlikely as winning powerball 4 times in a row,  but I suspect the actual probability to be around winning it 3 times in a row. ",258

• Blatt didn't hold everyone accountable when reviewing game tape. Brendan said he couldn't bring himself to correct Lebron, while Lue did in fact tell Lebron where he was at fault. 

• Lue was in charge of defense, never Blatt, so not much is going to change there.

Pat Riley probably doesn't leave New York in 1995. While he probably leaves eventually (assuming Dolan still Dolans), is the opportunity for him to go to Miami still available?

"&gt;Be careful with comparing Steph with Messi... you will get massive down votes.

Man, it's just not that good of a good comparison. (I didn't down vote him).

In soccer, individual players do not usually decide outcomes of matches, at least not to the extent that they do in basketball. Messi does and he's won 5 Ballon D'Ors for that very reason. He's looked like a ball kicking wildebeest since the age of 18. Sure, he's gotten better as he's aged but he was already shoving shit down his rivals' assholes at the age of 19 when he scored a hat trick against Real Madrid. Steph Curry has been playing at Messi's level for about....a year. 

Don't get me wrong, I totally understand the comparison. But let's wait a couple of more years before we can compare him to someone who people considered the greatest player of all time in his respective sport at the age of 28. 

Also, can you tell me with a straight face that there's that big of a margin between him and other top players in this league such as LBJ or KD? Ronaldo has been very close to Messi in stats but there's a pretty big drop off from those two. And even in the comparison of Ronaldo and Messi, we can say that Ronaldo has equally impressive stats but the eye test just falls to Messi, and by a somewhat sizable distance imo.

Maybe I'm just a fanboy but Messi produces Wilt Chamberlain level absurdity on the field.",117

"&gt; What’s so ironic is that — as late as the third quarter — we were genuinely thinking to ourselves that we’d executed a really good plan. That’s something a lot of people tend to forget about that night: that we were winning — pretty comfortably, and pretty deep into the game. Kobe had 26 at halftime … and we were up by 14. This is great, we were thinking. You never want to give up 50, of course. But if that’s what it was going to take to beat this particular team on this particular night, then 50 was fine by us.

This is something that a lot of people gloss over. The Raptors were winning that game and were up coming into the third. Kobe said ""fuck it, I'm taking over"" and did exactly that.

I know people make a big deal out of Steph's scoring prowess now, and rightfully so, but watching 2006 and 2007 Kobe was a privilege - he was easily one of most complete offensive basketball players in NBA history. 3 pointers, post ups, mid range jumpers, everything. This was the guy who scored 60+ *twice* in a span of 5 games or so (in March 2007) while being the #1 target of every opposing team. People speak of KD and Steph as being these otherworldly scorers, but the scoring totals by Kobe in those two years aren't going to be matched for a long time.

David Robinson:

&gt; ""Do I agree with the decision? No. But coaches are the first persons to be looked at when things go bad. And 3-15 is bad. I don't think Bob was losing the team. I thought the guys were working pretty hard.''

Dennis Rodman: (traded from Spurs to Bulls previous season)

&gt; ""I always said that without me they wouldn't have anything. Not that I'm a god or Jesus, but the heart of the team left. I thought I was the backbone of the team. I put up a fight and helped them stand on their own feet. Now they don't have anyone out there to take a shot for the team.''

Sports Writer Alan Greenburg: (Hartford Courant)

Even now when he's asked to do far more offensively than he ever was in those four seasons with LeBron, I can re-call a clutch defensive stop late vs Denver when the game was insanely close which was solely due to how amazing he closed out on a shooter.

Give Wade the multi-year deal he wanted but for less money (Sub 15 mil), Sign Whiteside to a near or full max ~19 mil. Drop Deng's cap hold and don't resign him unless he's coming back for super cheap, and use the remaining money to give out another max to a big name FA.

"I think he is generally showing that he doesn't have the right idea of the value of the rest of a team's organization.  It feels like he may not have fully appreciated how much of Miami's success was dependent upon people other than him.  He was the greatest player in the world, but also had the benefit of a serious, smart, and stable leader in Pat Riley, a quality coach in Spoelstra, and committed and intelligent true professionals with Wade and Bosh.  I'm not sure he realized when he picked up and left for Cleveland that those things *really matter* for building a winning team.  A real contender needs to be the sum of many parts working together; Cleveland right now is an outstanding collection of talent on paper, but I don't think LeBron has allowed the management, coaching, and other teammates around him to develop into the roles they need to fill to hit the next level.  

He's gotta figure out that he alone isn't enough to win a championship and let this organization develop into a functional ecosystem with stability and clear roles.  ",108

Start of second and fourth LeBron rests and its Irving and Love running pick and roll a la the Wade and Bosh lineups in Miami.

End of first and third LeBron with all shooters in the run and gun he was accustomed to in Miami.

End of the game is a case-by-case basis with consideration to running Lebron at C and Love at PF.

This lets them split up Love and LeBron's floor time the way they did with Wade and LeBron.  And hopefully during that time Love reasserts himself as the number one guy and he and Kyrie get some pick and roll chemistry.

"Before Curry started to blow up last season and even after he became the MVP-caliber player that he is now, I've always thought that Kyrie had the better handle.

Curry needs less space to get his shot off, but if you look at the actual amount of space that they can create with their dribbles, it seems to me like Kyrie's usually better at that, or blowing past his defender or splitting defenders. Even the highlight that this thread is about - you won't really see Curry doing that often. Kyrie just looks smoother and quicker when he's dribbling. To me, there's something about Curry's game that kind of looks ""awkward"" even though the results are great (even his shooting, he's the best shooter of all time but his form is pretty unconventional and his landings usually look awkward, etc.) Kyrie's moves just look more polished, I'm not really sure how to describe it.

"Kobes 81 is the greatest scoring output of all time


&gt;Well, in terms of points per minute, it's not. That's 1.909 and Kobe had 1.928 in his 81 point game and Wilt had 2.083 in his 100 point game. Let's adjust for pace now. In 61-62, teams put up 107.73 shots per game. In 77-78, teams put up 92.86 shots per game. And in 05-06, teams put up 78.98 shots per game. So now, if we set those point per minute numbers to the same season's pace, say 61-62, then Wilt would still be at 2.083, Gervin would be at 2.214, and Kobe would be at 2.629. Now, Kobe obviously was the only one that played with a 3 point line and he made 7 that game, so let's just turn those 3s into 2s which puts him at 74 points instead of 81. Kobe still ends up with 2.401. So your leaders in pace adjusted points per minute are:
Kobe: 2.401
Gervin: 2.214
Wilt: 2.083

&gt;Also note that Jordan's career high of 69 points came while playing 50 minutes, which is 1.706 pace adjusted. The closest player to Kobe, besides Kobe who also had 2.397 a month earlier, is Karl Malone with 2.285 in 89-90.

He went to the next clip and it was Mo Williams not getting back and Mike was saying, “Yo, Mo, we can’t have that. You’ve got to hustle a little more.” So Delonte West is sitting there and he’s seen enough and he stands up and says, “Hold up, now. You can’t be pussyfooting around like that.

"People don't know how much of a pain in the ass he was to the Heat during Lebron's years here. He tried to make himself part of the organization rather than a representative of a player. Demanding he be allowed to travel with the team on the private jet and in the locker room at all times and in team meetings.

This was on a Saturday morning, they had played a home game the previous night and I remember Boris didn't put up a great performance. My wife asked me what was wrong, and all I could say was ""Dude had 6 turnovers last night and he's installing carpet this morning. And I can't find the fucking sandpaper."" ",546

&gt;What makes Monday’s Spurs-Warriors game historically unique is the sheer quality of each team’s dominant unit. Only four games in NBA history have ever seen an offense 8 points better than the league’s efficiency face a defense 8 points better than that same league standard, and all of those were between the Spurs and Mavericks during the 2003-04 season. This game will do those one better by pitting a plus-9 offense against a plus-9 defense, an NBA first.",121
