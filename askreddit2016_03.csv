Isshinryu is known for being up close and personal. You're not going to want to take somebody down to the ground in an armbar or throw a sweeping fancy kick to someone's head if you are threatened in a dark parking lot. However training to hit the knees, head, groin of your assailant is very practical and useful in the event of an attack.

No matter what form you train, there is a mental sense of accomplishment of having bettered yourself and the relief that you can know defend yourself if needed. This sounds like something you would greatly benefit from.

But yeah magic nerds are the best. Much nicer, and generally older, than most other nerd-fandoms.

If I were you, I would not get individual cards as gifts. Individual cards have fleeting value, plus a lot of the appeal is that cards are tradable, and I wouldn't want to trade something that was given as a gift. Instead, boxed product is better, or maybe just small utility things that players need, like boxes and bags for card storage. If you do want to give him a card, make it a ""permanent jewel"" in his collection. This would be something like a card that has the art altered in a neat way. Or a limited promotion card.

"&gt;And taking responsibility is key, being aware than everything in life was a result of your choices and actions is pretty key to understanding exactly where your problems are coming from.

Except that is not correct.  There are many things that happen in life that are outside of one's control, even when it comes to your own thoughts and feelings.  At best, we can only control our reaction to them.

And what the hell does ""Taking responsibility"" even mean?  I have never heard that phrase used in a positive context.  It usually means that someone should accept the shame and guilt associated with their current suffering, and accept the suffering itself as just.  And people who feel shame and blame themselves don't seek out help as they believe their deserve to suffer.

&gt;And nowhere did I suggest that people should not seek help

You may not realize it, but you did:  *""you made those decisions and pay the price.""*  There is a finality to that statement.  You must suffer the consequences, there is nothing else to be done.  This may not be what you said (or rather meant to say), but it is what people hear when it is told to them.

I think in theory the system now works if the potential college student is rational in deciding to go to college. Most states have 100% free college for students in the top 10% of grades and SAT scores or if youre in the top 20-30% you get around 50-85% of tuition waived. If you dont fall into one of those categories, or get into an ivy league level school where tuition is free for low income students, it really doesnt make sense at all for you to go to college unless your parents are bankrolling you. But since we are in a free country, you are free to go to college if you fall outside that but it probably isnt in your best economic interest to do so.

Came here to see if the guy whose life I saved made a post. Asshole did not.,1
"My A/C went out one summer and I was told I'd have to get a new unit and quoted $7,500. I was pretty broke at the time and living in Florida so it was hot af. It stayed that way for 2 years before I could fix it. I had one night stands get up in the middle of the night and apologize for leaving but it was just too hot and the couldn't do it. I learned to deal. I had a chick that I really liked make it through the night a couple times so I started freezing a 2 liter bottle of water and putting it front of the fan at night which blew directly onto the bed. This actually worked and I'm sure she appreciated the romantic gesture.

Anyway I also had a cat which I let go in and out as he pleased. He had a bite taken out of his ear and would come home with wounds he acquired from taking on the neighborhood dogs. He was declawed so he had to fight like a 30's style boxer and his smack was pretty powerful. I would leave a small window in the laundry room, which faced the front of my house, open and that was how he got in and out. One day I was out front on a hot July day and the 200 year old neighbor lady, who lived alone and whom I rarely saw and had only spoken to a couple times, mentioned that I shouldn't leave the front window open because it would let all of the cool air out and cost a fortune on my power bill. I informed her that I didn't have A/C, hadn't for years, and that, considering I hadn't eaten in a couple days, A/C was the least of my worries. That was about the extent of our conversation. 

Later that evening there was a knock on my door and I opened it to this nice old lady handing me a huge bowl of homemade chicken noodle soup and a $20 bill and saying, ""no one should have to go hungry."" My first instinct was to politely decline but it was obvious she was set on this act of kindness and who am I to deny her that? I really hadn't eaten in at least a couple days and before that was a steady diet of McDoubles whenever I could scrounge up enough to change to buy one or two so I devoured the soup after thanking her profusely and promising to repay her.

I bought a pack of cigarettes since I also, as a regular smoker, hadn't smoked in a couple days. And before that was a couple good sized butts from an ashcan outside of a gas station so I was pretty hardup. I felt bad buying smokes with her $20 but I figured she'd understand. 

I started working a few weeks later and upon receiving my first paycheck I brought her some fresh shrimp home from work and handed her a folded up $100 bill. I'm not sure if she was even aware that I was paying her back with interest because she was old and probably well off and didn't make any mention of it in the future but it felt good to do it. 

And that's probably one of the reasons why I'm sensible to Bernie's ideas of Socialism and so against the notion that people shouldn't recieve help and should pull themselves up by the bootsraps. In this example, helping me out actually made financial sense for her in the end, with her being repaid 5X her initial investment. I think helping people get to a better place is something we all should do regardless of finances but the return is a nice little bonus.

Anyway I forget what even prompted me to write this or what even OPs original comment was. Go figure.",1

"Our entire food system is immoral, in almost countless ways.  You are not excluded because you don't eat meat.

There are huge human and environmental components to the farming of vegetables and starches.  People are used as slaves and indentured servants and are otherwise exploited here in the US and all around the world to grow the commodity starches (corn, soy, wheat, potatoes) that vegetarians most commonly use as their main sources of protein.  They are also enslaved to hand-pick tomatoes, berries, etc.  These people are forced to poop in the fields, sleep in the dirt and live on as little as possible so consumers can have mono-cropped produce for as little money as possible.  Farmers in Peru can no longer afford to eat their ancient staple grain, quinoa, because Americans will pay so much more for it.  So they have to grow it, but it gets shipped with fossil fuels to another continent.

But the fact that they had a more quality education and I went to a shitty public school just shows that I worked just as hard if not harder than they did.

Or Wheeler-Feynman's theory...no, I just looked them up and Wheeler-Feynman's Wikipedia page doesn't mention Hawking, so maybe it was just the first one. I found this explanation online, ""This is where the intellectual challenge starts. The path integral theory asserts that a particle travelling from point A to point B takes all possible paths – including the straight line, routes through any slits, around the Moon and back etc. A particle-wave takes all these paths at once and “condenses” at one location in space only when it has been observed/detected.""

"Instead of LGBTQIA, you can use the ultra inclusive acronym QUILTBAG! (Queer, Undecided, Intersex, Lesbian, Transgender, Bisexual, Asexual, Gay)

EDIT : folks are asking for an ELI5 of these terms, I will do my best. 

**Q** : Queer is a blanket term for anything falling outside of heterosexual or cisgender identites. It's a catch-all for those who don't identify exactly as I,L,T,B,A or G. (More on these letters in a moment.) Q could also stand for Questioning, which is exactly what it sounds like. 

**U** : Undecided means similar to Questioning (which is why I like to include Queer over Questioning.) Sexual and gender identity for some isn't perfectly cut and dry. Sometimes it takes a little bit to figure out, sometimes it changes as we grow. These people deserve to be a part of the community as well. 

**I** : Intersex describes a variety of situations where the reproductive or sexual organs a person is born with doesn't fit easily into ""male"" or ""female"". For example, it's possible to be born with female genetalia but male inner organs. This also covers people with ""mosaic chromosomes""; that is, some cells being XX and others being XY. 

**L** : Lesbian refers to women who are romantically and/or sexually involved exclusively with other women. 

**T** : Transgender is when the gender you are born with does not match the body you are born with. Some trans folks get gender-confirmation surgery, some don't. Since gender is a spectrum rather than a binary, there is lots and lots of grey area to wiggle in, insofar as identity, presentation, and your physical body. 

**B** : Bisexuals are folks who are attracted to those who identify as men as well and those who identify as women. Pansexuals are similar but explicitly include those who fall in the previously mentioned spectrum. 

**A** : Asexuality is when someone does not feel a sexual attraction to anyone. It is the lack of a sexual identity. Asexuals also sometimes refer to themselves as ""aces"". Some asexuals abhor sex entirely, some are ambivalent, some are willing to put up with it for someone they love. 

**G** : Gay refers to men who are romantically and/or sexually involved exclusively with other men. 

A lot of these are just barely scratching the surface of the information out there, especially my descriptions of intersex, trans and asexuality. Please let me know if you'd like more clarification, or have any questions. ",182

In Secret made me realize that the movie Thirst by Chan Wook Park (the guy who did Old Boy.

It's going well, but it is very challenging to see college kids coming out with knowledge that eclipses me. My previous company (I've since changed companies) wasn't a big fan of paying for education, so much of it was on the job training. I was able to get a bit of training out of them and got a certification in the field. It's basic, but it got me moving.

It is very challenging emotionally. As I said, there are tons of people with more experience, much younger, and making more money. Also, job hunting was hard. Whereas most people with my years of experience would be able to get a job with no problem, I struggled. Either the salary wasn't enough to put me where I was, or the job was far away, or not livable.

But, I don't regret it. It's a slow climb now. I'm mid 30s, so I have other responsibilities to balance against. I can't spend my nights studying into 2 am hours.  It's hard to rely on 'on the job' experience and training, but it has been working.

There are currently a few different groups of ""stateless"" people, who do not have a citizenship with any UN member nation, including the somewhat famous case of a former Iranian citizen who got stuck living in an airport for 18 years.

I managed to find it by sheer luck this week. First saw some scenes in the ""DJ S3RL - Hentai"" music video. It's very fitting by the way that this crazy aussie (in thebest sense of the word) would use it in his own video mix.

Then I saw some video where someone cosplayed as her and mentioned the name. I tried a few spellings and finally found it. So glad I did.

I like the video a lot because it tells a great story and is so well animated. I read somewhere that an animator or some other artist of Kill La Kill was involved and one other big name but I can't rember. Also the song is pretty cool.",3

A guy i know is weird as f*ck. He talks about things that he shouldnt be talking about, here it goes:

2: He caught his brother sucking his own dick on his bed and just told me about it like it was nothing.

3: He asked my girlfriend ""What will you do if I rape you"".

4: He was proud to tell his friends that he never brush his teeth or only wash himself once a month .
