"that the Japanese surrendered not because of the atomic bombs, but because of the soviet invasion that they weren't prepared for....

&gt;Tsuyoshi Hasegawa's research has led him to conclude that the atomic bombings were not the principal reason for Japan's capitulation. He argues that Japan's leaders were impacted more by the swift and devastating Soviet victories on the mainland in the week following Joseph Stalin's August 8 declaration of war because the Japanese strategy to protect the home islands was designed to fend off a US invasion from the South, and left virtually no spare troops to counter a Soviet threat from the North. This, according to Hasegawa, amounted to a ""strategic bankruptcy"" for the Japanese and forced their message of surrender on August 15, 1945.",3

Fucking Hunger Games though! Horrible, just horrible. I don't know if it's the director that made her act that way but fuck, I've never seen a more 1 dimensional character.

The second felt incredibly crammed in, too many people doing too many things with not even half enough time to make any of it compelling. Meanwhile a lot of time was wasted setting up one-liners, posing and I swear a large chunk of the film was just people boarding airships and nothing else.

Nobody, especially the antagonist, got anything like enough screen time to make them feel significant and the whole thing just left me not giving a shit about any of it. Whatever balance the first movie had, the second had lost after collapsing under the weight of more and more half-baked ideas.

"*here is a post I made sometime ago that is related to your question...*

When I was 18, I had a vivid dream that a faceless man took my hand to lead me away. When he grabbed my hand, I was filled with the most intense feeling that I had ever felt and knew that this was what being in love felt like. As he led me away, I was having a hard time keeping up and yelled out, ""wait, soandso!“ I woke up really sad because I wanted to keep feeling that intense love that I felt in the dream. I didn't personally know anyone named, soandso, at that time and never saw his face...but was convinced he was my soul mate and I would meet him. I only told one friend about my dream and we spent the next couple of weeks that summer going to parties and such...trying to meet a guy with that name. It doesn't happen and I forget about the dream and that name by the end of the summer.
Cut to two years later, I am working full time at a company and a new guy gets hired in the production department. He is cute, but he and I are both in relationships at the time. We end up becoming friends and lunch buddies. After about 3 months of becoming best friends at work, hanging out together outside of work, and breaking up with our relationships, we have an awkward lunch where we both admit that we feel something more than friendship and decide to start secretly dating...since we worked together.
After secretly dating for about a month, we are hanging out at my place and I realize that I'm in love with him. I had been in love before....but not like this. He was my best friend and lover, made me laugh like no other, and knew me better than anyone. I had never felt like this before. And then it hits me...I HAD felt like this before...in that dream I had 3 years prior. Then it hits me harder. The man sitting next to me on my couch has the same exact name as the one in my dream.

"My Senior year, some kids in my graduating class took a joyride in one of their parents' vans (vehicle, not the shoes.) They ended up crashing the van into a bunch of parked cars in the neighborhood. Nobody was wearing their seat belts, and apparently they were going pretty fast. None of them died, but they all suffered terrible injuries that needed major surgeries. I think at least one of them can't walk without a cane, and needed hip replacement. None of them graduated, either. They were the kind of kids who probably weren't going to graduate anyway. 

Edit: Shit, I forgot one more. Right after 9/11 my chemistry teacher had to go on maternal leave, so we had substitute teacher for a few days. I say a few days, because he didn't stay long after the incident. For those who had him, we ended up dubbing this guy Mr. McScary. I won't give his real name, but it sounded close to that. This guy was a die hard conspiracy theorist, and swore up and down that Anthrax was EVERYWHERE. He would tell us not to get on the NYC subways because Anthrax was on the poles and handrails at the stations. He'd pick up two chalk board erasers, bang them together, and yell ""that's the anthrax! You could all be DEAD!!"" 

He was reported a few times, but as far as I know he's still working as a sub for that school. ",2

"Not me, but a friend.

When I was in 6th grade, the gym teachers were gone for a meeting one day. There were three gym classes at that time of day, but instead of getting three substitutes they just had one, Mr. Evenson.

So all three classes (about ninety 6th graders) gathered in the same gym. We were doing the routine warmups such as pushups, situps, jumping jacks etc. Well this one kid, Adam, who was fairly popular, attractive, athletic and a bit of an entitled asshole decided he didn't need to do the warmups because we had a substitute teacher.

Mr. Evenson was walking around watching everyone while he called out the exercises and counted our reps. He eventually spots Adam and stops in front of him. ""Everyone stop!"", Mr. Evenson yells. Of course everyone stops. He asks Adam why he isn't participating to which Adam has no good answer. Evenson tells Adam that he is going to do the warmups while everyone watches. We all snicker but Adam's sure of himself, he'll play along.

He starts doing the pushups and does about five reps before Evenson stops him and says, ""Count them."" Adam begins, ""6,7,8...""
Evenson cuts in again, ""NO!. Start over!"" Adam is starting to get red in the face but continues, ""1,2,3..."" We are all laughing. ""LOUDER!"", yells Evenson. That was it, Adam bursts into tears, sobbing out the numbers as he counts. The class is silent. It was so awkward and brutal that no one made a noise. The silence must have pushed Adam over the edge because he just fell to the ground on his stomach, looked up at Mr. Evenson and shouted through his tears, ""THIS ISN'T THE ARMY!""

Ninety 6th graders explode with laughter. He just ran out of the gym crying, and we all played dodgeball.",6

Now with the Second World War and the Rise of Communism not taking place, the cold war would not have happened leading to no Korean war, Vietnam war or Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Many of the Communist dictatorships would have been prevented and the US backed dictatorships in Latin America would not have happened. If the cold war didn't happen, then the there would have been no justification for either the soviets or the US to take part in middle eastern affairs which would lead to no invasion of Afghanistan by the soviets or the Iranian revolution which aimed to overthrow the US backed Shah regime. Then without the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, that would not have given rise to the Taliban which would have lead to 9/11 not happening which would lead to no War on Terror, which would lead to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars not happening which would lead to Islamic extremism not Being so prevalent in the region.

"Digimon is so good! I mean, it's annoying that they pretty much completely invalidated the events of the first two seasons in the third season (the first two seasons were actually just video games in the universe of season three), but it makes up for that by actually being a lot darker and more serious than the first two. All three have their own advantages and quirks.

Do yourself a favor by not watching past season three, though. The first three seasons are the original story, but past that they just aren't the same. Frontier isn't terrible, and probably worth a watch, but they completely change the mechanics of the show by getting rid of Digimon partners and instead giving the human protagonists the ability to transform into Digimon.  
Data Squad is just a painful reboot of the original series, and they didn't even bother to make the main character's Digimon a clone of Agumon like Veemon or Guilemon and just makes Agumon again. This one feels a lot less like Digimon and a lot more like a generic anime, and it's clear in the art style.  
I never really watched Fusion, so I don't really know about the quality for that one. Probably still isn't as good as the first three.  
They're starting a six-part film series for the show's fifteenth year anniversary to be released as a direct sequel to Adventure and Adventure 02, taking place six years after the former and three years after the latter. I'm actually excited about this one, as it returns to the original cast and looks like it's going to be much higher quality than the past couple seasons. Hopefully they can capture how good the first seasons were.

But yeah, Pokémon games will forever be better, but Digimon is still a great show. In fact, Netflix has Japanese with subs for the first three seasons, which is pretty nice. The dub is so different that they actually count the sub and dub versions as different series.",2

God is objectively the best. Ever. If you want to accept the idea of the all knowing, loving, being God, then that God is objectively the best thing there is. God created us to live in community with him, giving us the opportunity to know him, which he is aware is literally the greatest thing ever. He creates us in his likeness, to be like him and know him. Because knowing him is the best thing ever. God is not weak or imperfect because of creation. He made creation perfect, he made it out of love for us. We screwed it up, but he still loves us regardless.

"I once worked at a student help desk.

Due to how scheduling usually went, people would take odd hours in between classes and such. When somebody had to leave for class, the standard procedure was for that leaving person to give their current jobs to somebody else who was on shift the next hour and explain what was going on with each machine. When they are done with the job, they close the ticket. It's pretty straight forward, and each job was quick enough that we could do that (30 minutes or less usually).

We also frequently manned the front as much as possible. Manning the front was where you could talk with customers, write up the tickets, and get homework done. It was also an expectation that you rotated tasks so that you had a somewhat equal workload.

Well this one guy, we'll call him Tom. Tom's a very smart guy, I'll give him that. But he doesn't go to work because he enjoys the work. In fact, he pushes work onto other people as much as he can. He would man the front often and assign tickets to me towards the end of my shift, in fact I was first on his mental queue. I'd ask him to take over the jobs (which I would explain) at the end of my shift. Unfortunately, many of my tickets didn't get closed or were not complete. I eventually got a complaint from a manager about incomplete tickets, but what was I supposed to do? I can't stay and then be late for my classes.

The managers eventually used this in addition to my increased schoolwork load to claim I was not dependable and let me go. I am still a little pissed off a bit about the circumstances, but it's probably best that I am no longer working there. My friends who still work there dislike how things are currently run.

"Flying in an F-15.


I enlisted in the USAF 9 years ago.  I would say i've had a pretty successful career up to this point as I've received two incentive flights to date.  The first was when i was TDY to Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  It was kinda impromptu and i didn't bring a camera with me so i couldn't even take any pictures.  The aircraft was an F-15C model.

The second time was a reward for winning a MAJCOM level annual award.  It was supposed to be like the first, just a familiarization type flight.  The pilot takes you up and fly's around a bit, just having fun in the air.  Due to some freakish mother nature a couple days beforehand it got cancelled. (Wind so strong the sunshades actually blew over and damaged everything that was in them)  A couple weeks later they set me up to tag along on a training flight.  Two F-15E pilots were practicing their dog fighting skills and i got to tag along with one of them.  I was super hyped because it was originally supposed to be in an F-16 but thanks to that freakish wind i would get to fly in my favorite fighter, the Strike Eagle.

This was simultaneously the most awesome and painful experience of my life.  I had flown once before so i had some idea what it would be like, but again, this was them basically trying to shoot each other down.  Flipping around, pulling high Gs, i threw up three times on that flight.  The pilot actually asked me if they needed to tone it down for me.  I said not to worry about me, i'm having a blast.  

The worst part is i had a camera with me this time, but didn't take any meaningful pictures (i got three of the speedway next to Nellis AFB from the cockpit but nothing special)

On the plus side i got a certificate with all the mission information on it, a copy of the mission card, and a unit patch from one of the pilots.  This memory will forever be engraved into my brain, too bad i can't really share it with other people.",4

In the Outaouais the language police often don't even bother enforcing Bill 101, while north of Quebec City I get the sense that the ugly '95-style pure-laine nationalism still has a pretty strong foothold (probably because there aren't any anglophones living there so no one gets to know them and realize they aren't so bad).  That said, I've never personally had anyone treat me badly because I don't speak French, and I've spent a lot of time in different parts of Quebec.  All the actual ""bad blood"" I've seen in person has been people on the Ontario side irrationally disliking Quebec and Quebecois people (of course it's always people who don't know any Quebecois people and often have never even been to Quebec).

So Americans (and English Canadians) - don't be afraid to visit Quebec!  It's a beautiful place with really good food and the people there are way friendlier than the rest of Canada makes them out to be.

"There are 16x (40x if you count the metro area) as many people living in NYC compared to the State of Wyoming, but the citizens of Wyoming _also_ have a right to have a voice in matters affecting the entire country. The 10 largest metropolitan areas in the US have nearly 80 million people, but the 10 largest cities are not representative of the nation as a whole. 

The major population centers generally aren't the swing states. There isn't much of a fight for California or Texas. The large electoral vote states are usually a fairly even split between parties. The swing states (Ohio for example) tend to be more representative of the country as a whole. They have cities and rural areas, farming and industry, and a fairly balanced split of Red and Blue. 

The reason so many recent elections come down to the swing states is that America overall is pretty evenly divided politically. ",5

"It's sort of a sharp, knife like pain, for me though it was in very specific areas directly underneath and just above my kneecaps, and the 'lines of pain' were very thin, maybe 1/2 a centimeter wide, and between 1 and 2 inches long. For me, there's literally nothing they can do, just give my pain killers to help me cope. It's non operable. It's called Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome if you're curious. I was using a cane for the few days after I got it checked out, they even did an X-Ray just to make sure I hadn't like, splintered a bone or something.

When I was walking, the pain would get sharper and more intense, and when I stopped moving my knees, it would die down for a moment or two and then flare up again and then stay somewhere in the middle. It also felt like my knees were creaking a lot, I would get the vibration and everything. Sometimes, it'll hurt so bad that my ankles and my hips hurt too, the pain sort up shoots up a line in my thigh and goes right to my hip joints, but there's no such pain line to my ankles when this happens. It's interesting.

If you have knee problems, I suggest going to a doctor because if it goes untreated long enough, you may have to get knee replacement surgery that could've been avoided. Hope this helps.",2

"I have had an emergency c-section, infertility treatments involving daily hormone shots in my hips (for months, my hips were so swollen I could not sleep on them), egg removal, and a radical hysterectomy with oopherectomy (ovary removal), as well as 4 impacted wisdom teeth, and a thrown back. Ranked in order of least to most painful; The C-section was my first surgery ever, and thanks to an epidural, not too bad. I helped my brother and sister-in-law move two weeks later. Daily hormone injections in my hips were no fun. My hips were so sore, and I had to keep injecting into already inflamed and swollen tissue. I went up two dress sizes because of the swelling, and I had to sleep on my back. This was done for 2 months. 4 impacted wisdom teeth- they should have been removed, but we had no dental insurance, so I just had to leave them. Periodically, they would shift, in an attempt to come out. When that happened, my gums would swell, and I could literally feel the grinding and shifting as they pushed on my other teeth. This would give me massive headaches, where any sound, light or touch would make me see red. Eventually, they all came in. Egg retrieval- part of my infertility journey was to be given hormones to make my ovaries ""create"" as many eggs as possible. I then had to go in and have these removed from my ovaries. They take a take an ultrasound probe that has a needle on it and place it in your vagina, and then the needle goes through the vaginal wall and into your ovaries to collect the eggs. Repeat for as many eggs as you made, for me that was 16. I was unconscious during the process, but when I awoke I could feel all the spots where they had put the needle, through the vagina as well as through both ovaries. I had to get up and walk afterwards and nearly passed out. Radical hysterectomy with oopharectomy. Due to cancer I had chemotherapy, but still needed to have my uterus, ovaries, and my cervix removed. A regular hysterectomy is typically done through the vagina, so no outside incisions. Due to everything else they were removing on me, they had to go through my abdomen. Removing the cervix meant that they literally just stitched up the top of the vaginal walls. The soreness and pain from surgery was one thing, and pretty intense in and of itself, but due to all the manipulations and changes sex was painful for over a year, and some positions still are, even 6 years later. My pelvic muscles were over-tight, and of course the scar tissue where they removed my cervix was a huge issue. I have a 5"", puckered scar on my lower tummy from all of that. I think throwing my back out still tops all of that. ",3
Carry on my waaaayyward soooon,2
"When I was in middle to high school, I had a pretty bad depression problem. I - stupidly - took up smoking weed to stave off the depressive thoughts, which got pretty bad at times. It did work temporarily, but it really wasn't worth it in the long run because if I took time off from smoking I'd get an even worse depressive episode than if I never smoked.  
Fast forward and my parents both know that I smoked - which I had gotten seriously busted for - and I had a therapist. One session which my dad was present for, the topic of drug use came up, and my therapist asked my dad if he had ever used the ol' Devil's Cabbage. To my surprise, my dad said he did in college; this was a shock to me because my dad is one of the most straight-laced introverts you'll ever meet. He's seen Uriah Heep live though, and listened to a lot of prog rock so really, it shouldn't have been a big surprise. Before I got busted as well, he seemed to always suspect when I was high, whereas my mom who has never done any drug in her life was clueless.  
  
On the way home, we talked about how he smoked in college, including one hilarious story where he cut wrestling practice to smoke with his roommate and his hardass wrestling coach walked in, only to not realize what was happening despite the bong on an adjacent table. He then told me to never tell my mother about his stoner days, and we've never talked about it again.",2

"I was mature for my age, I had long hair, I could grow a decent beard, and I kept it neat. I was a rocker looking guy in the early 90's, so tight jeans and metal band t-shirts were my attire. I often spoke candidly to my teachers about sex, drugs, and music, and had seen and conversed with several outside of school, male and female.

I had one teacher, Carol, for American Lit that I like to embarrass by making sexual innuendo laced jokes during discussions on the stories we were reading. She was friends with another teacher, Suzie, who was really attractive, but single, and couldn't get dates for some reason. 

I had seen Suzie around town, and spoke to her on occasion. She taught Geometry. The summer after Junior year, I ended up taking English in summer school because I didn't do a term paper and failed it during the regular school year, and Suzie was there. I wasn't up for conversation with most of the other students, and we were allowed to leave the school for lunch, so, on occasion, I'd see Suzie eating somewhere, and join her.

That's when I learned she used to be really overweight in college, and had anxiety about dating, because the guy might find out, as some had, and stop seeing her. I had basically said that was all in the past, and she was beautiful now.

Suzie looked like Kirstie Alley when she was on Cheers. She was tall, probably 6', in her early 30's, she had a nice figure, and dressed nicely, with a lot of low cut blouses. The guys in class would always pretend to be struggling with a problem to get her to lean over their desk to help. She was aware of this. Her college weight problem had a side effect of leaving her with large bosoms once she lost the weight.

So one day, I'm talking to Carol, and she said she was going to the movies that night, to see Pretty Woman for the 10th time (not kidding), and. Suzie was going. Then it came ""Why don't you come along? Like a date. For Suzie?""

That's where it started. Things happened, as they will, but nothing serious.

After I graduated, I went to one of my high school's football games, and Suzie was there. She was supposed to go to the game with a boyfriend, but he came with someone else. She asked me to hold her hand, and make him jealous, and we eventually went back to her car.

I had heard of legal cases about this before, and there have been many after, but I never felt like I was coerced into anything. I have fond memories of my times with Suzie.",2

"It'd be easier to think the Nazis were all hopped up on drugs, when it comes to their actions, but I highly doubt drug abuse was that rampant. Sometimes upbringing, brain washing, propaganda, ignorance, and mob mentality are all you need to do awful awful things. The American pioneers weren't doped up when eradicating the American indians, and the southerners weren't mainlining pcp when they whipped their black slaves. Normal people can do some fucked up shit.

Edit: I have no sympathy for the Nazis, but they weren't drugged up, they weren't *insane*. They were the result of normal people being fed bad info, for a long time, and whose resulting rage was encouraged. That's why it's so important that you ensure your rage against a person or people is *actually valid*, and not just reverb in an echo chamber.

After we had drained an almost full tank of gas we go refill, buy a gallon of milk, then he drove us home. 

The second one. When i was a teenager i used to smoke weed. I knew he smoked every once in while. My mom had no clue either of us did. When he found my stash he would take a joints worth for himself then hide it somewhere else in the house. Then he would leave a folded up note that said ""its somewhere else in the house i hope you find it before your mother does."" ",3

I recommend budgeting for your wedding at least 6 months before the date, which should give you enough time to figure things out... 

Example of how to save more: say you need to save another 15k to throw the event you want, and say you are 6 months away from the event.  1. Spend the first week asking family (both bride and groom) if you can borrow ""$X""...let's say they are willing to float you $5k combined... now you have 6 months to get another $10k,  which is about $1.5k a month, or,  if you work 30 days a month,  $50 more each day. 2. Now ask yourself -- Can you make that money by working overtime? Can you make that money by tutoring people/kids a skill like math/ piano/ skateboarding for $20 an hour?  3. Sing-up for lots of online survey jobs that usually pay~$100 for your opinions/ other. 

Basically,  do what you can to make sure you earn another $50 a day or $350 (working weekends), and after your wedding,  figure out a way to pay back the family. 

Hope this helps!

"During the great hovel boom of 1305, a few secluded scribes discover that the liege lords have been greatly inflating the price of their fiefs to raise money for tournament and sport. The scribes, being in the small portion of society that can read, don't really do anything because they are part of the church and the church would excommunicate the liege lords and then they, the scribes, would be executed afterwards. Best way to keep your head above water, is to keep attached to your head. ",12

"My parents decided to legally give me the english spelling of my name,  but when I found out who I was named after I chose to go buy the irish spelling and sm considering doing it legally. My name isnt hugely irish (Jesse) but my parents were worried I was going to be bullied for having a 'boys name'. I wish they had named me Jesse from the start so I wouldnt have to do the legal thing. 

It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks- if you and your partner like it the only consideration is childhood bullying. I dont know if anyone would bully a kid with a different name really- my friend niamh had people telling her her name was cool (although none of her birthday cards had quite the right spelling)",2

"Zoidberg is my low key favorite because of how relatable he is. He just wants people to like him but everybody constantly makes fun of him. He is lonely almost constantly, for example in the episode where he tries to find a mate and none of his species find him attractive. He doesn't really fit in anywhere but still desperately tries his best to help the people that are around him, even if they don't care about him.

He's one of those characters that you never notice when he isn't there, and the show really wouldn't be all that different without him. That's why I like him so much.",5

"September 7 2015 (labor day), in Los Angeles County. 

Anyone that lives in the inner city in Los Angeles knows how shitty parking can be. I pay a landlord for parking space in this gated parking lot and it's awesome despite the fact that someone did a stakeout and I involuntarily helped someone almost steal a car once. You can read that story in my profile. Anyways, it takes me about two minutes walking at a consistent rate to get from my house to my car door. I usually just try to walk as fast as I can while paying attention to my surroundings because the path to the gate is through a sketchy alley.


I was alone in my house and it was pretty late. I hate going to sleep on an empty stomach so I decided to get something to eat. Again, this being the ghetto and having to walk through a sketchy ass alley I make sure I'm always looking behind me and to the sides to make sure a druggie, bum, or gangbanger doesnt try to attack me or something. For some reason though I look up at the sky. This isn't something I regularly do due to the light pollution here so there isn't really much to look at. For some reason though this fucking star has me at full attention. I can't stop staring at it. There was no physical feeling or ""need"" to stare at it, it was more of me not being able to wrap my head around this thing. It was like I've never seen a star before. Along the way I saw the flickering lights of planes passing by and the twinkle of other stars around but this star was so bright and alive like if it was conscious at the fact that I was looking at it. There it stood unmoving while I walked through the alley.


I finally reach the electronic gate and I reach my pocket for the remote. No sooner do I press the button does this star take off. It went from being absolutely still to flying away faster than any airliner I've ever seen. Really freaked me out and all I wanted to do was get into the safety of my car.",6
