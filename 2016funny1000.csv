"That's part of it, but I think for a lot of people it's more about how they get and keep their money than what they do with it. Sure nobody likes a spoiled rich kid that knows nothing of the reality most live in, but it's the people buying politicians and committing crimes that they're too rich to be held accountable for that really piss people off. 

Most people don't care if you made money by producing a product that people actually want and use. It's when you start abusing people, the environment, and everything else around you that it really upsets people. When you make $100 billion committing crimes but just pay $100 million in fees when you are caught, or you lobby to get a terrible bankruptcy bill passed because it's profitable for financial institutions, or you destroy the economy by giving out ridiculously unsafe loans and then demand that the government bails you out to cover the losses on investments you should never have made... that's when it should go beyond ""ugh stupid spoiled rich guy"" and become ""holy shit why do we let this happen""",165

I'm was in a very busy fabric store waiting to get a few bolts cut while I had my 2 &amp; 3 year old daughters with me. The 2 year old was only recently potty trained. I watched her wander around a corner, so naturally I went to see what she was doing. She's squatting, pants around her ankles, about to poop in the middle of the floor. I throw the fabric down (realizing time is of the essence and the bathroom is on the other end of the store), snatch her up, and take off running towards the bathroom. 

This is what everyone sees: A mad woman dashing with an exposed toddler vagina thrown over her shoulder screaming, ""Don't you dare poop on me!!!"", a crying toddler screaming, ""BUT I HAVE TO POOOOOOP!"", and a crying 3 year old running as fast as she can completely panicked yelling, ""DON'T LEAVE ME, MAMA!! COME BAAAAAACK!"". 

We did make it there, just barely. I mean I was tossing her on the toilet as she was starting to poop. I walk back out, head held high, because hey, I just saved everyone from having to smell and witness that literal hot mess. I kid you not, some people were actually GLARING at me. That really made me mad. Screw the fabric. I looked at them and snapped, ""Like you've never seen a baby vagina before!"" and proudly walked out of the store screaming on the inside. For real though.

We try to get him to sit down but getting some milk from the store is like a mission to him now. It must get done. He eventually sneaks out while no one notices. We eventually realize he's gone and call him. No answer. We keep calling him. No answer for half an hour. We're getting worried.

* We arrive at Peet's Coffee Shop
* They have exactly 1 handicapped space in a small lot
* That space is next to a planted area with a garden
* There is a fire engine red Lamborgini in the spot
* No placard, no handicapped tag
* We park our car at his bumper, blocking him in, and the front of our car extends to the planted garden area, so the only person blocked is the lamborgini
* We go inside and sit by the window and watch our car
* Guy comes out of a Fed Ex store nearby and walks to his car and starts going ape-shit because he's blocked
* Asks around, comes into the Peet's, asks around
* Boyfriend says ""Yup, that's our car.""
* Lamborgini says ""I was in a rush to get inside Fed Ex, I was only there 10 minutes tops.""
* Boyfriend says ""Well, we're having our coffee, now. We'll only be 10 minutes, tops.""
* Lamborgini says ""Move your fucking car NOW!""
* Boyfriend says ""Naw, we'll be about 10 minutes tops.""
* Lamborgini says ""Do I need to call the cops?!""
* Boyfriend says ""Please do.  If they tell me to move, I will.""
* Lamborgini calls the cops and says ""I'm being blocked in a parkign lot by some asshole who refuses to move.""
* CHP (California Highway Patrol) shows up in fairly short order as this is a busy downtown area.
* We go outside and introduce ourselves, coffee in hand, ready to leave.  We point out the situation.  Say we're ready to go, but wanted to be sure the CHP saw why we blocked him in.
* CHP laughs and says ""Sure do.""  Writes up a ticket.  Hands it to the Lamborgini guy, citing him for parking in a handicapped space.
* He stands there flabbergasted realizing he just called the CHP on himself, and earn himself his own $250 violation citation.  He was agape as we thanked him for patiently waiting for the CHP to arrive, and we drove away.",118

I thought crossing the road at night made him culpable, but he just said he was ~~foraging~~ working night shifts, and suggesting that is discriminating against those with low socioeconomic statuses and have to work overnight. I thought the dark fur, which blends into the trees and bushes, was part of the cause too. But I was plainly called a ""racist"" for even suggesting that.

"Biblically, the word ""world"" refers to everything; earth, the planets, space, the solar system, other planets.  It refers to all of creation.

Recently, it has come to mean only our planet.  However, many fantasy/sci-fi novels will oven talk of other dimensions as different worlds, each with their own planetary systems and physical properties.  This seems to suggest that ""world"" can mean more than just our planet.

While I don't fully agree with this, I do think that ""world"" is somehow more than just a planet.  While we talk of the possibility of other worlds in the galaxy, it is strange to think of our solar system as having other worlds.   There is only one world in our solar system, and that is earth.  The other planets don't feel like worlds to me.  Perhaps that is because they are barren of life.  Maybe you need life to be a world.  Since ours is the only known planet to have life, the world may as well be the known universe...

Dante Hicks: Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at... 

Randal Graves: Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? All they know is killing and white uniforms. 

Dante Hicks: All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction? 

Randal Graves: All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed - casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. 

[notices Dante's confusion]

Randal Graves: All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia - this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits.

"The problem is in a single place that memory is stored. Say that I have a 16 byte buffer in memory, but one bit is stuck. So, I have this:

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F  
    [_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * _ _ _ _]

Say that byte B has this error (marked with *). The rest of the memory is fine.

If I copy my username into this buffer, nothing bad happens:

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F  
    [C h i s 1 0 1 _ _ _ _ * _ _ _ _]

Everything is fine because we didn't hit the bad byte.

Now, in that same section of memory, let's copy your name

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F  
    [a n c i e n t o r a n g e _ _ _]

Uh-oh, the 'g' in your username got put in the bad memory.

g is 01100111, where (counting from left) bit 5 is stuck at 0. Luckily, that's what it's supposed to be. So, everything looks fine.

Let's say we wanted to fill the buffer with all N's.

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F  
    [N N N N N N N N N N N F N N N N]

See how we got lots of N's correctly, but since B has that stuck bit, the one we tried to store in that position turned into an F.

So, since only a single bit is incorrectly being stored by the memory, you get 'random' corruption like shown by OP. You can luck out and nothing important gets stored in that place, or what is stored in it happens to want to be the value it's stuck at anyways. When this happens, you don't notice a problem. However, when something important (or visible, as is the case here) is put in that place, then you run into problems.

She got the kitten and hugged on him pressing his softness against her face, he's a bit of a ragdoll.

This is one of those times that I won't ever know what was going on in her mind, and I will probably never see her again. But I felt a weird kind of unconditional love for her in that brief exchange. 

One of my dogs had liver disease at the time and ended up dying of liver failure within a week of this exchange. This pizza girl's love for my dogs did a lot for me to help me get through that.

Size: Body, 34 to 43 in (86 to 109 cm); Wingspan, 6 to 8 ft (1.8 to 2.4 m) Weight: 6.5 to 14 lbs (3 to 6.5 kg)

   Diet: fish, but they get many of their meals by scavenging carrion or stealing the kills of other animals. They live near water and favor coasts and lakes where fish are plentiful, though they will also snare and eat small mammals.

  Diet: This species’ reptile prey includes large lizards and occasionally snakes, and it may take birds such as crows, parrots, ducks and even herons, cranes and bustards (2) (4).

Carrion is also an important food source for the wedge-tailed eagle, particularly during winter or for younger birds which lack hunting experience.  This powerful eagle is capable of taking prey several times its own weight, although most of its prey is much smaller than this.",251

"I'm a lifelong trek fan and recently rewatched the classics, and I'm can't agree. The three seasons of Star-Trek: ToS were indeed very cerebral and focused on diplomacy and intellect to solve problems. 

Starting with the very first Star Trek movie that changed. Those movies WERE action movies, for the time. The original movie had the most in common with the show, but the very next movie: Wrath of Khan was absolutely trying to be an action movie. No, there wasn't some muscle bound dude blowing away terrorists, but it was absolutely focused on the action. There were more space battles than the show, there were more fights and the resolutions to the main plots ALWAYS involved explosions. 

The new movies follow that tradition, but they were made in  a time when we *really* know how to make a movie action packed. I know Abrahms wasn't a ST fan, I know I'm not supposed to like them, but I absolutely do. They get rid of the monologues, the unnecessary plot additions (why is Kirk ALWAYS on a last hurrah in the original movies?) and they focus on what the movies, not the show, were all about: huge world ending conflicts that the crew solved through guts, action and intellect. 

People need to take off the rose colored glasses. It's 2016, I'm sorry, we aren't going back to the intellectual, almost pacifist captains of the shows. Hell, the original show got canned after three seasons. Next gen was WAY more action packed and they ended up getting nine some odd seasons and a ton of popular movies, because people haven't enjoyed watching people stand around talking on a spaceship since...well, never, the original series got canceled. 

Also, aside from Star Trek: The Movie, have ANY of the Star Trek movies not been action movies? ",123

The first time you get blamed for something, open the first letter. The second time you get blamed for something, open the second letter.""

Time passes and sure enough, the new head of the KGB gets blamed for something going wrong, so he opens the first letter. All it says is ""Blame me.""

So the new head of the KGB blames the old head of the KGB and he is let off the hook.

More time passes and the new head of the KGB gets blamed for something else going wrong so he opens the second letter.

But all it says is ""Write two letters.""

"Rules for living in the apartment above me.


Thanks to the ""Bonus Gravity"" provided by my landlords, whoever moves in above me will weigh approximately nine times their normal weight. To remind me that you got the ""Bonus Gravity"" deal, please make sure to stomp your huge, ham-filled feet every step you take. If I cannot track your current location to within a centimeter, you aren't doing your job. 

When not watching television, you should take it off the TV stand and face it, screen down, at the floor. Make sure to turn the volume up as loud as possible. If I cannot hear what lesson Kimmy Gibbler learned today on ""Full House"", I will petition for your eviction. 

The best time for your idiot friends to come over is between 2:00 and 8:00 am or whenever I'm sleeping. Once you see my lights turn off, make sure your crazy pal Eddie is on his way over with that DVD of ""The World's Largest Explosions - Caught on Film!"" 

All of your phones must have their ringer hooked up to a bass guitar amplifier. This way, when your phone rings for the 10,000th consecutive time without you picking it up, I will realize you must've accidentally tripped over and broke your 1500-pound skull on the coffee table and I should probably alert the proper authorities. 

When shutting doors, pretend the Grim Reaper himself is chasing you throughout your house. Slam them as hard as possible to prevent him from sneaking into your place causing the hundreds of filthy plants you own to die. 

Taking a shower at 3:00 am is perfectly acceptable. Since my apartment is lined with hundreds of different pipes which carry water to approximately 17 different countries, make sure to urge your friends to take showers at the same time. 

Every day at 8:00 pm, you should drop something large and heavy such as: 
-A refrigerator 
-A wheelbarrow full of lead and concrete 
-A month's collection of all the Slim Jims and yahoo you consume 
-The entire world 

If you don't have access to any of those items, then just trip and fall over. Try to at least be holding some cinder blocks while doing so. 

When speaking to a friend who has come over to visit and toss bowling balls around your apartment, make sure to use a megaphone whenever laughing at something he says. This way I'll know your friend is a very funny and witty man (who cannot catch bowling balls). 

The ""bass"" knob on your stereo stands for ""Better Acoustic Sounding Songs"" and should be cranked up as loud as possible to reflect quality. Try to listen only to rap, techno, and anything which features a kick drum the size of a delivery van. If the song has lyrics, you should turn the bass up so high that it sounds like the the singer is repeatedly chanting, ""mwog bbblrrgm gwaf."" 

Don't ever leave your apartment. Ever. Ypsilanti air is known for its trace amounts of cyanide floating around in it, so it's safer for you to simply hibernate in there for the next nine years. 

Much like in exciting video games, hitting surrounding objects with a hammer may reveal magic prizes hidden inside. Smack everything you can find with a hammer or large wooden board. Then smack the wooden board with a hammer because, who knows, it might be a trick. 

When the power in the entire block goes out at 10:00 PM and you notice everybody else's lights are off, be sure to shout, ""DID THE POWER GO OFF?!?"" out your window. There could be a family a few miles away that still has power, in which case you could go over to their house and borrow a cup of electricity so you may operate the jackhammer you've got going in your kitchen.

"Life... is a sandbox video game.

You have a brief tutorial, about 15 years, but it doesn't explain everything in the slightest, really, outside from basic controls.

Character generation is completely random, which sucks.  However, ability progression is extremely intuitive, though it can get really, really grindy.

Very few activities are absolutely required.  Food, shelter, and some way to heal are about it.  Think Minecraft.

However, there are a lot of things to do.  The gameworld is huge.  Like really, really huge.  Not a lot of direction though.  You kinda gotta do that yourself.

Some NPCs will help you.  Some will hurt you.  Most are simply filler, or shops that sell premium items.  However, there is a fairly cool system where you can invest experience in certain NPCs, and thus improve your relationship with them.  Doesn't work on all of them, though.

Main thing is, though, you have to find your own goals.  There really aren't a lot of quest givers, and a bunch of the ones that do exist kinda give out repeating missions.

You have to find your own joy in the game.  You have to explore, or figure out which activities make you happiest.  You have to play the game you want to play, given the resources you can get.

And no, I'm not some enlightened moron who is always happy.  I struggle with this constantly, wondering what the grind really amounts to.  But you have to keep going.  Find a bit you like, and work at it.

There are no saves.  There isn't a sequel.  There is no other server.  This is what we got.  We have to make it work.

Yep. I had a friend that got married just before deployment. He was supposed to get shipped off but wound up getting out for a disability just before. His wife was angry because she was hooking up with the guy that was helping them out to prepare for his shipping out. She wound up divorcing him when the military pay and insurance gave out. She had even talked him into changing his job from surgical tech to combat medic. In the ensuing fighting she even told him that she had hoped he would get killed in Iraq so she would get the money. Worst person I've ever known.,558

"Let me tell you a story about my dad. A few years ago, we had a severe snow storm that dumped about 3 feet of snow in 2 days. My dad spent 4 hours shoveling out the parking area in front of our house so that he could park his and my grandma's vehicles. While he was out there shoveling, the neighbors a few doors down, who are all 20 something college students, just watched him shovel and never offered to help. 

When he finished and went to put the shovel away and get the first vehicle to move from the alley, the college students ran out to their vehicles and parked their 3 small cars in the cleared area.

My dad went down the block for a few minutes, talked to someone at the front door, and then 2 minutes later, all 3 college kids ran out and moved there vehicles back to where they were originally parked.

After he finished moving the vehicles and had cleaned up, he came in the house. I asked him what he had said to them, to make them move their vehicles.

He replied, ""I went over and asked them to move their vehicles, but they said they didn't have to because no one owns the space in front of their house, and one was a law student who said they had covered this in class. I told them I wasn't demanding they move them because I knew I didn't ""own"" the space in front of the house, but that I wanted them to move them to protect their vehicles. When they asked me what I meant by ""protect"" their vehicles, I explained to them how, in the winter, sometimes all four tires will deflate on a car in front of our house, and the hoods of the cars will be found open with the batteries gone. I didn't want that to happen to a bunch of college kids who didn't want to miss class because of car issues. That would be a real shame, especially during exam review and prep before finals.""

An hour later, one of the guys who just got to their house, came to ask my dad if they could borrow some shovels. My dad loaned them two and went and helped them shovel some of the snow.",211

&gt;The truck stopped after passing the toll station and firefighters took 20 minutes to extinguish the flames. According to the truck driver, he had the truck inspected at a service center during the trip and found nothing wrong with it.",134

"I needed to buy a fancy vest for New Years. If you look up fancy vests on Amazon, the more inexpensive ones all appear to come from Japan. They have a fancy little size chart that basically equates an American medium to a Japan XL.

I'm a very tall man, but I'm pretty skinny. As vests don't have arms, I figured I could fit into a medium (XL), and ordered one. The vest arrives and I'm able to button it, but it's *really tight*, like bunching up my undershirt tight. So I decided to return it and order the large (XXL).

Keep in mind I checked the tags throughout this entire process, and they were all correct.

When the XXL arrived, I went to put it on and immediately realized something was wrong when I struggled to get my arms through it. This one *was too small to button*.

Yes, the XXL was smaller than the XL. So I said screw it, spent like $10 extra getting an American Brand, and when that came it was like a size too large.

Buying vests is a pain in the ass. Would not recommend.",149

"Back when I was in first grade, my teacher informed the class that we could pronounce ""Uranus"" as either ""Yurr-ANUS"" or ""URINE-us."" The latter choice sounded more correct to me for whatever reason, and so I took to using it whenever we talked about the planet in question. 

At least, I did until my friend Tyler - feigning a maturity beyond his years - literally pulled me over to one corner of our classroom.

""Max,"" he whispered, ""you need to know something.""

""Okay,"" I replied. I faced my ear toward him and leaned in close, as was the standard practice for receiving secrets.

""No, it's not that,"" Tyler said. ""It's not a secret. It's just that *some people*, in the old days, would say 'urine' when they meant *pee*.""

I had been familiar with the word ""urine"" prior to that moment (although I hadn't realized it was such an allegedly archaic term), but I hadn't made the connection between it and the pronunciation of a planet name.

""What about 'anus,' though?"" I countered.

Tyler stared at me. ""What's wrong with 'anus?'""

""Well, *some people*, in the old says, would say 'anus' when they meant *butt-hole*.""

This was apparently too much for my friend to accept, and even harder for him to contemplate without giggling. Worse still, neither of the two options seemed superior to the other, given that both of them brought naughty imagery to mind. We wound up approaching our teacher together in an attempt to resolve the ""argument,"" and it ultimately spawned a class discussion that got out of control *really* fast. It was thereafter referred to as ""The Pee or Butt Talk.""

We never did come to a consensus, though.

"The first (and only) time me and my now Mrs bought condoms while out shopping together, we decided to use the brand new self service check out to avoid any awkward eye contact. Guess what the only item in our basket that wouldn't scan? Cue flashing light and a computer voice asking for assistant. Assistant couldn't scan them either so he thought it would be a good idea to call a colleague over the tanoy to help. They both couldn't get it to beep so they called over a passing shelf stacker over and asked her to go and get another packet to try. By this time my wife had walked off and I told them not to bother as I didn't think I'd by getting laid that night after all.

Edit:
It seems there is a massive divide between people who can get slightly embarrassed and people who are so confident in life that if they went to pick the kids up from school and they're zipper was undone and cock was hanging out it would be the other parents problem for being so prudish.

The thing is we're English the only thing we're supposed to buy is tea bags and if they wouldn't scan I'd  feel awkward for holding the queue up. 
The thing is people can be embarrassed about any thing from having a spot on their face (God! What's your problem it's just a build up of oil and dirt trapped in your pores it's perfectly natural) to falling down some stairs in front of a crowded room (God!  What's your problem it's only the law of gravity it's perfectly natural) it's one of the many things that makes us all different and interesting and also one of the main bases of a lot of comedy. For example off the top of my head the scene in bridesmaids where they are all shitting themselves while trying on dresses. It's funny because it's embarrassing for them. Do the ultra confident watch something like that and say (I imagine in a nasily voice) ""I don't know what their problem is. They've had some bad prawns and it's perfectly natural for your body to reject it in this way""
The buying of condoms especially for the first time has been a subject of embarrassment for generations

He makes a cameo appearance in the ""Beat It"" cover video from Fall Out Boy [music video pic](http://imgur.com/PfsROqP). He co-starred with Katharine McPhee playing her love interest in her music video ""It's Not Christmas Without You"" for her Christmas album Christmas Is the Time to Say I Love You.

Fun fact, in an episode of ""Bones"", Moore's character Dr. Fisher invites his colleagues to camp out overnight to see the movie ""Avatar"". In reality, Joel had a significant role in the actual ""Avatar"" film.

Edit: Changed place on Hatchet and Dodgeball img. Thanks kayrunm for noticing!

Edit 2: Joel seems to be a hard working man, apart from above he has lately been starring in:

* He most recently popped up in 'The Guest' which was a nice surprise. (Thanks Scuzzfest)
* He was in an ABC show called ""Forever"" and did a great job (Thanks Sunsparc) [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n2cvJK6bLc)
* He also does a pretty good impression of Joey Ramone in the movie CBGB with Allan Rickman (Thanks Ericovich) [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMdPTzb6PmU)
* Be sure to check out ""Art School Confidential"" (2006) with John Malkovich. (Thanks deadowl) [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C543t9FDYLU)",222

So we had this set for as long as I can remember, at least since the late 70's/early 80's.

My step-dad, ever the jokester, starts telling him all about the dishes, how wonderful they are and that they are unbreakable. Then he says, ""See, watch,"" and proceeds to throw one of the bowls down on the hard linoleum kitchen floor where, as one might expect, the 15 year old bowl practically explodes on impact. 

Without missing a beat, step-g-pa says, ""Wow! That's amazing! Let me try,"" and throws down his bowl on the the kitchen floor, where it also proceeds to shatter into a million pieces.

"When I had just moved into my first apartment during college, my upstairs neighbor, unbeknownst to me, kept a log of all my daily activities (everything from when I showered, when I cooked, cleaned, watched TV, dropped a deuce, jerked off, etc), would tabulate and summarize the data neatly, and slide it under my door when I wasn't home. 

The first time I saw it I was totally shocked and freaked out (as it was eerily accurate). At the time I had no idea who was doing it, so I raised the issue with management who found it entertaining and didn't seem to care that I found it super creepy and inappropriate. I even subtly dropped hints with neighbors to see if anyone would fess up to it or clue me in, but no joy. 

This went on for months, and the ""report submission"" was erratic so I could never catch the neighbor in the act. Finally one day I pretended to leave my apartment, went across the street and hid behind some parked cars. I waited for over an hour and eventually saw my  upstairs neighbor come out of his apartment, acting super cagey, so I figured it had to be him. There was just something about the guy that rubbed me the wrong way. 

I watched the big fellow lumber down the stairs, walk over to my door, glance around nervously while producing a manila envelope from inside his jacket and slid it under my door. It was only then, with his jacket partially open that it revealed something I had thus far failed to notice, which was that my neighbor  was approximately 5 stories tall and in fact a crustacean from the paleozoic era. We made eye contact for but a brief moment, when the owner of the car I was hiding behind approached me asking for about tree fiddy to feed the meter. By the time I turned around the neighbor was nowhere to be seen. Unbelievable. ",411

"My kid (10 years old) earns $4.50 a week for doing school work on-time and without complaint and household chores. He's responsible for picking up palm tree limbs and coconuts from the lawn every week, and spraying weedkiller on the pavers. He can also earn extra for getting A's on tests or projects, and helping me with major chores like washing cars and cleaning up after trimming shrubs and trees. I told him that as soon as he can mow the lawn I'll give him $20 a week but so far I'm more excited about it than he is.

With the money he earns he is required to give $0.50 per week and save $1 per week for long term purchases (first car). The rest is his to spend on whatever he wants. A few weeks ago he complained about how little interest the bank paid and we told him that we invest. He asked if he could invest so now we're teaching him what it's all about, investment options, pros/cons, risk, etc. Once I think he's got somewhat of a clue we'll let him invest some money in one of our accounts and see what happens. I'm a bit worried though because the stock market isn't looking so great right now and I don't want him to have a bad experience that scares him from investing. ",247

Sheep- cool. Host family asks me to pick out my favorite lamb. Not knowing why, I point to my favorite, cute little speckled lamb. He seems nice, clueless, a little clumsy, lots of freckles. Maybe my spirit animal? Host family says great, thanks. Guy goes in, grabs lamb, throws it on a tarp laid out on the ground AND SLAUGHTERS IT IN FRONT OF ME. HE CUT A HOLE IN ITS CHEST WITH A POCKET KNIFE AND PUT HIS HAND IN AND PINCHED ITS AORTA UNTIL IT DIED. I couldn't speak.

"I have been married 15 years, had 4 kids, 2 with disabilities. I have been a stay at home mother many of those years. I have done all the diaper dutie, breastfed all our kids, homeschooled, sports, therapy including occupational, doctors appointments (there are a lot when you have two kids with disabilities), cooked all at home meals, planned all trips, paid bills, planned and executed all parties. Meanwhile my husband worked outside the home as a computer and copier repair tech, 9-5.

Here's where things get bad. He would come home tired, rightfully so. He had been working all day. He would then throw his clothes everywhere, scream at the kids and then say ""Where's my dinner?"" and then sit at the computer until bedtime. If I asked for help, ever I was met with exactly what you previously stated.   Now, don't get me wrong I understand the feeling of hunger and need what I don't understand is the need to never grant your spouse occasional grace. 

Take it from a couple that's been in counseling nearly 5 years. Staying at home with kids and then having a husband who only ask for food and sex is not a good marriage. People who work outside the home need to try understanding the psychological impact of staying at home not just the physical aspect. They need to make an effort to actually have in depth conversations with their spouse beyond food, cleaning and sex. No human needs to feel constantly under a microscope. Also, the at home spouse needs alone time for creative outlet or for fun on occasion. Also, please for the love of Bob, keep dating.

I realize I may get downvoted to Reddit hell for all this but hey, I figured I've actually lived it so why not say something.

BTW- I am still a stay at home parent, this includes online schooling for myself and I also work from home as an artist. It's just what works for us as parents that have kids with disabilities. Hope that all makes sense. ",136

"I was born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy type 2 and I'm 22 years old and I'll be lucky to make it to my thirties with the already shitty health issues I have now. I've almost died countless times and my health will only continue to get worse as time goes on. I'm wheelchair bound and have barely enough mobility to feed myself (even then it's still a struggle). My immune system is horrible leaving me vulnerable to illness that could easily kill me because I also have a weak respiratory system.

I learned to live with it and make the best of what I have. I was given one life to live and it might not be perfect, but fuck who's life is? I guess I could sit alone in a room crying to myself about life being cruel and unfair, but that won't do any good. I have to make my life whatever I want because I see people who have more means than I do complain about their lives and I'm here with a smile on my face and love in my heart. You have to love whatever it is you were given in your life no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. There are others who make do with less than me and they are happy, so why shouldn't I be? Life is too fucking long to be sad and worried about stuff you can't always control. So there's no reason why you shouldn't go out and make your life whatever you want it to be. 



You only have to accept that one day you, and everything around you, will one day cease to exist. It is unavoidable. Some people get overwhelmed with depression at that concept, but I use it as a motivation to make my life whatever I want because I have to. The mere fact that I was even gifted the ability to feel scared of death is nothing short of incredible. Life is a bittersweet thing full of moments that are both beautiful and tragic. Overall it is meant to be experienced while you can. Worrying about death is pointless. Think of it like this.

Why don't you try and earn a high score at Pacman! That might be fun, right? Except periodically, I'm gonna push a button that resets your score to zero. Just to fuck with you. 

Wait, you're just going to give up? Don't you still want to try and get a high score? No? 

You feel like the game is meaningless now since in the end, you're going to have zero points, and there's no way to win and there's no purpose. But the fact that you had the privilege to even play a game is amazing! It is fun and cool! Enjoy it while you can no matter what.

It bothers me when people scoff at him being an immature baby throwing tantrums. To me, that is EXACTLY how a budding Dark Side user would behave. They would be so overcome with all these negative emotions and would be unable to control them properly. Palpatine and Vader (presumably Snoke as well) have years of experience and meditation to really be able to use their negative emotions to make themselves truly powerful.

Even, unfortunately, when we were busy.  Sometimes people didn't want him to do it and would get frustrated, like one guy who ordered a long island and waited about ten or so minutes while the bartender did all kinds of tricks using the bottles and tin.  Finally the guy stood up on his bar stool and said, rather loud, ""Can I just have my fucking drink please?"".

The bartender laughed it off but later on said he was pissed and the guy was rude.  The guy actually got really embarrassed, was quiet while finishing his long island, paid and left.",105

"It's the 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th etc. characters in each string that have a 1 in bit 4 (0,1,2,3,4, so 5th from left if that is confusing). You've got a 32 bit register with an error in bit 28 (29th bit).

It's getting through pre-boot to NTLDR, so it's not the stack or any major CPU register, but I'd guess the problem is still within the standard x86 internal memory areas.

This kind of low level output uses DOS interrupts (21h) which are handed a pointer to the string location and starting point in memory. 

Don't know the exact procedure, but usually you would move the first piece of data into one of the internal memory blocks, where it is dealt with/transmitted/sent to IO chip a bit at a time, then load the next memory chunk, etc. 32 bit processors are called that because most of the data chunks it deals with are 32 bits.

It's that internal memory block that is probably hard coded into the DOS interrupt that is messed up. It's not part of the output chip (probably wouldn't break windows), or the main memory (wouldn't repeat like this), or one of the main registers/working locations in the chip (wouldn't load at all). 

Tl;dr: 32 bit CPU has 32 bit internal storage that pulls 32 bits of data at a time to do stuff with it. One of these is broken.

EDIT: The fucked up register MIGHT actually be in the GPU/VRAM bus. Specifically, wherever the CPU is sending those 32 bit packets.

EDIT 2: These same things happen within GPU, as well. Don't forget, video cards are their own little special purpose computers with processors, memory, IO chips, etc. 

**ONE MORE EDIT: Alright, there's a lot of opinions around here, so let's break it down a bit.**

As /u/chis101 pointed out, you've got a certain bit that is always 0 in some place that is storing ASCII characters.

This applies every 4th character, which is consistent with 32 bit storage that EVERY CHARACTER AND NOTHING ELSE is passing through (on this screen, at least).

&gt;**Theory 1: Main system RAM**  
* Hypothesis 1: Random bad ram locations   
* Evidence Against: wouldn't be every 32nd spot. Entire program NTLDR (windows loader) is in RAM, including this text which is pulled out of it.  
|  
* Hypothesis 2: 32 bit RAM input/output problem (in comm bus or input buffer etc.)  
* Evidence Against: Would affect EVERYTHING, including the running program. Nothing would run AT ALL  

|  

&gt;
**Theory 2: VRAM**  
* Hypothesis 1: Random bad locations  
* Evidence Against: wouldn't be every 32nd spot. Wouldn't consistently affect just this one thing.  
|  
* Hypothesis 2: 32 bit RAM input/output problem (in comm bus or input buffer etc.)  
*Evidence Against: would affect EVERYTHING ON SCREEN, since the actual pixel data is stored in VRAM for transmission to monitor after it is computed. You'd get garbage/noise everywhere.  

|  

&gt;
**Theory 3: CPU**  
* Hypothesis 1: Bad internal memory location  
* Evidence Against: not sure can be ruled out without more information, but would likely cause additional problems, probably including blue screens or failed BIOS POST/bootup   
|  
* Hypothesis 2: Input/output problem on GPU side  
*Evidence Against: might affect instructions sent to GPU or other things. Additional problems? Not sure it can be ruled out  

|  

&gt;
**Theory 4: Other Video Card**  
* Hypothesis 1: Bad internal GPU memory location  
* Evidence Against: not sure can be ruled out without more information, but would likely cause additional problems, probably including noise or other errors on screen. A dedicated ASCII -&gt; pixels chip/area could be the culprit if it has an exclusive memory register that is broken   
|  
* Hypothesis 2: Input/output problem on GPU  
*Evidence Against: Actually, I think this might be the most likely. Some video cards are known to experience pin connection problems after repeated heating cycles. Solder cracks, etc. The bus that carries data from PCI (data lines used by video card and others to connect to main board) is routed at some point into the GPU for processing. Perhaps the affected memory location/register is being fed through 32 pins, one of which is loose? I won't claim to have studied GPU design specifically like I have general x86 and x51 based microprocessor design, so I can't say for sure how the pins and internals would be set up. Having a dedicated ""data"" input array in addition to instructions and ""program"" information is pretty standard, though. There might actually be a set of pins or a chip/GPU portion specifically to deal with DOS based screens.  

If I've missed something, let me know. I'm sure I probably left at least 1-2 things out.

Say someone hands you a piece of paper. It's got four columns of words on it (4 on each row).

You call me up to give me the message, and you do it one line (4 words) at a time so I can write it down.

I'm an idiot, though, and I don't realize that the paper I'm using has a ton of little holes closer to the right the side (like right where I'm writing the 4th words).

Every fourth word, my pen can't write one of the letters (where the hole is). 

I give it to my friend to post to Reddit. To him, each of those little round holes looks like the letter o, so instead of:

They asked for pick up or delivery and I said delivery.  They asked for my number, then address, and I gave it to them then placed my order.  They said it would be there in about 45 minutes.

An hour and a half later my dad calls to see where our pizza is and they said we called in for carry out.  He asked why they asked for our address and why they said it would be here in 45 minutes when they thought we were coming to get it and they couldn't answer him.

I was just getting over my cocaine habit, being clean for a few years in fact. But they appeared on the 40th anniversary show of SNL, and I started doing it again. Now this. I don't really have the time or money to do it, but I have no choice. It's cocaine time.",224

As far as I could tell, I was emailing the same person I always did.  Signature blocks were the same, email address was the same, and they all speak broken English anyway.  The proforma invoices came in the proper format but at some point they injected a change of bank account details.  I saw the change and to double check I sent a Skype message to my contact (which didn't get answered) and emailed a separate account at the company, not replying to the original message.  They caught that one too and spoofed a confirmation.

It took weeks for us to work out what was going on because of the interception of messages.  By then the thieves (also based in Ivory Coast, I think) had closed the bank account and were gone.

""Lady Gaga"" is a character she created to make her entrance into pop music. ""Lady Gaga"" is a ""fame monster"", she feeds off of popularity, sex, money, attention, etc.

Everything she did as Lady Gaga (the singer) was intended to be a part of that character. What does showing up to an award show in a dress made of meat get you? Attention. Success. Fame monster is happy. Etc etc.

Her whole ""shtick"" was a performance, not just the songs. I think it was actually pretty good overall.

Thing is, now the public has no idea what her real name is, so she still goes by Lady Gaga even when not doing ""in character"" things. She's credited in American Horror Story (the show she won the globe for) as ""Lady Gaga"", but her acceptance speech was clearly very honest and not ""in character"".",268

"2) is necessary for several reasons.

One of the big ones is to avoid hiring discrimination. Suppose you have no one now who needs a handicapped spot. Let's say you can tell this to the government and get rid of half the handicapped spots. A position opens up and one of the qualified applicants is handicapped, and would require a handicapped spot. Suddenly hiring this person is going to result in major changes (and therefore costs) that would not be needed for anyone else. It becomes really easy for the employer to decide to skip over that candidate - either intentionally or subconsciously.

Similarly, an existing employee might suddenly need that spot. Injury, illness, etc. can happen without warning.

Here's the timeline:  

It was a little over two years ago, on a day much like today, and I was at home looking at Reddit...

First I laughed at the obvious fakery of [this /r/WTF post](http://imgur.com/a/vhEDy), grabbed a camera, and [made this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1if71e/my_friend_found_this_steal_of_a_deal_at_a_yard/cb3wbj0?context=3)    

An hour later, the Playstation /r/WTF post was removed.  

So [I made this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1ife7v/i_just_found_this_steal_of_a_deal_at_a_yard_sale/) and went offline for a bit.  

Unbeknownst to me, my post was removed about 45 minutes after I made it.  

I come back online something like 2 hours later and see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ifn7l/cant_believe_what_i_found_at_the_yard_sale/cb40rpa?context=3) at the top of the front page. The reposter had changed the title to imply they took the pictures themselves and altered the Imgur link to ""?gallery"" so my post didn't show up in the Other Discussions tab. At that moment, it was the most-upvoted /r/gaming post of all time.  

My GameCube and beer and everything were still in the hallway from when I made the album, so I dried my tears, [took this picture](http://imgur.com/wjYJQrC), and put it in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ifn7l/cant_believe_what_i_found_at_the_yard_sale/cb40rpa) on the stolen thread.

What probably happened to OP is that he was trying to book a ticket through a travel agency. The agency did a price check and offered him a price. He continued with the booking process and right as he clicked the last button to finalize the booking the agency did a second price check to verify that the original price is still valid. It found out that the price is altered and gave this pop-up window. There was no actual payment at this point. To the people asking: what are the odds that the price changed during the booking process i would say quite high. The agencies cache the price checks for some time so it is possible that the original price OP was offered was done some minutes before OP even when on the site. But since the change in price is really high i would consider it almost impossible that the price increased 6 times in lets say 15 minutes. This probably means that the cached prices in the agency database are never ""invalidated"", meaning that they should not be displayed after some amount of time. ",111

The snow was supposed to hit to the south of us, and in a show of magnanimous emergency management support, said plows left the city headed south before the forecast changed. Not that those 2 plows could have helped much anyway, but they weren't even in the same county as the actual ice/snow. 

Problem 2. ""Snow"" is an inaccurate term for what that shit was. First it rained. The rain froze and became black ice. Then a nasty slushy mix of ice and snow fell on top of that, and within 30 minutes we went from ""maybe we should consider going home early"" to ""Oh fuck the roads are totally impassable""

Problem 3. Terrain. This is not a flat area. Icy snowy bullshit on a flat surface road and the same icy snowy bullshit covering hilly areas have very different effects on transportation. Even if I did want to purchase chains for my tires - and frankly why the hell would I do that - I could still not have gotten home over the various hills between my office and my house.

Problem 4. People panic. We can handle tornadoes, we can handle hurricanes. But we do not have the resources or infrastructure to handle snow, so there is mass panic and everyone leaves at the same damn time to get home or get to the store for bread and milk, and suddenly the interstate is a parking lot and the city is utterly disabled for the greater part of a week.",119

&gt; A video of a firefighter jumping out of the window of a burning second-floor apartment in Jianli county, Hubei Province, has gone viral on Chinese social media. In the video, the firefighter is seen standing by the window attempting to arrange a line that he could grab to slide down, as the flames continue to grow intense. However, as his clothes caught fire, he was left with little option but to jump off the window holding on to the fire hose. Fortunately, he survived the incident, only suffering minor injuries to his hands.

Also, why the right side?

Simply because there is a hadith regarding how the Prophet pbuh used to sleep at night. Also, because if you are disabled or handicapped, a Muslim must pray.

If you can't stand, sit. Can't sit, sit on a chair. Basically the list is:

* Stand (normal)

* Sit (on your knees, folded legs) or sit (on a chair/stool)

* Lie down on your side (right side, lile how you will be buried)

* Lie on your back, feet towards kaaba

That is why you may see black people not considering a slightly overweight girl as ""too fat"" like a white person, and are willing or eager to date her if she is still pretty in the face/proportional (there is still a difference between pretty and ugly girls).

"There's also some chemistry to this. Myosin, the primary protein in muscle, starts to denature and coagulate at about 120F, which defines this temperature as the minimum temperature required to actually cook meat. Anything below that and your meat is raw. Beef fats render between about 130 and 140F, so if you want the flavor and juiciness of the fat to contribute you need to cook your meats in this range.

In terms of texture, this is related to collagen and actin coagulation, which happen at about 140F and 150F respectively. When these proteins start to coagulate, they basically tighten up a lot and squeeze out water and myoglobin (the ""blood"" in a rare steak is actually just myoglobin, another protein - no blood involved). If you're hitting these temperatures, your steak is starting to get tough and dry. Actin is much more responsible for the tightening than collagen, so that's the more unpleasant temperature to hit. And collagen will eventually basically just dissolve, and then gel to trigger the perception of ""moistness"", which is why you can stew meats to the point of tenderness even though the actual muscle tissue itself is firm and comparatively dry.

If we exclude the sear on the outside of the steak (flavor developed by Maillard reaction), then the primary flavoring agents of the meat are going to be esters, ethers, amides, and other very volatile molecules from the fat and muscle; these are fat-soluble (some water-soluble) molecules that are basically delivered to you by dissolving into the juices of the meat. THIS is where you notice the significant difference between corn-fed CAFO meat and a good Wagyu that's been raised properly - just like wine growing conditions change the types and relative concentrations of flavoring molecules in the grapes, different raising conditions of cattle have different effects on flavor. The problem with this is that they break down at comparatively low temperatures. Once you hit around 130-145F (depending on what publications you read), they start to break down, cross-link, or otherwise change. By the time you hit 160F, they've almost all broken down or otherwise been made inactive, and the majority of the moisture from the meat has been wrung out by coagulation of actin so there's nothing to carry flavor to you anyway.

So, the chemistry shows us that the best temperatures for tasting high-value eats is between about 130 and 140F. Once you hit well-done temperatures, the flavor molecules themselves are mostly fucked, and the ones that survived have been wrung out of the meat along with its juices. You can't tell the difference between different quality levels of the same cut of meat cooked to well-done because the molecules responsible for those differences are gone.",604

"Ryan O'Connor, the man 'behind' ripndip, is a [legitimate sellout](https://youtu.be/usASa1jaw3A?t=1381) and [woman abuser](http://i.imgur.com/fWQyWx5.png). In the video above, Ryan used to be apart of a skating troupe called the WKND BOYS. Long ago, These guys started an indy clothing brand for shits and giggles at a skate camp. They pursue it, and eventually start getting recognition and deals from places like Zumiez. One day, Ryan pulls out of the group, and cuts off contact with the rest of the boys. Since he registered ripndip, however, he keeps all of the groups work as his own intellectual property, and leaves his 'friends', who had helped him create and build the company, in the sticks. He even whitewashed the ripndip website by removing all team riders and creators, and listed himself as the ""sole creator"".

It's widely known in the skate scene that O'Connor and, by extension, ripndip, is a trash company that uses people for personal gain. Artists that are flaked out of commission by O'Connor have come to speak out against him. I get that some businesses can have a shady history, or are run by some morally questionable individuals, but Ryan O'Connor is the epitome of someone who fucked over everyone else to get to the top.

"A long time ago, I briefly worked at some stables. As I was grooming one of the horses one day I noticed she seemed to like having her back brushed, so I stopped brushing and started using my fingers to scritch her and give her shoulders and back a massage. She particularly seemed to enjoy me scritching the area her saddle usually sat. Her head went up and her lips started flapping as she moved around, trying to get my hands to all the itchy places on her back. Spent the next 15 or so minutes scritching and massaging the horse's back. I stayed til she calmed down a bit, then finished grooming her. Next day I did it again. I was her best friend during my short time there.

"In today's top story, Donald Trump has dropped out of the Republic Party Leadership race, explaining that he ""really thought everyone would get that it was a joke"".

Trump has stated that his feels ""disheartened"" at the positive response to his Presidential bid. 

""I just kept expecting someone to laugh,"" the real-estate mogul and television personality stated during a press conference. ""Like when I said global warming was made up by Chinese people. I kept staring at the audience, expecting a giggle - *something*! But they just looked at me like I serious. Some of them even nodded their heads in agreement!""

The unusual turn of events mirrors the story of Sarah Palin's ""Tea Party"" comedy troupe, which received unexpected political support from a group of confused elderly people who believed it to be a legitimate political party.

Trump has stated that he felt his joke should have been obvious given his past routines, which include insulting Rosie O'Donnell on a professional wrestling show and accusing the first black President of being born in Africa.

Trump stated ""I just don't understand how you can hear someone say John McCain isn't a war hero because he got captured and not understand that they're kidding."" 

The former Republican poll-leader concluded his speech by holding his head in his hands in total silence for three minutes, before finally announcing, ""Maybe you people just don't deserve a good President.""",214

By putting his own body on the seat, he's effectively blocking the bird's head from coming up. He's basically trying to hide the whole bird under the seat.

The idea of him intentionally forcing the bird's head up his own butt, which is what we're supposed to be so appalled by, never crossed anyone's mind back then. It's a product of our considerably more liberal sexual mores and fascination with everything anal, that it would even occur to us. Back then, this wouldn't have been a dirty cartoon. Nobody back then saw anything wrong with it. If that thought *had* crossed anyone's mind it would have been pulled by the censors.

"It's still a relevant point.  Vader has to beat Voldemort not just once, but repeatedly, since Voldemort has the capacity to escape death itself.

Unless we give Vader access to the Death Star.  That certainly hands him the win!

EDIT: Alright you fuckers.  I slept on it and came up with my final answer.  Vader is stronger, Voldemort wins through flexibility.  Hear me out.

The key factor in any contest between people of true power is *information*.  Voldemort's capacity to use Divination magic will give him a distinct advantage here, allowing him to pinpoint Vader's location.  Now, Vader may have the capacity to sense disturbances in the force, but these impressions are vague compared to, for example, remote viewing through a crystal ball.

Now we get into the interesting part.  With Voldemort having located Vader he has the opportunity to challenge him on his own terms. The first of those terms being ""Surrounded by Imperius cursed Stormtroopers and/or Death Eaters"".

Additionally, Voldemort is able to maintain significantly more flexibility and has the capacity to change terrain.  The goal here is not to knock Vader down with a single powerful effect, but to sap his concentration, because that is Voldemort's key advantage.  His spells can be 'fired and forgotten' while almost all of Vader's force powers require him to focus his mind and efforts.

Ice on the floor requiring Vader to move more carefully, a distraction.  Various monsters can be sent in waves to attack Vader, exhausting him (Imperiatus cursed Rancor? Yes please!).  Any time his concentration slips the goal is to strike with a *Cruciatus* curse, not Avada Kedavra. A little pain, or a loss of focus, again sapping Vader's strength.  Voldemort's ability to strike at range is a key element of this plan.  This is fait accompli if we can assume that Voldemort has the capacity to conjure up illusions.  A phantasm of Padme could easily enhance Vader's rage, causing him to become more dangerous yes, but that's what Appario spells are for.  Voldemort can retreat, advance, move across continents or rooms, all with very little effort or energy and even less time.

Using this method, Voldemort can keep Vader at arm's length, using shielding charms to block Force Choke (I mean really people, if the lightsaber can stop hexes we have to assume the shielding charm can block Force effects).

Now obviously this is incredibly frustrating for Vader fans, he is after all the stronger of the two! His actual capacity to dish out and receive damage is substantially higher than Voldemort's (neglecting Horcruxes).  But his power is delivered primarily through swordplay and Telekinesis.  Lightning may help, but we know that this creates an extraordinary drain on the Force Wielder, and thanks to Voldemort's ability to command the loyalty of potentially thousands, Vader cannot afford to expend that much effort.

Essentially, Vader is forced to chase Voldemort around while dogged by demons and dragons and former allies, haunted (literally) by phantasms and struggling over difficult terrain, all the while protecting himself from harm.

Eventually, he will fall.  Voldemort cannot be caught, and even should Vader prove to have more stamina, Voldemort's capacity to teleport (and keeping in mind that even whiney bitch wizards like Harry can move around a country with ease, we can probably assume Voldemort will quickly adapt to the scale of the Star Wars universe and start to teleport from ship to ship and ship to planet and back again in short order) keeps him at arm's length.

So after a long match, Voldemort is Muhammed Ali to Vader's Foreman.  The stronger Vader falls exhausted and wracked by agony to the floor.  At that point Voldemort moves close and reaches out a hand to him, becoming his new emperor and paving the way for a horrifying partnership that devastates the galaxy, the eternal reign of the Dark Lords enslaving all muggles and creating a ruling class of vicious lightsaber and wand wielding Force Wizards.",129

"In D&amp;D, you tend to roll a 20 sided dice to see if you succeed or fail. You need to roll over a certain number to succeed in that action. The certain number depends on the difficulty of that action.

So for example, if my warrior wants to attack a goblin, I'd roll my 1d20, add my warriors modifiers for strength and skills (+3 for strength, cuz he's strong, +2 for skill, cuz he's a low level). So if the dice lands on a 9, I'd add +3 and +2, for a total of 14. This goblin isn't very dexterious, and doesn't have heavy armor, so I only needed a 12 to succeed. The DM tells me I rolled high enough, so now I've successfully hit the goblin with my sword.

But, there's always a small chance that the fates are against/with you. If you roll a 1, it's usually an automatic failure. If you roll a 20, it's an automatic success, regardless of the modifiers like strength or level, etc. It's just one of those lucky/unlucky breaks the universe tends to throw your way.

So Oberon tried to do something he should have been able to handle, but he rolled a 1, meaning he automatically failed.",186

"**Negative bases:** Imagine the number 234. In base 10, this number is the equivalent of **2**\*10\^2 + **3**\*10\^1 + **4**\*10\^0. However, in base -10, for example, the number would be equivalent to 2\*(-10)\^2 + 3\*(-10)\^1 + 4\*(-10)\^0, which is 174 in base 10. And because a negative number to an even power is positive, and to an odd power is negative, the sign of the digit alternates depending on the parity of its decimal place.

**Fractional bases:** Sure. Consider 234 again, except this time in base one tenth. 2\*0.1\^2 + 3\*0.1\^1 + 4\*0.1\^0 becomes 4.32 in base 10. Because the base is a fraction, digits further to the right actually represent larger numbers, while digits to the left represent smaller numbers.

**(Edit) Disclaimer: In this case, fractional bases less than one cannot be represented on paper with normal numbers. This is a purely mathematical example.**

**Base 1:** Base 1 would be something like tally marks, with each tally being a digit, as explained by /u/PM_ME_INSIDER_INFO

**Base 0:** It is impossible to express anything other than the number 0 in base 0 because zero to the power of nothing will ever equal any number besides zero, so it cannot be done. Also because base 0 literally means there are 0 numerals to represent a number with.

And for fun, **imaginary bases:** 234 in base 10i is 2\*(10i)\^2 + 3\*(10i)\^1 + 4\*(10i)\^0 = -196 + 30i in base 10
