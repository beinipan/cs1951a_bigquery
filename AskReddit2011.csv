"&gt; The reason I started this debate was because I (completely mistakenly) presumed you were a left-liberal who refused to vote Democrat because they didn't match your principles exactly enough,

* If I were a left-liberal, there is still no way I would vote for Obama. 

&gt; Derivatives need to be regulated because of the massive leveraging they encourage,

* Would that massive leveraging occur, absent of government backing the derivatives themselves? 

&gt; and because their complexity makes risk-evaluation very difficult.

* Why would you purchase a derivative when you did not understand their risk-evaluation? 

&gt; I don't think you need the GSEs for a housing bubble. For example, in the Irish housing boom all that was involved were completely underegulated banks who kept giving out mortgages as long as house prices were rising

* ""[The debts of its big property developers](http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/03/michael-lewis-ireland-201103)—now generally defined as anyone who owed the bank more than 20 million euros—are being worked out behind closed doors. In exchange for helping the government to manage or liquidate their real-estate portfolios,...""

&gt; I associate economic liberalism with Reagan and Nixon, and during their time the gap between the rich and the poor widened considerably.

* Yea...Except the problem was that Reagan and Nixon both loved big government. They did not practice economic liberalism. Nixon completely de-paged the dollar from gold, to pay for the Vietnam War. I am glad you see that increasing the power of the central bank has widened the gap between the rich and the poor. ",1
"It's a big test to see which holds more weight in the minds of voters; the sheer stupidity of the GOP lineup, or how badly Obama has fucked up during his presidency. I'm not even talking about the economy, that's not 100% on him, I'm talking about things like Operation Fast &amp; Furious.",1
"I am the exact same way as you, (socially liberal, financially conservative), but I don't believe in the balanced budget amendment.

The reasons why:

Debt is not necessarily bad.  It provides a risk-free source of income for many people around the world.  As long as the US government continues to pay off their notes, the U.S. dollar becomes the standard default currency of the world.  

Also, in theory, if you inject debt money into the country, the nation should then use that money to increase GDP to a portion where the taxes collected on the debt produced increase should cover the debt payments.  For example, let's say the U.S. gives $1 trillion to America.  This would probably result in the GDP raised by $200 billion (pure fucking guess BTW).  The effective tax rate is approximately 20%.  So, the nation gets 20% of $200 billion, or $40 billion.  The interest on the $1 trillion dollars would be 4%, or $40 billion.  Obviously, this ignores crowding out, misaligned incentives, poor redistribution of wealth, and so forth, but that's the general gist of it.

Also, government revenues wax and wane, and in bad times, tax revenues would fall.  This would essentially mean that it bad times, the government would have to layoff workers and reduce spending at the time when the economy needs it the most.  

Finally, who would decide what to cut or how to spend?  If the budget is not balanced, who gets to decide?  What if the legislature and executive branch can't product a budget - does the Supreme Court get involved to rule on the budget?  The courts can overrule laws and actions that violate an amendment.  Republicans can purposely delay any bill, know that it would end up in the judiciaries hands.  And since the Supreme Court is conservative, it helps the Republicans out - all because the Bushes and Reagan nominated more justices than Clinton and Obama.",3

"Let me respond to three points here in particular:
""What strange conclusions am I coming to?"" I wasn't saying you were concluding them, but that somebody could. That line of reasoning goes anywhere.

""The third premise is not proven though."" This is where it gets very complex, and you will have to read some articles, books, or at least watch that video from Dr. Craig that I linked earlier. There is a lot of evidence and it weighs in favour of the most reasonable position being the real resurrection of Jesus. I just can't fit the details in the space. My point in mentioning it there (but not expanding the point) was to emphasize that there is an order in which it is possible to believe in Christianity that is not circular.

""Are you saying it's ok for christianity that something greater than god can exist?"" No. I'm saying that you could believe something greater than god *might* exist, and then come to believe Christianity later, and then realize nothing does after reading the Bible (which you would then accept). For comparison, suppose I wanted to prove that Barack Obama is an American citizen. I might not start by assuming he's legitimately the president of the US if I were arguing with somebody who thought that not being a citizen undermined his presidency. I might start by talking only about the birth of ""citizen Obama"" and then once his credibility was established (that his whole career isn't one massive fraud), we could move onto other conclusions further into the details that he is in fact the legitimate president, etc.

Since this is Reddit, I could also give a computer science explanation. How to boot-up a Christian:
- A Christian's BIOS is the basic gospel: ""I'm a sinner and Jesus died for my sins"". Like any good BIOS it also points to where the operating system is stored.
- A Christian's operating system is stored in the Bible. And a Christian will often have to access system files there to verify many points of theology, such as the supremacy of God above all else in existence.
- If the operating system ends up corrupted, you could clear out all the theology, reinstall a clean copy of the Bible from good manuscripts (the old, Greek and Hebrew ones), and reboot from the BIOS, which is still working.

Also, Christians can believe things that contradict the tenets of Christianity and still go to heaven, etc. [John 9](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+9&amp;version=NIV) tells the story of a man healed from blindness who admits about Jesus, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!” (9:25). Jesus not being a sinner is pretty basic, but most theologians agree this man's faith was enough, even though he didn't know that part.

My point is that Christianity is complex, and if you are looking for me to provide an argument that jumps you straight to the end, you won't find it. What you will find is a series of separate arguments that may or may not convince you to get that BIOS flash (gospel) that starts the whole ball rolling. I apologize if you happen to not be computer-saavy and this computer metaphor makes no sense.",2
"I didn't vote for him in the last election but he is the perfect example of what politicians should be like

I also heavily disagree with our current prime minister on many things, but, days before Layton died, Prime Minister Harper called him and offered him a state funeral. This is a really big deal as these are usually reserved for prime ministers and governors-general and the last time a state funeral was given to someone who normally would not automatically qualify for one was in 1867 and thats the only other time this has happened. There was a state funeral attended by just about every major politician and former prominent NDP leader... Stephen Lewis delivered the eulogy (he's big with African charities but I don't know if his name is recognizable outside canada) and he is very similar in his charitability, eloquence, and kindness

What is unfortunate is that, because the numbers of his party were usually smaller, there are not a ton of people ready to replace him and the two that seem likely to contend for leadership race are nowhere near jack layton. It would be like replacing Obama with Biden... its just not the same.

Am I the only person who thought of Obama?,39
"Are they really gonna ask about this? Basically Obama wanted some sort of government-run insurance plan people could buy into, but what happened was a bill where people have to buy private insurance if they don't have it through work or medicare/medicaid. At the same time, everyone under the poverty line will be eligible for government health insurance. Insurance companies are also restricted in declining coverage due to existing conditions.

However, two appeals courts have struck down the provision requiring people to buy private insurance, and the Supreme Court will decide definitively soon.

I can't imagine how much more they'd want you to know. In my experience medical school doesn't care too much about that kind of thing... I know a guy who did very well at medical school but missed a question at one point where he had to know if Cincinnati was east or west of the Mississippi (due to something about the disease in question). He didn't know so he missed the question. But... in general he did very well despite having very little non-medical knowledge.",1

Speaking for myself, the town halls* still feel few and far between -- I'm far more likely to believe any given Congressperson is in any one of their houses on vacation or playing golf with lobbyists. Hell, when town halls DO take place, it seems that there is a growing push by politicians to IGNORE constituents and continue doing whatever the hell they want. Wisconsin is a great example of that.

Besides the fact that this is terrible misuse of ERs, ER bills are some of the highest and most ridiculous medical bills you will get for primary care.

Well they won't, and they'll go into debt, and they'll owe the money, but until they pay it back the hospital can't operate if it isn't paid, so who picks up the balance? The American Taxpayers. So uninsured people drain taxpayer money and potentially add to our debt, and enacting a single payer system would actually help cut the deficit. In fact the Obama health care reform legislation was scored by the Congressional Budget Office to reduce the debt, not add to it. I believe the version of the bill that had the public option in it was also scored by the CBO to reduce the deficit. ",46

The Europeans and their descendants had only a few advantages over the ""natives""  ... steel, guns and gunpowder, and their immune systems.  They weren't any smarter, were often less philosophical, having just left Europe so they could read their Bible in their own language ... which had been a crime for a thousand years, and probably not as clean. 

Disease killed a lot of natives ... scarlet fever, a variety of influenza strains, and diseases like the measles, mumps and polio.  War and displacing them from their land had a significant toll.  

I don't have the statistics handy, but most straight-line native Americans died from diseases, not from war, although a significant percentage were killed.  Many took the ""if you can't beat them, join them"" approach and shacked up with a European descendant.  A lot did.

**The European descendants had sex with the natives and the vast majority of present-day Americans are descendants of the native Americans.**  I am.  You probably are too.

We are probably closer to mutts.

Anyway, the funny thing is that the descendants of Europeans still have the attitude that this country is their birth right.  They hardly ever claim their Native American heritage ... except when they find out they can get a tribal check from a casino-rich tribe.  The other thing these folks like to do is complain about ""Mexicans"" ... who, in their minds, have no right to be here ... or to the land that their ancestors lived on for 14,000 years before the ""I, Me, Me, Mine"" Europeans showed up and stole it from them.",1

"And by ""some"" you mean ""the vast majority""? I've been talking generalisations naturally. I'm not suggesting there's only every two possible opinions and no room in the middle.

Of course there's a spectrum, but you're somewhat demonstrating the point I'm making by taking a single issue as the only one that really matters above all others: that's the perception that because republicans favour increasing military spending - that's most likely to get your job safe. As I said: short game vs long game. Why is everything down to one issue? Because people are failing to look beyond the immediate future and all the stuff that matters long/medium term or hell, short term even. Military spending is bankrupting your country by the way, I think it was Eisenhower who warned about exactly the situation you're in currently (speech on ""military industrial complex""). But hey, there's no opportunity for risk because the risks of losing a job are so high in your country (and the unemployment rate is pretty high).

The stance that the republicans (and to be clear I mean the party, not anyone who happens to vote for them) are catering to the top 1 or 2% and shitting on everyone else. There's very little ability to argue that the party willing to do whatever it takes to ensure the richest 1-2% got an extension of tax cuts.

There's the party then there's the voters for the party. I'm not suggesting they're the same thing, I thought that was clear. But the overwhelming favour of the party is definitely skewed to the richest few percent. That it gets 50% +- whatever of the vote shows that people are quite happy to trade getting an ever more shitty deal for some short sighted issue (""I don't want gays to have rights"", ""I don't like taxes"", ""Obama's the anti-christ"" etc).

"Obama is incumbent, and that is always a huge advantage.  The Democrats will not put someone else as the front-runner.

On the Republican side, each of the candidates have huge issues.  While the idea of ""elect a Republican, any Republican"" might attract a large number of conservative votes, the specific choice of front-runner will determine whether anyone on the fence would vote for him.  I can't think of any of the Republican candidates who will garner more independent voters than Obama will.

"People: like every other country, a mix of good and bad, dumb and smart, ignorant and educated. Statistically fatness is common.

Geography: awe-inspiring, varied, Grand Canyon, wide open spaces

Nature: Unlike Europe, America still has a ton of untouched nature, huge sections are forested and there are still bears everywhere. Great for hiking.

Beer: Tends to be very light and water. Some good mico-brews started by German immigrants though.

Wine: Excellent wineries in California, the perfect climate for wines. 

Food: To most people American food = fast food. I think what America brought to the global food culture is the factory method of food production. 

Sports: American sports and the culture around them are completely unique, for example american football is considered the greatest sport in the world by americans and nobody else, they care about amateur/college sports, americans tend to talk/watch/understand sports in terms of statistics. They don't like free-flowing games, they prefer start-stop affairs. Once you grow up with the american football framework for sports (start-stop, mechanical, standardized plays, statistics) you tend to be unable to like soccer generally, and vice versa. Although I hear soccer is growing there.

Politics: far more right wing than anything in the rest of the western world. Anywhere in Europe, Obama would be labelled a conservative. In America he is far-left wing socialist. Also patriotism plays a huge part in American politics unlike here, labelling something as un-American is a surefire way to win a debate in the US.

Cars: Tend to be boxy, big, gas-guzzling and steer like a barge. At least that was the historic trend, recently more and more of the American car companies are making sleek, small and great handling cars.

Religion: America is by far the biggest outlier among western countries when it comes to religion, its kind of scary. That evolution is seen as controversial in the year 2011 is scary as well. Bible Belt is scary. Thankfully the coastal areas are growing more and more non-religious so a good trend.

Architecture: Chicago is hugely influential in the world of architecture and gave rise to many modern styles. Wright is studied and respected around the world. 

Regions: Most Europeans really do split America into three parts: New York (atlantic coast), Texas (middle America) and California (pacific coast). We assume New York is similar to us, Texas is baffling and to be mocked, California is Hollywood and hippies. Every other state is put into these three moulds.

Isolation: Americans are self-centered and isolated culturally. To Europeans, who are so used to international interactions, this seems anti-social and ignorant/arrogant. But really its impossible to blame Americans for living in a isolated cultural bubble, they are geographically isolated and the country is freaking huge. It's hard for Europeans to grasp that you could drive non-stop in a straight line for days and still be in the same country. 

Innovation: Americans really are the most entreprenurial and innovative people on the planet. I think it may be because its such a young country, maybe because there is still optimism of the undiscovered frontier, so something i don't know. All I know is that America definitely has an youthful optimism which leads them to try the un-conventional and this leads to innovative ways of thinking.

History: I don't think Americans quite understand how young of a country they live in. Americans think of ancient history as 400 years ago, to Europeans we can walk around our town and see monuments, buildings and fountains older than that. This lack of historical perspective causes many Americans to get scared easily as they see everything as a huge threat to their countries existence. 

Healthcare: Seriously fucked up from what I see, but maybe I'm wrong on this I've never been through the US healthcare system myself.

TV and Movies: Hands down the best in the world. 

Music: Amazing music, although country music sucks ass imo.

"That's the illusion: that we're all so civilized now. But the fact is: the political landscape has never changed—not since the time of Macchiavelli.

Wars are still launched on false pretexts, governments still lie to their citizens, and Heads of State are still assassinated.

Look at Ukrainia's President, Viktor Yushchenko. He was poisoned with dioxin, and it destroyed his face. See him here:

http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2004/12/05/yushchenko3_wideweb__430x287.jpg

This happened in 2004.

So, yes, Heads of State are still being poisoned. Presidents are still be deposed by foreign powers, silent coups are still occurring left and right around the world.

In 2007, the Freedom of Information Act finally forced the CIA to release documents which detailed their assassinations of Congo leader Patrice Lumumba, Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic's Rafael Trullijo. As well as their attempts on Castro's life. 

“Killing a political leader whose burgeoning career is a clear and present danger to the cause of freedom may be held necessary,” a CIA instructional guide on assassination explains.

Obama's administration made news worldwide when they declared the right to assassinate anyone in any part of the world. It was a stance that was even more militant than George Bush's.

So it's kind of hard to argue that ""Assassinations have stopped"" at a time when the government is saying, ""We're assassinating who we want, when we want. Fuck you.""

Here's an article on it from Slate, entitled, ""Obama Argues His Assassination Program Is A State Secret"": http://www.salon.com/2010/09/25/secrecy_7/

"&gt;It's just not all Muslims, like some people assume. 

Since you seem to want someone to ""invalidate"" your post, let me nitpick at the word ""just."" These people aren't ""just"" confused over whether it's *some* or *all* Muslims who want Sharia law. They're also confused about 

* Whether there are a significant number of such people altogether 

* Whether this Sharia-law plan has some sort of broad support from liberals, supporters of multiculturalism, Democrats, President Obama, etc. 

* Whether there is any actual danger that Sharia law will gain a foothold in our legal system, or whether Sharia law proponents should be laughed off as kooks. 

In short, I think you've vastly understated the confusion at play here.

"He's done a significant job toward ending the War in Iraq. You can't just take everyone out all at once, it's simply not realistic. As far as Afghanistan, I supported that war and think it should've gotten this attention 9+ years ago. Maybe it's better that we abandon it, but if it was worthwhile once then it's worthwhile to finish.

Libya is not a war, yet. We can argue the semantics of military action versus all-out war all day long but a few thousand missiles to try to protect a civilian revolution against a dictator is a far cry from several hundred thousand troops occupying, destroying, and rebuilding a nation.

Yes, Obama had a majority in Congress but all that means is the label of Democrat. The Republicans vote as a block, but the Democrats do not. They squabbled and pussied out for a year over the health care bill and it ended up in shambles. That said, however, what did manage to pass is an important piece of legislation. Yeah there's no public option, but it added millions of Americans to the healthcare system and changed the rules about refusing coverage. And best of all it actually saves money. Question it all you want but the budget already confirms it even before it's fully implemented.

I completely agree on his promises about marijuana and the DEA, although I doubt he honestly has much power over the situation. I think that he'd legalize it if he thought it wasn't political suicide. Maybe in the second term (he may not deserve it but seriously who the fuck are the Republicans going to run that can beat him?).

You and I may support Bradley Manning but I still think that is a fringe opinion that not even Obama would agree with. Transparency sure (and Obama has done some important steps toward transparency even if it's not total) but no American president is going to stand with a military whistleblower. The only thing that's going to save Bradley Manning is massive public outcry and some DAMNING releases from WikiLeaks.

To say he is as bad as Bush is moronic though. He's not great, but significantly better at running this behemoth of a country than anyone I've seen in my lifetime. I recognize that no one capable of getting elected is ever going to represent my radical (sensible) interests but he's pretty damn close. I'll vote for him again and hope for less political concerns in his second term.",2

"Situations change, just because you feel you can promise something before an election does not mean it's a promise you can fulfil two or three years down the line. For example, one of the things high on the Obama agenda was universal healthcare, but if he had tried to implement it now he probably wouldn't get it to pass.

Should our politicians behave the same way under all circumstances? Absolutely not. Having somebody who's adaptable and changes decisions based on the evidence currently at hand is making a much more informed decision, and likely one that will be more effective in performing the job at hand. Nobody wants to be in Afganistan, but we're there now, and we have a duty to build the nation to a point of self-sustainability and bring out from being a failed state (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state).

How small does the issue go? Do you take EVERY promise a politician makes and use it as evidence of lying? Compromise is part of the political system, and in making concessions to get aspects which you think are a higher priority passed seems like a good idea to me, else nobody gets what they want, and nothing gets done. Sure, you're priorities might differ from his, but then not everybody is going to agree with you - they might view issue x higher than issue y, and at a push, will give up issue y entirely so long as x gets passed. You might think issue y is hugely important, but this is the definition of opinions - sometimes they're different!

I think people need to give politicians more credit than they get. I'm not saying they're benevolent (in fact some are quite incompetant), but the compromises struck sometimes rely on secrecy because otherwise they could not be agreed upon. Explicitly stating you have foregone y to get issue x is probably going to annoy a lot of people, and the others who have compromised on issue x to get issue z aren't going to shout to the high hills about it either I'd imagine.

Also, use Hanlon's razor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) judiciously when trying to figure out a politicians behaviour. Cut them some slack, they are human too.

TL;DR - Politicians need to compromise based on a situation. Sometimes this isn't portrayed in the media.

The problem with having your governing body regulate the news is that they can then start censoring things that they don't like. Slowly at first, but before you know it you could easily have a corrupt government with a stranglehold on what people see and hear. The Brits are struggling with this right now, and despite the despicable actions of NoW, they still realize that a government-run organization with the purpose of regulating the news isn't the correct solution.",1
"Lots of reasons:

-the Entitlement Class (people on welfare, in section 8 housing, medicaid, etc.) are sucking up more money than they are producing and this class of people is growing fast.
-Obama issued a moratorium on offshore drilling effectively impeding our ability to compete with OPEC nations with what little oil comes from the gulf.
-Liberals/leftists have been blocking drilling in known deposits in the US.  This has kept us from competing with OPEC nations.
-Takes gas to produce food.  Gas goes up and everyone on the chain feels it.
-No salary increase because you're not in a Public Union.  Public Unions have contracts to increase their salary and decrease the number of hours per year they work created thru collective bargaining agreements.  It's another branch on the Entitlement Class tree that is killing our country.
-We have a President that supports all of this, a Senate whose majority supports this, and a congress too pussy to do something about it.

"The Pauls are about removing the powers of the federal government that aren't explicitly stated in the Constitution. They're all about states' rights.

Brief overview:
Paul's **stance on abortion does suck**. But he doesn't want a federal mandate on outlawing abortion, he just thinks that each state should take it upon themselves to decide the legality of abortion.

Paul does **oppose the USA PATRIOT Act** which is huge in my opinion.

Paul wants to **end the Federal Department of Education and allow state and local governments to take control over education**. This is all a part of Paul's small government/small budget plan.

Paul **opposes energy subsidies** and is **for providing tax breaks on alternative energy**.

ersonally, I've been against Obama's health care plan and against for-profit health insurance. I think a single payer system would honestly be for the best, but since that likely won't happen in the US anytime soon I think Paul's stance on healthcare is... typical. He doesn't just simply want to revert Obama's health care plan but he wants to **repeal the HMO Act of 1973**.

Paul's stance on illegal immigration, I believe in. I think that **a nation should protect its borders** and I think that **giving citizenship to kids born to illegal immigrants is ridiculous**. With that said, illegal immigration isn't going to end because of a border fence, there needs to be some sort of US-Mexico alliance to figure out this problem (which is just another symptom of our failed drug war).

Paul is **against same-sex marraige**, but thinks it should be up to **each state to decide**.

When it's all said and done I disagree with Paul about same-sex marriage, but he salvages his attitude by allowing each state to vote on whether or not they should legalize it or not. And I disagree with him on abortion to an extent. I don't think abortion should be free and open for everyone, but I think there should be concessions made in some cases (in the case of victims of rape/incest, if the baby is going to have some sort of malady (like mental retardation and other genetic orders), or when the mother could be harmed if the baby is to be carried to full term and birthed). Furthermore, I would go as far to give tax credits to those who decide to sterilize. ",2
"&gt;There's a difference between a net worth of $100k and a net worth of BILLIONS. There's a damn big difference.

That's my point. I was not talking about taxes at all. It's not reasonable to assume that the average person can be upwardly mobile to the extent that they can become a billionaire, if they work hard. It *is* reasonable to expect that the average hard-working person, *who makes good choices*, can provide themselves with a decent, middle-class existence. When I say hard-working, I don't mean someone who works two minimum-wage jobs because they became addicted to heroin as a teen and ended up in prison. Sure, they work hard, but they made awful choices. If people truly understood the consequences of their actions, there would be much less partying and studying of art history in college. No one should expect that they can become successful by doing whatever they want all the time.

&gt;this assumes that money is the end goal in life and every other desire should be shuffled aside

Well, you mentioned upward mobility. Upward mobility has to do with working your way into a higher socio-economic class. That deals with income. If we're talking quality of life, it's a different matter. Pretty much anyone can pay a couple thousand dollars for the training necessary to become an English teacher in South East Asia, if they want to live a comfortable life. But most people don't *want* to do that, so instead the choose to suffer in a job market where they can't compete. I'm not saying that things are perfect, but people who have worked hard and made the right choices are in a lot better shape than those who haven't.

&gt;And why are you excluding the poor?

Because you mentioned the middle-class, and because there's many more variables involved. Frankly, most people just aren't willing to do what it takes to succeed, or they have a broken family. The solutions to these problems aren't government solutions, which is why I haven't discussed the issue. Look at Chinese immigrants. The overwhelming majority of them enter the US living under the poverty line, yet they tend to extricate themselves from poverty within a generation. 

&gt;On the contrary, public schools are failing in a massive way and are only getting worse.

I agree that public schools are failing massively. My point was that *some* people who attend them succeed, so *obviously* it's not impossible. Also, I don't think the solution is to throw more money at them. Ultimately, public schools fail because they are unable to get students to take responsibility for their own education. [Here's](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/200909/seven-sins-our-system-forced-education) an interesting article about the shortcomings of our public school system.

&gt;Bull shit. You think only 4% of people really want to be upwardly mobile? Only 4% of people know how to work hard? Only 4% of people make the right career choices? Simple fact is a lot of the time it's literally impossible to get rich.

Well I used $100k as an extreme example, to make a stronger point. But the fact of the matter is that everyone is not supposed to get rich. Do you really think everyone should be rich? I think not. Really, what you and I care about is that hard-working people can have a decent middle-class existence. Sure, it's hard for a lot of people to do that. That's the problem, not that everyone won't end up wealthy. But, using my example, the majority of people who work hard enough to become engineers (and choose the ""correct"" engineering field) will be able to make $100k/year at some point in their careers. That's true and there's no reason to deny it.

&gt;On global man-made climate change.

Honestly, I don't have an opinion on this issue. I'm not one to accept what others tell me without checking it out myself (it seems fairly unscientific to me to do so), and I simply haven't looked into the issue amply to form a strong opinion. [These](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientists_opposing_the_mainstream_scientific_assessment_of_global_warming) guys disagree with the consensus, and they all know more about the issue than me, or you. So, I'm not saying you're wrong. But, **more importantly** , the existence of a scientific consensus does not mean that there should be a consensus on political policy. The issue of global (man-made) climate change is extremely complex. There's no *obvious* legislation to be written here.

&gt;Not as many, and not as loud.

Anti-trade activists were pretty loud at the G20 summit. Really though, who cares? A minority of extremists don't undermine the credibility of a large group. Do you think Islam is a hateful religion, just because of the Taliban? Do you think liberals are hateful and insane because of people like Bill Ayers? Of course not. You're not engaging in constructive discussion by marginalizing an already marginalized minority. The majority of conservatives don't condone the behavior of those extremists that you've been addressing thus far. There, now you can move on to addressing the ideas of the peaceful, knowledge-seeking majority.

&gt;the fuck? By what metric is it legitimate and intellectually valid to claim that Obama was born in Kenya? Or to suggest that we shoot illegal immigrants like pigs? Or to put pictures of crosshairs on images of our political opponents?

Do the majority of conservatives condone this behavior? No. End of story. Until you recognize that most conservatives are not hateful or ignorant, realize that you're seeing the world through biased eyes. You're not thinking rationally. Have you considered that as a possibility? Please do, for the sake of intelligent discussion. Just think, as a liberal you're obviously going to notice the worst of behavior by conservatives, just like conservatives notice the worst of behavior by liberals (ex. armed Black Panthers guarding Philly voting booths in '08 and influencing votes). C'mon man, I'm not even conservative and I notice your tainted vision.

At least among people not living in the woods with AKs 'round their shoulders. There has also been a universal consensus among big business post-stimulus that Obama is against them.

The same guy who would, were it not near-impossible in a nation essentially controlled by corporate interest, make healthcare a universal right for citizens? Who had to settle for a 'forced' mandate as the best alternative to that dream?


The vast majority of you who didn't go out to vote against the party exploiting all that granny-killing muslim nonsense last November, your justifications are built upon ignorance. On misinformation, skewed analysis and the regurgitated bile of the most vocal in your increasingly-deprived media. 

Every single one of your bullet points can be addressed pretty easily by pointing to facts. You may wish to ignore the political process and the realities of Washington to enforce your sanctimonious scorn, but it remains the case that the candidate to whom you direct your misplaced criticisms is beholden to those realities. 

And those realities will only become more powerful, more corrupt, and more centred around corporate interests, if people like you keep turning your heads in misguided protest to perceived slights only a minute's further research would render unjustified. 

You've got a lot of assholes in American politics. They're exclusive not to one party but to one principle: profit over people. It is that principle that guided a Republican opposition through the last two years of blanket intransigence; it is that principle that guides Scott Walker in Wisconsin and the corporate lobbyists and House Republicans in Washington through their plans to attack the bottom 95% now. Perhaps it's time people like you stop using those tissues to wipe unjustified tears from your eyes and start using them to clean up your politics.",6
"Currency and equities trader here, with economics training. First of all, this is commodities inflation brought on by credit expansion, not increased demand and a couple of earthquakes. What's more, everyone knew it was coming. Just seeing you say otherwise makes me want to facepalm or something. :(

Keep banging that drum though, thinking that having effective social and welfare policies are at all related to having a regulated quasi-socialist/fascist *economy*.

I mean, depending on which ones you want to point to ... it's not like Scandanavian countries have no minimum wage, lower barriers to open a business than an American has to getting a fishing license, or privatized pensions and social security, depending on the country. Plus much, much more. 

It's just a *coincidence* those nations, or Canada or Australia make enough national profit to sink it back into their social programs. /sarcasm

Think of it this way. Even using [a US conservative ranking from Heritage.org](http://www.heritage.org/index/Ranking), which is essentially a GOP mouthpiece organization really, the US and the Netherlands are very, *very* close in ""economic freedom"". Places like Denmark, Canada, and Australia are actually ""more free"" than the US, economically. 

Now, to keep things in context, can you imagine how much lower the barriers to entry and restriction on trade have to be to put the US and Denmark or the Netherlands even in the same ballpark when you consider it's a US conservative group that *does* factor in income taxation? It's going to have to be a market utopia damn near just to even be in the same ballpark (half-kidding of course, but the point remains). 

What nations like Canada, Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, Switzerland, New Zealand, et. al. have in common is that they are highly efficient and free market economies, which increase ""profit"" so to speak. Not many people think of it that way, because of what ""profits"" are spent on social-program-wise ... but they should. Especially in the US. People like you need to stop effectively supporting the GOP line that these other places some socialist shithole, because nothing could be further from the truth. 

This is the uncomfortable, and little understood truth: ""Economies"" and ""welfare states"" are not one and the same. There are very different ways to run both, and only one method, to date, has shown remote success at mixing the two. US progressives should stop listening to stupid corporatist Democrats and instead *really* look to Canada, Australia, Netherlands and Denmarks of the world on how to get the best safety net. It's by increasing capital, of course. How do we do that? By decreasing barriers to entry and increasing market freedoms of course. Increase market freedoms, act like Canada or Denmark, and you can have your social democracy Americans ... if the citizenry can be convinced to spend the sudden capital influx in that manner.

... and here is the longer and more in depth argument to be made where I probably should have stopped after reading the respondent say, ""The above post and all it's facts may be true but ... "" ;)

The first is a holdover from the original constitution. There is still a debate over states rights vs federal government, and who gets to tax who has been fought over for nearly two centuries.

They ~~bribe~~ contribute to the campaigns of other wealthy politicians whom they know will protect their corporate or private wealth. Not everyone in America thinks this way, but the richest are willing to spend money to get their politicians elected to keep them rich. 

I know that in England, for example, their parliamentary system means they can only spend a certain amount of money and have a limited campaign time, neither applies in America sadly. Certain Republicans have stated since Obama got elected, that their primary goal is making sure he is a one term president. Nowadays, presidents have to start campaigning 2 years before the election.

"As you said, the internet you frequent leans left, as does Reddit, so of course the majority of these responses will lean left. What bothers me about some of these responses is that they refuse to accept that even an idea they disagree with is a valid thought. I consider myself an average Republican voter, and therefore disagree with many of the policies of the left, but I don't think people who hold those views are vile, disgusting animals. They just have a different viewpoint. They can argue and debate those opinions. I don't agree with them, but the left political format is a valid ideology, just as the right is.

As a mainstream Republican, I support a lower role of the federal government, believing rather that government on a more local level can better reflect and respond my community's needs. That said, I also understand that the federal government has a necessary role in American life (border security, defense, infrastructure, food/safety/financial regulations).

I attend church, I'm pro-life and support same-sex marriage. My dad, one of the most conservative people I know, supported the auto company bailouts from the late Bush and early Obama Administration, because he thinks GM should always have a place in America.

If you want an honest, ungarnished view of American conservative thought, check out The Weekly Standard, The Daily Caller or any of Andrew Breitbart's websites. I'm also a fan of the Hot Air blog, with the conservative opinions on that site ranging from more traditional to more moderate.

The American Republican Party has a wide range of views that, just like the left has (or any group in the history of mankind), varying degrees of support and opposition within itself.

The awful thing about politics is that people tend to demonize others who don't think the same as them, while at the same time celebrating diversity and talking about how accepting of other beliefs they are.

"overwhelmingly, government subsidies drive costs up. look at anything when costs skyrocket, and you'll discover that the government has interfered with normal market decisions. 

when did higher education costs begin their dramatic increase? when the government backed private student loans. when did the housing bubble begin? when the government mandated that 30% of all mortgages must be given to low-income borrowers and those risky loans were backed with government guarantees (by 2007, in fact, laws required that 55% of all mortgages had to be given to below-median-income borrowers). medicine is no exception to this general pattern. 

&gt;Everyone keeps railing on about ""Obamacare"" but I haven't seen any evidence that what is proposed should result in higher premiums or costs.

You haven't been looking too hard. 

&gt;Remember when the President promised that Obamacare would reduce the cost of health insurance? “Under [our] plan, if you like your current health insurance, nothing changes, except your costs will go down by as much as $2,500 per year,” said Obama in 2008. The law, like Romneycare in Massachusetts, would magically eliminate the mythical “free-rider problem” by massively subsidizing health spending for the lower middle class.

&gt;Well, the Office of the Actuary in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently put out its annual projections of national health care spending. **And, contrary to the President, the actuaries find that Obamacare will dramatically increase the near-term growth rate of health care costs. In 2014, the actuaries find that growth in the net cost of health insurance will increase by nearly 14 percent, compared to 3.5% if PPACA had never passed.** The growth rate of private insurance costs will rise to 9.4 percent, from 5.0 percent under prior law: an 88% increase.

"I'm assuming by your comment that if you were paying $3.21 for gas the rest would be less of an issue for you.

You're paying that much for gas because for decades pro-environmentalist Democrats have opposed any nuclear power plants in the United States as well as erecting as many barriers as possible to slow down the production of coal, oil, and natural gas in this country.  As a direct consequence, energy prices were destined to go up eventually even with the best government regulations.

As for the rest, it's the result of an economic recession which was caused by both Democrats and Republicans getting together and passing bad banking deregulation in the 90s.  It's also a consequence of both parties not being serious enough about the national debt in the 00s, which necessitated massive increased in the money supply and low interest rates in order prop up the system.  The result of all this excess money was risky real estate speculation.

Finally, inaction on the issue of national health care in this country since the 1970s has resulting in health costs rising far beyond anything else, which is now crippling businesses, individuals, and the government.  Obama's health reform package was a half-measure that won't do anything to reduce costs for many years, and may not even do that even if it gets properly funded, which Republicans may not do.

All of the above can be blamed on the two-party, first past the post system of voting we currently have in America.  Unfortunately that cannot be changed without the cooperation of one or more of the two parties, who care more about their own party interest than the good of the country as a whole.

They are not a security organization.  They do not provide security from rape *because they rape*.  They do not provide security from unlawful searches *because every search they conduct is unlawful*.  They are repugnant and a mortal peril to our democracy.  

By supporting them politically, you're just as bad of a person: you support rape and the erosion of our Constitutional rights.  The only difference is that you're not criminally liable as they are, as you're not an active participant in the rape, nor did you order it or its cover-up.

The TSA must be dissolved.  All of its employees, through George Walker Bush and Barak Hussein Obama need to be indicted on charges of ordering, colluding in, or actually committing sexual assault and violation of the civil rights of every airline passenger since American airspace reopened in 2001.

"Or somehow he was dead long ago, but with new people deciding to run for president next year, Obama wanted to secure his re-election?
I'm no conspiracy theorist, but it's hard to ignore how suspicious it is that they won't release proof of Osama's death, just like it's hard to ignore how suspicious it is that they dumped his body right away, suddenly caring about his traditions even though Osama didn't care about our tradition of not killing each other.",2
"&gt; ""taking my money to give to people who are too lazy to work for their own healthcare"". 

This is not entirely true. People who are against it aren't against helping the poor or the sick, but against the state taking control of those situations for whatever reason they're against it (inefficiency, high rates of taxes that a non-profit or for-profit could run more efficiently, lower standards of care, fear of the government etc.). I believe those are all legitimate concerns that should be addressed and discussed rationally, rather than resorting to a ""HERP THEY HATE POOR PEOPLE.""

For the record, I'm all in favor of a government-option for healthcare. The Obama healthcare plan? More of a bailout for insurance companies.",1
"I think a lot of the rhetoric has to do with the reality of the mass media environment we live it. If you go back 40 years ago when we didn't have all news internet/radio/television stations a lot of news was dominated by a small number of news stories. The news stories that were covered were covered more in depth and with more analysis. The newspaper for instance could sit on a story for 12 hours, watch it develop it, research it and publish a well thought out article. 

Fast forward to today where we suffer from information overload. People who need to get their viewpoints out need to stand out. As well with the competition to publish many news stories are going out out poorly researched with the priority being on getting it published first. This extends not just to the media but the news makers themselves.

Consider the Republican who wishes to criticize the financial policies of President Obama. She could stand up and say, ""President Obama's cure for the economic woes involves greater government involvement in the lives of the people."" While perhaps truthful it will be buried in the rest of the news. Now if however she decides to say ""President Obama's cure for all our problems is communism,"" it will sell better.

Left leaning folk will probably be deeply offended that a democratic politician is being put in the same boat as North Korea and conservatives may take delight in derogatory language. Now instead of debating the economic policies of the current president both sides will be left to squabble over the appropriateness of a sound bite. Political debate has degenerated into a bunch of tweets. 

In the 140 character environment its fair to say a lot of stuff will be misinterpreted and misrepresented. In this type of environment where political debate and analysis becomes impossible is it any wonder that nobody gets anybody anymore?

"There's so much ambiguity in that word, and in the names of political ideologies in general. Obama is called a ""liberal"" by the American press but he's really more of a moderate and in much of Europe he would be considered conservative, and he supports a lot of neoliberal policies which real ""liberals"" strongly oppose and that the neoconservative Bush administration also supported. And the neoconservative Bush administration were called conservative by the American press, but 40 years ago if you were called ""conservative"" you would be libertarian by today's standards (in the United States), which the Bush administration was certainly not.

If they really were race terms then a gentleman of mixed heritage such as Barack Obama would have equal right to consider himself 'white' and be referred to as such. I have never heard him be referred to as 'white' and very rarely as 'mixed' he's pretty much always called 'black'. So the black white issues you have in the states are not racism. They are based on skin colour not genetics.

There is no NHS here, our retirement and pension system doesn't work (Social Security doesn't pay enough, company pensions get raided by the companies and you are not guaranteed to get a company pension, and most people can't afford a private life annuity), unemployment insurance lasts for a very short time in some states, disability insurance doesn't last very long, and during this recession white-collar work has enormously contracted. Even if the labor market in Western Europe is also contracted, at least you still have a much better welfare state. In the U.S. even people with a ""middle class"" background and college degrees are living paycheck to paycheck, sometimes without health insurance.

"I'm a lawyer with some familiarity with whistleblower laws.

Please understand that you have my utmost sympathies for being placed in such an untenable position.

However, whistleblowing generally involves allegations of illegal conduct.  Assuming that you live in the U.S., I don't see that you've alleged anything illegal.  It is not discriminatory to refuse bonuses to employees due to work injuries, as long as those injuries did not place them into protectable classes.  Additionally, you don't allege that your company falsified data in any reports or pressured employees not to report injuries.  You merely allege that employees sought reasons why reports might be falsified--which in fact is a legitimate business practice.

Also, you should realize that given the political realities in the U.S. these days, 1) courts/agencies will look for any reason not to find that illegal conduct occurred; 2) courts/agencies will look for any reason not to protect whistleblowers; 3) the activities described in (1) and (2) actually have gotten worse since Obama came into office.

This does not mean that you cannot report unsafe conduct to, for instance, OSHA.  OSHA has local offices in most major cities.  From what I recall, you can anticipate a more thorough response if you appear at the office in person.  But be forewarned: you should not expect whistleblower protection if you do so.  

I understand that this may not be the info you desire--and it may prove unpopular on reddit.  But neither of those change the reality you face.

In any event, wishing you well.

"Really you're arguing against this because truth is difficult to determine?  Every single law ever enacted is based on the ability to ascertain the truth of the defendant's guilt.  That's the whole point of burden of proof / standards of evidence etc.

&gt;If Glenn Beck honestly believes that Obama was born in Africa, can we in good faith throw him in jail?

Under this hypothetical law, if Glenn Beck wants to present his beliefs on-air then he either needs to ascertain them to a reasonable standard of evidence, or categorize his show as an entertainment show rather than a News program.  That's the entire point.  If Glenn Beck presents the facts that lead him to his belief (even if the conclusion is erroneous) I don't think anyone has a problem with that.  The problem is with utter fabrication of ""evidence"" such as editing video and presenting it as unedited etc which Fox News does on a regular basis.

Jail is a strawman argument.  The punishment could easily be fines leveraged against the network or something along those lines.

Why stop there then?  Maybe the Osama double is really a reptilian agent that murdered the real Osama back in 2001 and took his identity shortly before the bombings.  Since he is a reptilian he is cold blooded and thus can evade the US which uses heat signatures to find people.  When they come to bomb Obama he just has his posse run left, while his cold blooded self runs right.  Instant predator juke!

The whole purpose of this reptilian agent is to keep the US focused on the middle east, so that more reptilians can slowly kill off the guards for Area 51 and assume their identities.  Once they have enough to seize the base by force they will recapture their mothership and sail back to their home world, while leaving behind a bomb to obliterate the Earth.

The net effect is that any American president that does something ""anti-Israel"" seriously damages his reelection chances.

"&gt;Also, a false one.

It is not false.  The level of disgust we associate with a form of label for something we find disgusting is just a modern justification after the fact for stupid ideas of the past.  Skite became shit and ended up on the shitlist of words you could not say during the plague because it was believed to be associated with the plague.  If you said shit, you got sick and died.

And it was wrong.

Every culture has its taboo words, even within languages.  The Brits and more recent independencies have ""bloody"" which would get your mouth washed out with soap 50 years ago.   Your mouth may be safe today, but newspapers and other publications still write the word b______y.   And despite it probably being a relatively recent profane word, its etymology is just as foggy as all the other ""cursed"" words.  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody

Cunt goes way back, but only became an expletive in the 18th century.  Up to that time, it was in common use.  In fact, it seems to have had the double meaning of a stupid person and the female genitalia back to its origins.  So, how did it become bad?  It's also interesting to note that since the 1970s, it has become MORE of a bad word.  And the reason is pretty simple.  Modern feminist women objected to it, and women basically trained one another to react when anyone says it.  After 40 years of women collectively going into hysterics any time someone says it, it has marched right up the ""bad"" list and now sits near the top.  

And by now everyone knows that the difference between a circus and a strip club is that a circus has cunning stunts.

But in the US, one word holds more sway as being evil than any other.  And it is the newest one.  And it is only evil for you to say it if your skin is not dark enough.  If your skin is dark enough, you can say it all you want, and many of those folks consider it almost adulation.  See, if I was black, I could just type n-i-g-g-a (or like the British press and type n____r) and everything would be A-OK.  But I'm not, so it's bad.  

Is it arbitrary?  Capricious?  Didn't it start out just meaning ""black""?

It's not the only word making a dramatic shift in value.  *Queer* and *fag* and many others are becoming both more powerful and more widely regarded as bad.  Will they ever get bleeped?  Who knows?  They might have already.

Certainly every language and culture has and has had its words that cause the speaker to be judged harshly for using those words in the wrong environment or wrong context.  Could the vice-president get away with saying ""fuck"" with no repercussions?  Well, our last two have.  Apparently fuck is almost OK now.  Would Obama be in deep shit if cameras caught him greeting some black person like Michael Jordon or Common as ""my nigga"" ... even if it was not intended to be overheard?  Probably not.  But, could a bigoted white Republican Congressman get away with calling inner city, poor African Americans ""a bunch of lazy ass, good for nuthin' niggers""?  Imagine his head on a chopping block with a couple of executioners dressed in sterile white robes ... no wait, that doesn't fit ... dressed in black robes and with black masks and wielding a large executioner's sword.  Now we have the image right ...

And as I explained earlier, there may have been a biological advantage from keeping too much information from children, although there didn't seem to be much of a problem with telling them made up stories about invisible men and fairies and bunnies that bring you presents.  

You have to admit that the rules are ***arbitrary***, and the South Park episode did a remarkable job of pointing that out with Ms. Chōksondik's explanation of the acceptable versus the unacceptable forms of the word shit. 

**Acceptable:**

* As a noun meaning bad: ""My life is shit.""

* As a noun meaning good: ""My life is The Shit.""

* As an adjective meaning bad: ""I've had a shitty day.""

* As an exclamation of disappointment:  ""Shit!  My car won't start.""


**Unacceptable:**

* As a noun referring to feces: ""He stepped in shit.""

* As an adjective referring to feces:  ""The baby has a shitty diaper.""


Much like you can say, ""I have four hens and a *cock*"" and it is fine, but when you say, ""I want to put my *cock* in your ass"" ... well, now we have a problem.  V is for vagina, p is for pussy, c is for cock, d is for dick.  Your brain has to feed them through a deeply nested algorithm to determine what our qualitative reaction to the word should be when we hear it or read it.

And it is all just humans making up arbitrary rules, then trying to justify them and the power they wish to have over other people for using those words inappropriately.  Some would even go to the extreme of painting the images of the words in sterile white robes ...

And in regards to tradition, just because the original justification might have been lost, that does not mean every tradition is bogus.  Some traditions were based on sound reasons.  And I never said all traditions are stupid.  Only the stupid ones.

And everyone knows if there is enough pushback on a stupid tradition, it will die a slow death.  For example, the tradition of buying and selling people you could conquer and deemed inferior ... that one has died out for the most part.   That tradition got superseded by jobs and credit cards and mortgages.",5
"Generally, when an organization personally takes credit for something, they're supporting it.  Obama takes credit for Obamacare.  He supports it.  See?  it's quite easy.  Source?  try actually reading the thing I linked, like I did to your links.  Oh, and stop trying to compare killing of innocent people via suicide bombings to medical experiments done over 50 years ago.  They're not on the same level.  Killing innocents for political means vs killing innocents to advance science and curing diseases both are bad, but one kind of out weighs the other.  In one case people were going about the business, and they were blown into tiny pieces, and the other people were at least partially aware of what was happening.",2
"Working as a retail manager for a corporate store was by far the worst job I've ever had. I'd never worked a corporate job before and I've pretty much promised myself I never will again, if I can help it. 

The money was quite good but my personal life was shot to hell. Ten hour days plus a one hour commute each way was a good day. Holidays and weekends were non-existent. I'd often get home at midnight just to be up again at six am.

You also see some of the worst of humanity. People fling their phones at your head for not giving them a refund, train their kids to bring DVDs into the restroom to stuff into their backpacks and tell you during a transaction that the country is going to hell because Obama is an illegal alien. 

I loved most of the people that I worked with but, seriously, my minimum wage deli job as a teen was light years better than that job.",3
"Basically he is assuming Obama won't get re-elected. Knowing this guy, it figures.",2
"I'm completely burned out. I work from 7 am to 6 or 7 pm every day, 6 days a week and I'm usually on call on Sundays. I get 10 days of vacation a year, and most of the time I try to take it I'm denied because we're too ""short staffed"" and instead they just pay out whatever vacation I didn't take at the end of the year. Well, they just announced they're ending that and whatever I don't take just disappears. 

There's been a hiring freeze the last year and a half. To announce this the douche bags from corporate flew in from the west coast on private jets to announce how tight money is and that we need to sacrifice in order for the company to survive. We have taken on a boatload of new business this year but still had layoffs back in April. There's absolutely no way the company isn't making at least double what we were making last year. We were also told the over time is going to continue (going on 8 months now) because it's cheaper to pay us for an extra 20 hours a week than it is to hire other people and have to give them benefits. This was followed by a sermon about how health insurance would be cheaper if everyone purchased it themselves, rather than have the company they work for provide it and other rants about socialized medicine and how ""ObamaCare"" might bankrupt our business. Right.

The best part is that I make 60-65% of what the entry level average is for my job in this area...the problem is that other places aren't hiring. Some noob at a place 5 minutes away, doing the exact same job I am gets paid what I do with all my over time while working a normal 9-5. 

I asked my boss for a raise, was denied and told that if I didn't like it, I could walk out of the door and was lucky to even have a job. Of course he said they could show me the ""mountain"" of resumes they had with people willing to take my job and that I should just shut up, keep my head down and do my work. His explanation was that money was tight across the entire company and they simply couldn't pay me even another 50 cents an hour even if he wanted to because corporate just would never approve it. I was later told by a different supervisor that wages for employees aren't decided by corporate. Every supervisor has a budget to run everything, purchase inventory and pay their employees in their department. Whatever is not used they gets to pocket at the end of the year. Sometimes they can get $20k bonuses simply by being as cheap as possible. Awesome.

I saw in the paper the other day that KFC is hiring right now, and they start out at $10.50 an hour. I know for a fact the hours are better and even though it won't look as good on my resume it's only 50 cents less than what I'm making now, I'll have more time to do what I want and will probably add a few years onto my life because it won't be nearly as stressful. It's tempting.

If you're wondering what business I'm in: I mix IV medications at an institutional pharmacy in Oregon. I heard that our company pays their employees better in other states but I'm pretty sure that's just a myth. ",3

"My father worked overseas in Africa and we went out to a small town that was flooded to help out with the planes and WTP operations. 

We got back into the city after a week, I was dirty, tired and wanted to go home.  But my dad was on a business call for a good hour.  I was about 18 at the time.  Walking around the hanger, kinda pissed I had to wait so long. 

Finally, I go back into the office and start complaining I wanted to go home, my dad gets all pissed and yells **take a fucking cab**

Take a cab?  Alright...so I walked out of the airport security area and to the nearest gas station.  I'm a white dude amongst a shanty town.  In fact, it was close to where Obama's brother lived, but this was way before Obama was prez. 

So I go into the gas station and ask for a cab.  The guy says, ""Ok, no problem"" and we negotiate a price. He says he'll be right back.  2 minutes later he's at the front of the station, honking his horn, in his own car.  

Fuck it, I got in the car and proceeded to explain where the flat was I was staying at.  I didn't have a street name or address but I remembered it was close to a mall/plaza that had stained glass.  He knew what I was talking about and we were off. 

He drove pretty well and we conversed but the car was just barely hanging on.  Steam coming out, the engine sputtering.  

Finally we get to the flat.  I walk in and ask my mom for 80 shillings.  Walked out, gave him the money and thanked him.

"- Social Programs are not a bad thing, ineffective, inefficient, unsustainable or counter-productive social programs are, or social programs that are outside the scope of the government entity administering them, or social programs designed to combat a social ill that should not be combated. Remember, not all social programs are created equal. 

- Cutting taxes can lead to more revenue if the current tax rate is high enough to stifle the economy. Would you rather have 50 percent of 1 dollar, or 25 percent of 3 dollars? The great debate, of course, is how high is too high, or how low is too low.  I think we're mostly in agreement that 100 percent is too high, and zero is too low, but there's a lot of room in between. 

- Coming to an agreement with a Democratic president is a problem for Republicans, because they are members of opposite political parties. Members of the House of Representatives stand for re-election every two years. They not only have to face an opponent from the opposing party, but they can face primary election challengers from their own party. Since the prevailing mentality in the U.S. among voters is much the same as the prevailing mentality of sports fans, ""beating"" the other side is extremely important for members of congress who's district leans heavily to their own party. It's not about finding a solution, it's about having soundbites to bring back home, and to generate campaign donations.
     Remember how excited all the Reddit Democrats got when Obama walked out of that meeting? That's just how excited Republicans get when their guys refuse to consider his plan. Both sides are scoring points with their own people, for ""standing up to"" the other side.

"Every politician's goal is to look out for himself, sure. But as a group, politicians in the USA have the shared goal of keeping the masses distracted with non issues (like the birth certificate bullshit you mentioned), so that they don't get too focused on facts like fighting a bullshit war, being screwed by corporations and generally getting almost nothing out of their government. It's one thing for the republicans to attack obama directly and accuse him of lying. To attack democrats is one thing, to think they would destroy the faith the American public has in their government, trust the Republicrat and Democran parties have lied so hard to build, is completely irrational. 

You're kidding yourself if they would ever draw attention to the fact that the US government, or part of it, is lying to the American public, as that would be alerting the masses to the very facts all politicians are trying to keep you from noticing: that the government, as a whole, is dishonest, and not accountable to the American people.

"No, for a huge number of reasons.
For starters, there are major benefits to national regulators: predictable, universal standards across state lines, a single location for experts dealing with an issue, and an absence of competition between regulators racing to the bottom.
Plus, in a lot of instances, state-by-state regulation is bad for other states. As an example, if I open a chemical plant in Memphis because Tennessee has weaker environmental regulations than Louisiana, why should New Orleans suffer (since both are on the Mississippi river, but New Orleans is downstream from Memphis). Memphis gets all the benefits and New Orleans gets all the external costs with no recourse.

Edit, because you also asked about freeing up tax revenue: If 50 states each had to have their own comprehensive resources for every current cabinet department, you'd have a lot of specialization, but also a ton of redundancy, which increases cost. You'd have experts in say, West Virginia, Colorado, and New York all trying to analyze the environmental effects of a new coal plant on their air, and I'm not really convinced you'd have dramatically different results, just 3x the cost. Plus, I think you'd have a lot of very small offices getting their information from self-interested business white papers and their associated lobbyists, and publishing that info as if it were neutral.

* Read the actual legislation to filter through the spin and commentary

* Also, check out the Congressional Budget Office's report on the legislation for a more objective view - http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=508

"**STORY ON #1**

So this was in early 2009, about a month or two into the 111th Congress after Obama was inaugurated. I interned for the United States senate as an office/phone wonk who occasionally ran errands to the Capitol. To get to the Cloakroom in the Capitol, you took a special subway system and take an elevator to floor 2 from the basement.

Anyway, these are small fucking elevators. I mean they were probably installed when elevators were invented or something. They probably could fit at maximum 4 people comfortably.

Regardless, I get on in the basement with 4 other interns/staffers/etc. when out of nowhere John McCain and about 4 other Republican senators were passing the elevator.

Now, I know what you're going to say, ""Hey KibblesnBitts, aren't there 'Senator Only' elevators in the Capitol?""

Why thank you for asking, yes, there are elevators that are only allowed to be used by Senators. However, Senator McCain said, ""Hey guys, we can get to the floor faster if we just go on this one."" referring to the open elevator that's already packed with staffers and wonks.

Now there are about 10-11 people in this elevator that can barely fit 5 people comfortably. I back up to the wall because fuck it, this guy just lost the presidential election. He apparently didn't notice me, because he began to back up to the wall, crushing me between the wall and him.

And these elevators aren't the fastest either, so for an eternity...probably 45 seconds, I was squeezed between him and the elevator wall. And I felt my crotchical region right on his blubbery ass, trying to move away from it, but barely budging in this cramped box.

When we all got out, he stumbled and I caught him. He said ""Thanks son."" and walked away.

And that's how I grinded on John McCain in an elevator.",24

Exploration: Yuri Gargarin and Neil Armstrong.

Religion: I think Dawkins might really make a name for himself. As good of a biologist as he is, most of his fame is for his beliefs (or lack of them) and his books have been pretty influential at a time when atheism is on the rise.

If you want to learn actual facts, which don't agree with Fox News and are therefore called ""liberal"" instead of just ""accurate"", you go to any of a half dozen other cable news stations. 

Fox News has gotten so brazen with lying during broadcasts (labeling disgraced Republicans as Democrats, grossly miscalculating figures so that they support a conservative viewpoint) that they've made hard news facts seem like an idea that's just for liberals. 

This is a network that considers asking Obama ""Does it bother you that so many people hate you?"" is 'fair and balanced'. The only way to answer it is to begin by agreeing that ""so many people hate me"". This is their idea of an interview that ""Proves we're fair and balanced.""

"&gt;If reddit had mostly female users, I assure you it'd get asked.

Well, obviously there is no way to know that; but I don't think so. Either way it's unverifiable. And, even more obviously, it would be just as wrong.

&gt;I hear girls comment on Obama's cuteness all the damn time. The fact that you think only guys do this is, ironically, rather sexist.

I was not saying girls do not comment on people's ""cuteness"" overall; I was saying that in my experience, they do not do this when it is entirely irrelevant to what has actually been said. Clearly you have different experiences to me. By the way, I would still find girls unnecessarily commenting on a guy's appearance annoying and uncalled for.

&gt;If they stay in your sight, I don't see how that hurts anyone.

What, so if a woman is standing in front of you and all you are looking at is her breasts, you see NOTHING wrong with that?

&gt;You have no right to demand I NOT look at you in a public place where privacy is not expected.

You're right, I don't. What I'm saying is I have the right to demand you don't look at me in a way that's making me uncomfortable (i.e. gormlessly at my breasts), or stare/ogle me (which is what we're talking about, not just ""looking"" at someone).

&gt;How the FUCK is this different?

Because the woman in a picture is not being bothered by you looking at her (unless you then start stalking her or something). A woman in real life will probably notice if you are staring at her and it will make her uncomfortable. How is this going over your head?

&gt;So the victims of war in news photos are being victimised again?

No, because nobody is laughing at them or trying to make light of what has happened to them. The attitude is as important as the pictures.

&gt;Yes, I'm sure they wake up with leprosy after being offended

We're not just talking about offense here; we're talking about flashbacks and triggering images. Tell me, if you or a close family member/friend had been in the army (for example) and lost a limb or died, and then you found a subreddit where people were mocking soldiers for being wounded or killed, saying it was their fault or that they deserved it in some way, would you still have the same blasé attitude? If the answer is yes there's clearly no way I'm going to get through to you, by the way.

&gt;You mean the tiny amount of redditors who look at that subreddit? Many of whom do it for the troll/wtf factor, and many others who have some kind of fetish who would likely never take part in such acts?

So it's fine if a) they find it amusing to make others feel bad/cause flashbacks/cause intense psychological hurt, b) they just find it weird but apparently don't care enough to stop, c) would never take part in actually beating a woman but completely support a page which actively condones and supports it? None of those are enough for me, especially not the last one, because they can go to a BDSM subreddit/website where the acts are consensual rather than a misogynistic and hateful page where consent doesn't seem to matter.

Also, 824 redditors view it. Maybe as a percentage of redditors that's a tiny amount, but that's 824 people in real life that I do not want to meet.

&gt;So?

So, as per your previous (though imo wrong) argument, why should they make a fuss about taking it down?",8

"I'd like to point out that I'm not out to belabor the point or to beat a dead horse. A few things you're saying raise more questions though.

&gt; Back to debt...

The US is already spending too much on the DoD. The amounts I read are just surreal. There is no proportion to it. The US has the best air force in the history of the planet. There is -nobody- who would try and take them on. They've got nothing. The SR-71 was the bleeding edge in the 60s and there hasn't been a better plane built since then. All that spending is at the cost and to the detriment of spending that would be better allocated to improve the lives of Americans directly [infrastructure, schools, manufacturing...]. It's fun to build a GBU-43/B and to make them go *boom* but that doesn't build a country.

&gt; from a military point of view I think that we're in a better situation than we were 30 or 40 years ago.

How do you reckon that? The US has been in Afghanistan a decade now. Ten years. In this year the US is going to spend about $150 billion dollars on the war there. Do you know how much money that is? In 2009 the Afghanistan GDP (purchasing power parity) was estimated at $26.98 billion [source: the CIA world factbook]. The US could afford to hire -absolutely-every one- in Afghanistan, double their pay, give them universal health care and it would cost less than half of what the US is going to spend on the war there this year. And that's only for this year. 

So, you tell me: how much is it actually worth to you to keep this war going? Is there absolutely no amount of money you're not willing to spend to keep them 'fighting over there so that they won't come here'? Does it not strike you as the least bit awkward that the richest nation in the world [TM] is spending such an enormous amount of money fighting an enemy that has pistols/AK-47s, .cal 50s, the occasional roadside bomb and not very much of anything else? And that this has been going on for 10 years? Would you be happy for your operations where you work to be this efficient? The US has twice of everything, it is spending biblical amounts of money fighting one of the least sophisticated adversaries in 50 years. And they can't score a decisive win. And that's ok with you? That's 'a better situation than we were 30 or 50 years ago? Honestly? Are you willing to spend absolutely any amount to keep this war going? Wouldn't you like some kind of tangible result after 10 years time? I mean: I'm happy to give the military 5 years to get used to the place and find out where all the good bars are. No problem, it's fine with me. But 10 years? And we're still going at  it? What is your boundary condition? When would -you- say: ok, we've had it, this is as good as we're going to get this, we're out. Guys, pack up, we're going home.

- Media. I'm still thinking Obama gets the rougher deal but I don't actually care about it that much. He wanted the job, he knows what's coming with it.

- Wikileaks: Manning in subjected to sensory deprivation. And this for so long already that he's running a very real risk of permanent neurological damage. And he's not been tried yet. The CIA uses sensory depravation as an interrogation tool. These are not soft people, they don't do that because it doesn't have an effect on a person. They do it specifically because it has an effect on a person.

Any of the factors [there's a bunch, I'm not going to type 'em all here] don't amount to a broken nation on the brink of collapse. A big country like the US can take some punishment. Take them all together, in this time segment and I really start to worry about the inevitable. Here is one that I particularly worry about: high schools are graduating too many functional illiterates. People who can hardly read or write at their grade level. People who don't read and who are not intellectually challenged by big ideas. In an age where the competition for new ideas is going to be absolutely fierce when you think about how many engineers graduate in China alone every year. It does not bode well.

I'd have a much better life if I stopped worrying about all this and chased more women.

My opinion has been solidified by the fact that no particularly good Republican candidates have turned up nor are likely to, now that time's almost up for getting in the race.  Each and everyone of them, I think ""that candidate cannot get the nomination!"" except... one of them's gotta.  Right now it looks like Mitt Romney is the most likely.  I have a hard time imagining him actually beating Obama.

All that said, though, if the economy gets really bad again, Obama will have too much of an uphill struggle; there's a point at which if the economy is bad enough, almost any Republican nominee could win.  I do not believe it is that bad right now (it's bad, but not Romney-beats-Obama bad).  We'll see how it develops.

I do feel that some Republicans in Congress understand this and are actively trying to ensure the economy gets worse over the coming year, though that's hard to prove, and I'm sure there are plenty of Republicans who honestly believe in what they're doing.

Edit: BTW, I live in Massachusetts and have been very very actively involved in MA politics since ~2003ish.  Romney was our governor, and boy was he a disappointment.  He didn't run for re-election, but I'm sure he knew he had no chance and that was part of why he chose not to run.",2

"&gt;Where did you stay while travelling, did you move around all the time or rent houses or just sleep in a tent?

I have stayed at places ranging from a suite that Obama stayed in at the Hilton on Copacabana beach in rio de janiero ($1200/night) to a guest house on Koh San Rd in Bangkok, Thailand ($2/night). Most cities have inexpensive guest houses/hostels. I have also rented a house in the Mountains and spent weeks on trains (Trans-Siberian and Trans-Canadian). Never in a tent although some of the beach bungalows are little more than a few logs and a bed. I have slept under the stars on quite a few beaches in the Caribbean.

&gt;Did you ever get into any dangerous/crazy situations?

Only once, I was drugged and robbed at a bar. I woke up in a luxurious condo with no shoes and no wallet. Also I saw Chinese police (6 men) kick and beat a young 13 year old Tibetean girl to death in a Lhasa street. I suspect I was followed for a few blocks in Lima, Peru. I have had lots of ""friends"" move into my apartment, one of them stole gold from me. Another one was a doctor and he faked a medical emergency because he wanted me to wake up and go to lunch with him. I was in a nightclub once when the police came in and started drug testing everyone (pee in a cup style). I was dancing at a huge outdoor rave party on the beach with a group of friends, someone passed something to sniff, I sniffed it and woke up in the nurse station an hour later. I was in a city during a coup d'état, I saw the tanks rolling in and take control of the capital. Another time where a group of protesters closed down the airport and set up protest camps in the streets for months. I was on a tiny wooden boat crossing the border from Mynamar to Thailand where I knew the guy next to me was smuggling a lot of cocaine (I didn't know him but I saw what was going on). I fell down the side of a mountain and into the ocean after my little motorbike hit a pot hole in the road. I was standing on the street next to an Army General that was shot in the head by a sniper. I once ended up a mansion filled with teenagers that turned into a giant orgy. I met Katy Perry at her CD release party. I was with a friend in London and Madonna was there, one of her bodyguards knocked him over and Madonna picked him up, kissed him and danced with us. I was scuba diving in the Cayman Islands and a large fish the size of my arm came up and took a bite out of my side. I was in a park in Atlanta during the Olympics when a bomb went off. A drug sniffing dog at the airport in Taipei didn't like something he was smelling and I was stripped searched. I almost killed myself climbing a big mountain in Peru near Machu Picchu (but the pictures were worth it). I got several mysterious tropical diseases. I was on a bus riding across the driest desert in the world and it broke down. My bus tickets were stolen from my hand in a train station in Argentina. I fell prey to many unscrupulous taxi drivers in Hanoi. Also I missed my flight out of Saigon. In the Amazon my canoe got stuck between two large trees in the flooded forest and when I got out to try get it out several large spiders jumped on me then several large fish swarmed in to eat the spiders. I swan in a piranha infested river with my sister, afterwards caught several and ate them for dinner. I became addicted to several pharmaceutical drugs and had to taper myself off of them. Took up and quite smoking for a year. A Jamaican doctor preformed an unnecessary surgery on my arm then his Nurse demanded double the free. I got violent food poisoning several times. I found a valuable treasure at a market in Laos. I took my portable hard drive with my 10 year mp3 collection in a backpack to the beach and the tide came in and carried it off. Fell madly in love with several locals. Met a princess. Got a job lecturing at a University. Helped one of my students write his application to Harvard graduate school. He got in, graduated and is now working at the IMF and gives me a few market tips as a thank you. I ate some amazingly delicious food. I was in the driver seat when my friend crashed his BMW into a police car on the highway and paid his way out of it. I paid a bribe to get a friend out of jail. I lived in a house made of of teak wood infested with cockroaches and geckos. I was bitten by a rabid street dog. I was tricked by a 'ladyboy' but too drunk to care. I became a Buddhist monk for a week.

&gt;How did you pick your locations (the countries as well as the places within)?

Sometimes I planned it out, other times I would go to a region and just start somewhere and make it up along the way. Generally I would pick a region- South America, start in one country and keep going until I am tired.

&gt;How much did your one year trip cost you?

I picked up some contracts along the way and found some paying jobs but probably around $20-30k. I quickly earned it back however because I decided to stay in a few countries for a few years and work.

&gt;Did you travel alone?

I have traveled with my sister, my ex, a friend, new friends I met along the way and alone.

&gt;How did you spend an average day?

Depends on how much time in each city. I would recommend 3 days minimum. It takes around 2 days to get a feel for how a city moved, how the streets work etc. So you have to learn how to get around, learn basic communications, find where you want to go and what is interesting to do and what is good to eat.

&gt;What would you say is the most important thing you learned while travelling? Any mind altering realizations?

Human beings think we know it all but actually we have very little figured out. Western commercial culture with it's focus on materialism is basically the lowest common denominator state of human existence. Unfortunately like a virus it is spreading everywhere. Corporations are destroying the world. Almost everyone dislikes dominance, aggression and slavery and the US is basically forcing those things on the world and is thus universally disliked. People are basically the same everywhere- almost universally compassionate. Most mind altering realizations in my life came before I traveled from my study of mycology :)",1
"The vast majority of our deficit, vis a vis year 2000, comes from:

* Bush tax cuts
* Medicare part D
* Iraq/Afghanistan wars
* Two big economic downturns (and the bailout/stimulus that went with the latter)

The those top two account for 600B dollars.

Cutting taxes in 2000 was predicated on having a huge surplus (800B/year predicted!).

The reality of it is: Cutting taxes, no matter how bad a policy, plays well with the public. Why? Because everyone wants something for nothing. No one lists shit that should be cut. They rage against ""entitlements"" and ""wasteful spending"" and then when asked for an example, they cite the fact that Obama had a foreign dignitary barbeque and spent .000000000001% of the budget on it. The big things that devour our cash - like 700B on the military, or 54B/year for medicare Part D.

Good news: I just solved the budget deficit. New military funding: $50B/year. Medicare Part D: gone. Bush tax cuts: removed. Our deficit is now smaller than the rate of inflation.",2
"Kinda related. Maybe not.

My choir teacher likes to go on tirades about aspects of our class that he hates. He is also very hypocritical. I once asked if I could skip his class because I needed to retake a Biology final. He flipped and said that his class is far more important, and that my scheduling is my problem, and that my teacher can deal with it. The very same class he spent about 10 minutes trying to persuade me to miss a math test so I could help him set up his sound system for a choir concert, because he's to lazy to read the 7 page user manual for his microphones.

He is also horrifically xenophobic, homophobic and makes racist jokes and when confronted, says its all just jokingly. Then one day I made a Mormon joke unaware he was within earshot (he's Mormon), he flipped and reported me to the Dean of Student Affairs.

Ironically enough, him sending me to the Dean allowed me to tell her about his class, and after talking to students who he threw out of class (including one awesome black guy I know who called him quote ""an ignorant and racist m*****f***** after he made a joke about Obama painting the white house black), caused him to be placed under surveillance.

"In regards to the helicopter, three men, people who heard fighting: I'm not saying we would have made the whole story up, or that we didn't send a SEAL team there, I'm sure that we did.

It is possible that he died years ago as you say in hiding with his cohorts.  Most likely they would have buried him (I don't see what reason they would have to destroy his corpse), maybe even in a friendly region like Abbottabad.

I don't see why they would want to tell the world that he was dead, after all he was the figurehead to inspire like-minded people.  The US wouldn't have much to gain from telling the world, assuming we even knew.  ""Oh sorry the big bad guy we all love to hate died of natural causes.""  There's no justice done in that story.

And yes Obama is up for re-election relatively soon.  In fact, it was the same day (May 1) before another election year (2003) when GWB announced ""Mission Accomplished.""

"[Here are the numbers](http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph).  The one percent are those making approx. 1.1 million per year, while at the same time paying lower tax rates than the 99%.

This is a result of the bulk of the income of the one percent is not taxed under income tax but is instead taxed under the much lower rate for capital gains income.  This disparity in tax rates gets more extreme for those who make even more.  The result is that billionaires like Warren Buffet pay tax rates which are a token compared to the rates being paid by his secretaries.  He feels this is grossly unfair, and he has spoken out about it, and now he is considered a traitor to the 1% and they doing everything in their power to discredit him.

The principle that the rich should pay at least as high a rate on their income as everyone else pays is called 'The Buffet Rule'.  At the moment the 1% not only have a grossly disproportionate amount of the wealth, but also a grossly disproportionate amount of the political power.  

As a result of this, many people no longer believe the political system can produce a government which will represent them.  They are frustrated with government as it is, and disillusioned with the political process, and so they are protesting the 'status quo.'

EDIT:  Btw it is disingenuous for these people who keep quoting the 380,000 income figure as being the top 1%.  They know (or should know by now - as I have repeatedly corrected them on prior threads) that is only the portion of the income of the 1% that is taxed under income tax.  The other approx. 700,000 of their income is taxed at the far lower capital gains tax rate.

Yeah - Metssuck I am looking at you.  I know you know better because you not only admitted it but you argued on another thread that the capital gains income should continue to be taxed at the lower rate, as doing so was important for saving jobs.  So quit pretending that the 1% income is actually the lower amount which is taxed under income tax rates.  Does anyone still believe that crap that if we continue to tax the rich at lower rates than the poor it will be good for the economy?

Please do not take my word for it - read through Metssuck's comment history.  He is one of those preaching Fox News' propaganda like how 'Obamacare' ought to be repealed.",0

That's not bribery, and calling it that makes people more stupid. Call it what it is: *compromise*.

&gt; I would say the Solyndra loan is clearly corruption.

Not without evidence of same, you won't. ""The government bet on the wrong horse"" is not corruption. It's just a well-intentioned attempt at supporting research into new energy sources that turned out not to work in practice.

Except for the part where Cheney did not actually have an interest in Halliburton. His only relationship to the company while he was in office was receiving deferred compensation which was part of a *previous* employment agreement. That compensation was not tied in any way to the company's performance; had Halliburton gone completely out of business, Cheney still would have received the rest of his compensation.

This is why I asked the question. Lots of people love to allege corruption. Problem is, they can't actually back their allegations up. They just point to things they don't like, or things they don't *understand* because they didn't keep up with current events, and say ""Corruption!"" Except it really isn't so.

3. He wants to allow the people in the state decide. And yes, he too is personally against abortion. As a young doctor, he saw an aborted fetus  gasp for air and die after being discarded. So, I don't really blame him.

I see that in your edit you once again reference race.  What's your obsession? It's interesting that many ""progressives"" or whatever love to call guys like RP racist, when it's absolutely anything but the truth, yet they themselves clearly display racist tendencies by being so obsessed w/ race, themselves.  

Here's what RP says on racism:

""Racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism, the mindset that views humans strictly as members of groups rather than individuals. Racists believe that all individuals who share superficial physical characteristics are alike: as collectivists, racists think only in terms of groups. By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality, the advocates of so-called “diversity” actually perpetuate racism. Their obsession with racial group identity is inherently racist. The true antidote to racism is liberty. Liberty means having a limited, constitutional government devoted to the protection of individual rights rather than group claims.""

Anyway, I'm not sure how researched you are on RP, but these criticisms aren't overly in-depth.  Regardless, who would you actually support?  I really hope it's not Obama - a man who has just recently put the nail in the coffin for all Americans' civil liberties (NDAA act), supports the deadly drug war, and is basically a corporate whore (receiving the most in big bank donations well over any other candidate.)",0

Briefly:  I'm a 30-something white male living on the opposite side of the country from my mother.  In general we've had a very good, close
relationship, but recently she's changing and I'm heartbroken over it.  Saturday we were on the phone and the following exchange occurred:

Me:  Isn't there a shuttle launch scheduled for today?

Her:  Yes.  And Obama is visiting because Gabby Gifford is there.  Isn't that wonderful.
(observation #1:  How is it that people with these kinds of distortions in their thinking can disapprove of literally every action 
their chosen target takes, no matter how neutral?)

Me:  Mm hmm.  (Hoping that the conversation will move on to something else.)

Her:  Sweet little Obama.

Me:  Mm hmm.

Her:  Sweet little nigger.

And then I hung up and turned my phone off, and couldn't think straight for the next 3 hours.  

(Observation #2:  Why is it that these ignoramuses can't help themselves and keep repeating their poison apparently expecting you to agree?  Why this need to make you agree?  ""Why yes, you're right!  He IS a nigger!""  Is that what she was expecting me to say?)

(Observation #3:  Pointing again to just frank stupidity as the cause of this kind of ""thinking"", these people have trouble remembering that not everyone agrees with them.  In fact even after repeated explosions they still don't get it.  This is the fourth time in 5 years that she has used a racial slur in conversation with me.  Despite that each time this has provoked an explosion from me, every single time, she's equally surprised and puzzled.  For goodness sake RATS learn to avoid electrified platforms faster than that.)

(Observation #4:  My ex-wife, who my mother adores and I'm still on good terms with, is Chinese, and has occasionally been the target of racist comments which badly upset my white mother.  How can the inconsistency not make her head catch on fire.)

I think for most of us, when we hear this from some ignorant jackass we don't know, we dismiss them as an ignorant jackass, and we don't associate with them one second longer, that's that.  But this is a woman who explicitly brought me up to treat people equally.  What happened to her to make her into this nasty old woman?  One explanation that I'm more and more worried about is that she's in the early stages of dementia.  I could understand why racism would be more at home in a malfunctioning brain.

So today I called her back to try to get her to understand why what she said was wrong.  Unfortunately I accurately predicted how the conversation would go, which means the whole thing was futile, but I tried.  She was vaguely aware that she might have said something that angered me, but the word nigger was insignificant enough to her that she didn't even remember using it and.  She thought it was just because she said bad things about OBAMA specifically.    (Observation #5:  This reflects another trait of people who think like this:  if you don't join them in foaming at the mouth every time Obama is mentioned, or whoever their chosen nemesis is, that means you must be an ardent supporter of that person with a shrine to him in your house.  These people have no ability to understand that it's possible to dislike someone's policies or frankly even dislike someone personally for petty reasons without thinking in terms of racial slurs or thinking they're the absolute evil.  For the record, I am not generally a strong Obama supporter, but this has to do with specific policy decisions.

As I predicted, she was very remorseful - but only for upsetting me.  When I told her that the problem wasn't that she had upset me, she was absolutely at sea as to what other problem there could be; that is, she just couldn't grasp the idea of a moral principle that exists separately from how certain people happen to react to something.(Observation #6:  Again pointing to just plain lack of cognitive development, these people often cannot think in terms of moral principles beyond just someone in your in-group doesn't like something, and usually don't even understand what you're talking about when you try to explain what a ""principle"" is.)

Finally I gave up and told her I was sad to find that my mother talked like she lived in a trailer park, and she said something very guarded that be if she talked like that at home it was her business.  (Observation #7:  For these people, there's never any way of evaluating ""beliefs"", if this could even be put in that category.  Everything is about guarding one's current beliefs from possible scrutiny or confrontation with opposing viewpoints.)

(Observation #8:  Perhaps most galling, these people absolutely bristle at anyone who dares suggest that they're racists.  To people who ""think"" like this, apparently as long as you only use racial slurs under your breath or behind closed doors, then you're not a racist.  As long as there's no confrontation it's all okay.  What, do you have to actually physically attack people before you're a racist?)

Sorry to take up everyone's time.  I don't mean to hijack the thread but this comment reminded me of my recent situation.  Obviously I was also moved to post this by my own anger at seeing a person I used to respect degenerate into cowardice and smallness.  But what's important is that if any of these behaviors or beliefs seem familiar to you as a reader, then by identifying them and seeing how they correlate, maybe we can use that to eliminate them faster.

I would also add about humor (on reddit or elsewhere), there's a very fine line between using racial slurs ironically - ""come on, I'm just saying it because we both know it's for shock value and I don't really believe it"" - versus saying it in earnest, in terms of how people react to it.  In an ideal world we'll all be able to use all these words entirely for humor eventually, but right now they can still hurt people even if intended entirely as inclusive humor.

"There's been a strain of conservatism around for a while which goes by the name ""libertarianism."" The idea behind it is that the best government is the smallest government, the government that does the least. Libertarians often support nice things like legalizing pot, reducing military spending, etc. They also support reduced taxes, which makes them appealing to more traditional conservatives.

Libertarianism has for a while been a minority portion of conservatism. However, with the election of Obama and the passing of health care reform, many conservatives decided that what they really disagreed with Obama about was the size of government. (This was not, in fact, true. They mostly disagreed with him for social issues.) In particular, they argued that a government that could give health care to all its citizens was necessarily a government too big.

So, this became a big conservative movement, this quasi-libertarian argument towards shrinking government. All this was wrapped in flag-waving jingoism (hence the Revolutionary War iconography, coupled with the insistence on ""securing the border,"" as absurd and contradictory as all that sounds). Anyway, that's what we're at now: we have this huge ""Tea Party"" movie that claims to hate large government (which is a front to give them an excuse for hating Obama) while nonetheless tending to support heavy military spending, ""securing the border,"" and other policies that would require *larger* government.

Of course, if you shrink government, large corporations get more powerful. Hence, there has been extensive corporate support for the Tea Party movement--most notably from Fox News, which has essentially turned itself into a propaganda organ for the Tea Party to a greater or lesser extent.",1

"""The most terrifying possibility since 9/11 has not been terrorism - as frightening as that is - but the prospect that Americans will give up their rights in pursuing the chimera of security"" - David K. Shipler

The thing that most people don't realize is that you cannot have 100% security alongside 100% liberty.  The only way to have 100% security is to live in a totalitarian state where the state is completely selfless.  Which will never happen.  

People who feel we should surrender more control and more power to the federal government have forgotten what principle this nation was founded on: liberty for all.  The constitution was specifically written to limit the powers of the federal government in order to protect the liberties of the people.  

Our government has strayed so far from this principle in the name of ""security"".  Bush passed the patriot act; the Obama administration actually had the balls to say that the fourth amendment was a ""hindrance"" to their interests.  

People say the justification is because the framers couldn't understand the level of modernization we would achieve.  That they couldn't expect things like the Internet, terrorism, airplanes, cell phones, etc.; so therefore they couldn't possibly understand the ""risks"" we live under.  

The thing to remember is that they didn't have to, because they did understand human nature, which never changes.  Yes, protecting the individual liberties of the people lowers our ""security"", but that was and is the Constitution's purpose.  

It was never meant to give limitless power and control to the federal government and anyone who says that it was is either purposefully trying to push this agenda, or has been completely fooled by the education system and mainstream media.  

Finally, this has nothing to do with bipartisanship either.  Both the left and the right want more centralized power in the federal government.  They make it seem for different reasons, like the liberals who feel the government knows better, and republicans who want to force the citizens to follow their idea of ""morals"".  The truth is, that more centralized power makes them RICHER.  

These days, neither party cares about liberty, safety, or morals, but rather the amount of money they can put into their pockets.  ",2

So I told him that I'm basically a pretty poor kid and I love tinkering with things and he happened to be a retired Navy captain.  He said ""you like being underwater then?""

I told him that I was happy for him suggesting that I move and start up a career instead of trying to pay bills with this dead end job.  He said ""No, it's just what I needed to do.  I need to educate someone from making the same mistake I did by joining the military way too late.""  Turns out he had some poor job that didn't net him very much money either.  That was a 2 hour and 49 minute call, my shift is only 7 hours.  That was a good portion of my day.

He told me not to focus on Space, but look into exploring and maintaining our own planet because that'll be more important in the future and by the time we find anything interesting in space it wouldn't be much longer until we all start dieing or our planet falls apart and we'd have to relocate.

i life in MA. the state teachers and state employees pay into the state retirement plan. i know this is as fact because of my sister &amp; my friends who are teachers and because i also briefly worked for the state.

a $100K salary is entirely relevant based on location. a NYC teacher making $100K is hardly a wealthy one because the cost of housing is so ridiculously high. if it's San Fran or Chicago or even Boston, $100K is not a lot of money. and i love how you neglect to mention who makes the higher salaries. it's the principals, the school administrator, etc. who make that money. those are the people who have masters or PHDs or who have 20 years experience and worked their way up.

i'm a web developer. brand new developers make $30K-$40K to start. senior developers easily make $100k $125K or a little more. IT directors can get over $150K. so the upper end teacher salaries aren't ridiculously high. are you telling me that a school department head for a big city who has 20 years experience and a PHd in academic administration DOES NOT deserve $100K.

"&gt;One is either a police state or not. Because America doesn't fit the characteristic of an authoritarian police state makes it not a police state.

Well, who said that?

&gt;Which makes your statement a hyperbole

What statement of mine is a hyperbole? I never said America is a police state. It shows developement into a police state. Which is something *bad*. Which you can change *any time*. Which you should change by *changing the system*, because the system allows for easy corruption and biased (mis)education. Two birds one stone, etc.

&gt;He may have been heralded as one of the greatest presidents ever instead of the worst.

Well, he told people they can do it, lied about weapons of mass destruction and mispresented the threat to America AND the invaded country and people said ""Well, if that's the case, then go on and do it.""

Well yeah. If what he thought would have actually succeeded, he would be Herald. But that's the very difference between a Herald and a looser... and in this case a prophetic leader vs. another liar who did things for egocentrical goals.

&gt;So yes, people's opinion change about war. Or at least their threshold to accepting war.

No. The imagination that this war was as easy and useful as some people made it out to be which brought people into supporting it turned out to be a sever misestimation and after realizing it was a mistake people wanted it to stop.

I don't think most of supporters ever supported ""Well go over there and kill that many people!"".

&gt;That's exactly what we have.

WHAT?

&gt;Do you not realize that we have a congress and a senate that has viewpoints that range from Michelle Bachmann to Dennis Kucinich to Ron Paul to John Kerry?

The way I see it people decide between two puppet parties and one wins, gets to be president for 4 years and dominates what's going on AND (more importantly) public interaction and representation.

&gt;And do you not realize that Obama has people working with him from the left wing and rightwing?

Well, were are all the other people? Most importantly: Where are the liberals?

Why is Obama in the position he is in? A representative that represents his own party? Monarchy much? 

Why does one politician earn more money than another policitian?

Why does one politician spend more money on campaigning than another politician?

Seriously, what we now have resembles a political equilibrium and provides unbiased education? The current system minimizes corruption and egocentric bias? Are you kidding me?



&gt;It just sounds like you want everyone to have your views, but you don't understand that there is a large part of America that is pro-war on drugs and anti-gay marriage.

So?

What does that matter? These people vote their politicians and then things get discussed. If what they want doesn't provide for a good government, they earn less money, easy as that! Nobody cares!

No politician would campaign against gay marriage if he wouldn't get any benefits from it. When all politicians earn the same amount of money, political campaigning is solely based on liberal political education instead of trying to get people to vote for a specific thing, then things would get better. 

The current system provides that? Seriously? Just no.

&gt;We're far from stagnant. 

Aha?

&gt;Every four years, we hold presidential elections for a new administration. 

So?

You go on explaining how the current system works. The system itself is still stagnant. 

America has two dominant parties. There is no collaboration of the two. Politicians power is partly determined by biased campaigning and how much money they get paid by companies.

&gt;it's trying to be realistic about our situation

Ther current situation is far from perfect and could be far better.

&gt;People like to portray America in such a negative light that make it seem like an authoritarian state when it is unequivocally not.

Well, that's really just your opinion.

When the top 2% earn 90% of property and monetary reserves, that's really a quite pathetic state and says nothing but that this state is dominated by *few* handling the *masses*.

&gt;The time probably will come, but it is not close, things have to get much worse fundamentally before that occurs. 

You mean like a state slowly developing universal public observation, causing unnecessary/unwanted inconvenience or even diminishing their rights for ""public security"" and having an incredibly intransparent government... oh wait, we already have that.

You mean... like a state where you can only decide between two major parties, both of which are basically the same just with a different name, completely disregarding political diversity in the general population and having absolutely no liberal option, noth parties always blaming the other one, agitating the public to have a meaningless battle and think they do something when voting against the ""enemy""... oh wait, we already have that.

You mean... like a state in which politics can be influenced by companies so that the few already in power can continuously keep their position completely acting against what would be best for everyone... oh wait, we already have that.

You mean... like a state in which the public gets influenced by corrupt politicians campaigning for votes and money and therefore power, who lead them like sheep to do what the corporations who finance the campaigns want instead of providing unbiased political education organized by ALL parties in a joined effort... oh wait, we already have that.

Come on, don't tell me there isn't already enough that's bad about this country. And don't tell me change is only due when shit hits the fan.

&gt;but there's nothing wrong with slow and steady either.

Well, how do you change a political system slowly and steadily?

You can easier use a system... or you don't use the system but use another one. 

What do you suggest?

&gt;It takes time for viewpoints to change and you can't force it on other people even if their views don't agree with yours.

There are *a lot* of people unsatisfied with the current situation. It won't change as long as people in power are able and allowed to exert power. Money buys opinion in this country. Authority influences opinion in this country. People don't really think much and they are severely under- and/or miseducated. This system won't EVER change because those in power are absolutely satisfied with it and the majority of people has a life that's satisfying but could be WAY better. They don't realize what's wrong as long as there is biased campaigning and they get their bread and games.",1

He ended up hugging us and all this stuff, but security was not too keen on it so they asked us to move. 

Obama climbs up on the bleachers to take a picture with the band. Security ends up pushing me to move on the other side of the barricade (not hard, but it was crowded), and I fell forward.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/23/AR2011022303232.html

&gt;Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama deserve some credit for what has happened. Bush put the problem of the Middle East's politics at the center of American foreign policy. His articulation of a ""freedom agenda"" for the Middle East was a powerful and essential shift in American foreign policy (as I wrote at the time). But because so many of Bush's policies were unpopular in the region, and seen by many Arabs as ""anti-Arab,"" it became easy to discredit democracy as an imperial plot. In 2005, Hosni Mubarak effectively silenced a vigorous pro-democracy movement by linking it to Bush.
&gt;Obama has had a quieter approach, supporting freedom but insisting that the United States did not intend to impose it on anyone. As unsatisfying as this might have been as public rhetoric, it has had the effect of allowing the Arab revolts of 2011 to be wholly owned by Arabs. This is no small matter, because the success of these protests hinges on whether they will be seen as organic, indigenous, national movements.


Although he gives credit to Bush for bringing up democracy, it's pretty clear that Bush did more harm than good by allowing himself to be painted as (and actually acting as) an anti-arab scapegoat.

"Offhand, and with no hard data to back it up, I would say that I've seen far more anecdotal examples of lost civil liberties since Obama and the Democratic Congress were elected. The Police in Michigan slurping the info from your smartphone without a warrant jumps to mind immediately. (MI is a pretty liberal/Dem leaning state I believe) Then you have the TSA's ridiculous current policies that seem to get more intrusive by the minute regardless of public outcry (or lack of effectiveness). 

And for all its early talk of transparency, the Obama administration has been far from transparent, even relative to the Bush Admin, and this seems to only get minimal coverage. 

Like I said, this is off the top of my head, but I definitely haven't seen any increase in civil liberties under the Democrats... far from it. I see more Government intrusion into everyone's life on a daily basis, and plans for more in the works. 

Not all Democrats are Socialists, but I would bet that most Socialists (here) vote Democrat. 

History says Socialism, for all its theoretical merit (it has some), has never been shy about putting its fingers in people's pies. It's also never been especially effective in practice either. Think of economically successful Socialist countries and examine their civil rights records. There are some exceptions of course, but they are often smaller countries not comparable to a country as large or complex/diverse as the US. 

Also, many of the ill advised ""crackdowns"" by the Republicans were a knee jerk response to a pretty significant act of terrorism on American soil, and both the people and their representatives (of all political leanings in many cases) were pretty easy to convince in that climate.

"First of all, its not Obama's healthcare reform. He just happened to be president when it was passed. Republicans waged a media blitz that attached his name to it in case anything bad ever comes out of it. The truth is that it was amended, agreed to and passed by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats. 

Prior to the universal healthcare reform, someone with no insurance was referred to the state's health insurance program called Medicare/Medicaid. You are either approved or not based on financial ability to pay. This has not changed and happens in the majority of cases where someone is unable to pay.

The new regulation is more of a rule that ended common practices by many insurance companies. These companies can no longer deny someone healthcare coverage based on a previous documented case that may or may not involve a terminal illness. Prior to this many people with illnesses or previous injuries had been dropped by insurance companies because the company was losing money on them. They were then unable to get any coverage from any other insurance company because their medical record showed a prior condition that the new company did not want to have to pay for. 

The system is still broken, its just a little less balanced entirely in the insurance company's favor.

Sunni Muslims are the most dangerous. Shiites are better.

I hate people that go on snotty anti-U.S. ""obese Walmart redneck hicks"" tirades. Sure, the U.S. has had some awful administrations and presidents (heck, I can't remember the last good combo), but everything that the U.S. stands for is pure good.

I think the desire to cosplay is an illness and I find most cosplayers disgusting. I don't know why dressing up as a fictional big-titted Japanese schoolgirl turns male neckbeards on but its creepy.

I think the U.S. right now needs to trash its financial sector, throw all these Goldman-Sachs/AIG/Lehman brothers ex-CEOs and whatnot (who all hold positions in Obama's economic advisory team) in fucking jail, or actually straight up execute them, and make a return to manufacturing and ingenuity (maybe support the U.S.'s already strong IT sector). They should rent out some of their states to China for a few years for enormous sums of money to eliminate their debt. A world without the U.S. in charge will suck.

For those Canadians who don't believe it, take a look at the number of Harpers inner circle who have close ties to organizations of far right wing attitudes, ideals and of a fundamentalist nature, (insert Christian fundamentalists here).

Until recently Harper has lead Canada via a minority government. Harper had been smart enough not to rock the boat and start voicing his personal opinions and implementing his personal agenda on issues like abortion and family planning because of this. More recently, (as a majority government) he has passed legislation to move Canada towards a stance of less tolerance towards drug use and much tougher laws which will lead to more of the population being criminalized for what many perceive to be societal issues. His most recent budget backs this position by allocating billions of more dollars for the building and the manning of more prisons.

For me there is a great deal of concern that we may be heading down a road of no return. From what I have seen it is rare that legislation passed and laws implemented by previous administrations are reversed by newly elected supposedly more liberal thinking parties even when in a clear position to easily do so, (see the 1st two years of Obama in office).

Our banking laws here are significantly different, as are our laws concerning lobbying and political contributions both corporate and private, but we still feel it when the U.S rolls over in its sleep. In addition we realize that all it takes is a massaging of the Acts currently in place legislating these above mentioned industries, which could allow them the type of control over our political system as seen south of us by these industries.
 
Harper is beside himself trying to ingratiate Canada to whoever is in power south of the 49th, as seen in the Conservatives knuckling under to revising our copyright laws to fall more in line with the MPAA and RIAA lobby in the USA.

"Around the time that Obama was born, people did. My father (60, grew up in NC) says when he was growing up, having an interracial child was shameful. There is still a legacy of racism in the South, particularly among older generations. Even among younger generations of blacks there are some who are multiracial but primarily identify as black. When I worked for the census I met people who were only a few shades darker than me (and I am quite pale) who self-identified as black and only black. ",1

"I was okay with the level of spending until about 2007. At that point I figured we had more than done our job in both wars. Funny note about Medicare part D, it was in fact the only healthcare reform that ended up being cheaper than estimations. Anyway, in the 2008 election I had to deal with a bunch of uneducated high schoolers who thought that Obama was going to save the world. In a sick way I'm glad that they idolized him and put their full faith and credit in him. It may teach my generation a lesson about dreaming versus reality. They grew up hearing all of the Bush hatred, and most of them didn't understand that his reputation was being blown out of proportion. I'm sad that Fox has demonized Obama. I'm also sad that Obama has tried to blame the Republicans for our current economic situation.

Don't make a promise you can't keep. Don't believe that somebody can just come along and solve all your problems. The executive branch is far less important than you think it is. 

I'm glad to hear someone like you actually commenting without a hint of anger or ignorance. It makes me feel like the political climate may actually get better.",1

"First of all, you're not talking about the government ""making"" you buy a specific car or insurance plan. You're talking about the government incentivizing one choice or another with a tax break or tax penalty, just like it taxes cigarettes to reduce people's cigarette consumption and gives a tax break on home mortgage interest to increase people's incentives to own a home. If someone proposes a law to throw people in jail for not buying a green car, then maybe we could talk about tyranny, but that's not what's happening and it's not going to happen.

The reality is that we have a robust system of civil liberties in this country, and also a roughly democratically elected representative government. The decision to tax one thing and not something else is not jackbooted fascism, it's simply good policy (when it's done right)--the shaping of people's incentives so that, on the whole, everyone benefits. If you or the OP are one of those people who believes any kind of taxation at all is a form of theft and the most heinous incursion on human rights imaginable, well, there's no arguing with you. But sane people can recognize that it's entirely appropriate for a government to make decisions about which kinds of behavior are most conducive to overall prosperity and freedom and take steps to encourage those behaviors, and that this is not something that's just started happening since Obama was elected.",0

He's also raised an amazing family and he has done all this with no help, on his own, his mother dead, his father gone. He is the American Dream if there is one and you can ignore that at your will.

That makes Mexico much more richer than Indian than America is richer than Mexico. So, yeah, I may not have seen them, but I can make an informed opinion based on numbers and related facts. 

And on my side, I have seen the poverty of an Indian village. Middle class, the term, is not very well defined, but I know that apart from the top 2-5% of Indians, rest of them live quite poor lives. This is not true for America. 

&gt; Don't throw the Americans are rich statement around because it isn't fucking true.

No. You have to look at the world globally, to get a real perspective.  In that perspective, Americans are definitely rich. 

At the end of the day, your poor Americans are in the same boat as the poor Indians. Who are the poorest Americans? The black Americans and the native Americans. They were stuffed by European colonialism just as Indians were [stuffed by it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943). 

And what was European colonialism but the domination of the [Elites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria) of Europe? And these elites are today represented by your Republicans. And when Obama talks about Indians stealing American jobs, he is paying heed to his Elitist anglo blood than to his Negro one, metaphorically speaking.

If anything, Obamas presidency has showed me how deeply twisted and corrupt the american political system is. Not saying that my goverment is perfect(far from it), but at least they are not completely owned by lobby groups and corporate interests. The wealth is being redistributed in here too, its moving from the hands of normal people to the big banks and corporations, but it´s not as bad as in the USA. 

For me, it looks like someone is trying to bring america down, and they are succeeding. Its sad to see normal american people getting pissed on by corporations and special interest groups. I hoped this trend would change when Obama was elected, but it seems like it´s only getting worse.

Even the Dems hate him now: 



&gt;As one Democratic senator complained: “The president veers between talking like a peevish professor and a scolding parent.” (Not to mention a jilted lover.) Another moaned: “We are watching him turn into Jimmy Carter right before our eyes.”

"There are only two that i particularly remember.

One was a voicemail Obama left for Chuck (whom i just looked up, his names actually Jeff. oops. I still visualized him and the president sitting together with a laptop) between his election and inauguration in January. He was calling to offer Jeff the job as ambassador. He starts the message with ""Hey Jeff it's Barack. (long pause) Obama.""

The other was about Jeff's mom. Apparently by calling in a favor Jeff got her into one of those fundraisers where you have to contribute to the campaign if you want to attend. She walked in, and stood in the seating area about 5 feet from the spot she knew Obama would speak from. When he asked for questions she raised her hand and said ""Mr. Obama i don't actually have a question i just wanted to say i'm Jeff's mother""

Apparently months later as Obama was being whisked off somewhere by his guards he saw Jeff from a distance and shouted ""Hey Jeff! I met your mom!""",11

"Switzerland

Well, it was in our newspapers this evening (I read it first on reddit since the morning newspaper didn't catch the news). The internet images were funny..

However at the job nobody talked about it. I was wondering if they even heard the news (maybe there will be talk of it tomorrow). In the evening I talked to a friend about how weird it is the body was disposed of so quickly.

I can't say I'm happy or relieved or anything. I was wondering about the domestic implications in the US and me and my friends pretty much decided that Obama is now unstoppable. My first comment on it was: ""How will the Americans scare their people with now?"" It's pretty much clear that there will be no change in US foreign policy so yeah... kinda irrelevant for me if he still lives or not.

"&gt; however, I wonder if the masses actually understand his economic concepts.

I have a business degree, and I would say that I have only a general understanding of the ""megamacro"" economic principals outlined by Ron Paul or anyone else for that matter. If I want to learn something new about economics, which I often do, I need to take the time to research it myself, as the mainstream media certainly will not inform me. Since I enjoy this type of thing, I am happy to do the reading and put in the extra effort. I am most likely in a very, very small minority of Americans who *really* try to understand what is going on with domestic fiscal policy of the world economy as a whole. And again, I do not claim to be an expert in this field, nor do I have time to be.

Sadly, when I was young, I ignorantly thought that politicians and economists (such as Greenspan) were the best of the brightest and I, as a layperson didn't necessarily need to concern myself with their infallible decision making skills. Now I know how wrong I was. Again, I believe most Americans simply put trust in their leaders to do the right thing and do not realize that most congress people, senators or presidents also do not have a great deal more economic knowledge than their ECON101 professor (assuming they ever had one to begin with).

Changing topics, I don't believe there is a shortage of jobs at all, at least in most parts of the country. There is a shortage of sufficiently motivated workers for sure. As in a lot of advanced countries, there are certain jobs that most Americans will not do. Farm labor comes to mind. In this entitlement minded society, we shall never live to match our means. Having lived overseas (SE Asia) for the past four years, I have become very familiar with people making due with $200 and still surviving in whatever way they can.

Going back to Paul, I just don't feel as though he's the front-man. Why couldn't have Obama put Paul or someone with his ideals in charge of the Fed, rather than the establishment choice of Geithner? Or at least make him some kind of special economic adviser? As a CEO, I know what I am good at and what I am not. CEO Paul is not the guy you want talking to Wall Street, but you DO want him in your board room.",1

"&gt;Do you feel that the president or Congress have failed more overall 

I think this is a fairly useless question, not to sound insulting, and trying to play the ""who is more at fault"" game is a large part of why we are in the messes that we are in.

I think Obama failed to live up to direct and actionable promises more than Congress, who never once made any promises that they weren't going to continue to be horrible.

He spoke frequently about financial reforms and regulating the same people that put us into the hole we're in. in fact, that is the issue that people cared about most, and he acted like he was tough on this issue. Not to mention the promise for Health Care he and Nancy Pelosi guaranteed well into his presidency as the bare minimum they would except in negotiations with republicans- AND THIS IS WHEN DEMOCRATS HAS THE EFFING MAJORITY AND HE HAD A MANDATE VICTORY. Oh and Guatanamo Bay is still wide open and torturing whoever they fancy without the practice of habeus corpus. And how about giving billions of taxpayer dollars to people that created the financial disaster restoring a now booming market while the rest of millions of working class Americans still can't find a job.

"You might get a few points on the application, but not a whole lot. Schools are more likely to look and see if your high school is in a disadvantaged area. 

They probably wouldn't be able to call you on your bluff. Why? Not to Godwin the thread, but can you imagine a college ever putting out a chart like this:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Nuremberg_laws.jpg/800px-Nuremberg_laws.jpg

That is a chart from Nazi-era Germany. It was an official tool to figure out if someone was ""Jewish enough."" While a college using race in admissions is obviously nothing like the horrors of that era, the Nazis have forever tainted the idea of trying to objectively determine someone's race. Schools don't want to touch this topic with a ten foot pole.

Can you imagine a school trying to determine if someone is ""African American enough""? The truth is, there are very, very few African Americans with pure African ancestry. Most are probably recent immigrants or the children of recent immigrants. 

For centuries, anyone with any African ancestry was immediately classified as black/colored. The races were never separate. We've had centuries of interracial procreation. This was initially used for slavery and Jim Crow, but even afterwards cultural attitudes have remained. Look at Barack Obama. His mother was a white woman from Kansas and his father was an African immigrant. 50% ""black"" at best. Yet he is widely considered to be America's first African-American president.

A school can't put down rigid race definitions because to do so would inevitably exclude someone. Can you imagine the shit storm that would ensue if a person from a poor urban community, whose entire family identified as black, was denied college preference for not being ""black enough""?

So go ahead and put down ""black"" if you want. If they question it, just invent some ""family story"" about having some African ancestor in the distant past. Most likely, the school will give you whatever tiny brownie points you get for the African-American race designation and not pursue the matter further.

"I have always been moderately politically active and aware. Through out the years was unhappy with things both parties (and presidents) have done. 

But I could see that Nixon developing relationship with China was a good thing and a political coup. Before he was impeached he was working with Ted Kennedy and a couple of other Senators on a health care bill that makes Obama's look weak and pathetic. So, even though I didn't care for Nixon, he did not throw me into despair.

That pretty much started with Reagan... and got steadily worse. Even though I voted for Clinton and thought he did some good things, his contributions to our current fiscal crisis (revoking Glass Stegall) and undercutting parts of the social net (Workfare... what a fucking joke) were clearly intended to help line the pockets of Corporations (and Bankers)

By the time we got to the Dim Son I was at the point of despising the entire process. 

So, I'd say no... I don't think it's the norm. Most people I know weren't truly unhappy until it looked like we were moving into a two family succession system: Bushes and Clintons... forever.

I have to honestly say I think the GOP and the Democratic Party are equally to blame... for different reasons. My view now is that both parties have watered down their platforms and become so centrists that it is just one party with slightly different agendas.

I had an incredibly fleeting (microseconds) hope that the Tea Bagger movement would be a real grassroots effort at putting a wedge in between the 2. But, either it was astroturf to begin with or it quickly became that.

Tunisia really provided little strategic value to the U.S. It has no oil or regional strategic importance, and few Americans go there.

Egypt has been a strategic ally to the U.S. for a long time; the Red Sea itself and Suez Crisis dictate that, but also its influence in the Middle East is key. I may have missed it, but I did not hear Clinton state support for the protesters; rather, she supported the right to free assembly and called for calm on both sides. That subtle difference is key -- the U.S. is more than happy to have its governor remain in power.

"Don't worry kid I got you:

1) Occupy was founded by Emeril Lagasse in 1972. In his words, ""We need to just go up to washington and then, BAM, everything will get better!""

2) Over time, more and more students left college to join Occupy, leaving a relatively small number to attend college. Because the cost of college never changed, this drove per-student tuition up in California and other places. According to Lagasse, ""I regret that this occurred, I just started Occupy and then, BAM, all of the students showed up!""

3) Because so many people were arrested at Occupy rallies from the early 80s on, prisons were severely overcrowded, so corrupt government officials partnered with Motel 6 to try to ease the strain. However, they never actually sent any prisoners to the motels, they just paid the motel owners (their constituents) taxpayer money.

There are two vocab words it is time for you to learn:
Debt - debt is what you think it is, the sum of all the money borrowed, all the loans etc. Think of it as a big hole
Deficit - The yearly amount of the budget that the US gov is unable to cover, ie. you make 20 dollars today, and you spend 21. todays deficit would be 1 dollar. Think of the deficit as the individual shovel scoops (one per year) that the US Gov is digging their debt hole with.
We (US) haven't had a budget surplus (opposite of a deficit) for a while now, so raising the debt ceiling means that hole we have been digging with the yearly deficit can get a few shovel fulls deeper. The proposed plan by obama is increasing revenue, and reducing spending, so it is making the yearly deficit smaller, working towards eliminating it. in the mean time, our current deficit would dig a deeper debt hole than would not be ""prudent"" towards our credit rating.

debt ceiling helps until we can reach a surplus again",4

"&gt; Barack Obama ordered the assassination of an [enemy combatant]

There is no int'l legal nor constitutional category for a so-called enemy combatant. It is a fiction invented by Lincoln and helped that tyrant remove the right of US states to secede from the union.

How can Al-Awlaki possibly be considered a ""combatant"". He never wielded a Kalashnikov. He never built bombs. He was a propagandist, outraged at the US invasions of Muslim nations based on lies and the US killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians.

During WWII, when the US faced a *real* threat, did the US resort to ordering the assassination of [Axis Sally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Gillars) or [Tokyo Rose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Rose)? The idea is ludicrous.

But in our so-called war on terror, the corrupt US gov't needs enemies so it invents them. And in this war, propagandists are targets for the tyrants that run the US.

&gt; Our country's founding documents claim a right of life and due process under the law [within our own borders.]

Where does it say that? If you read them, you'll see that the rights we claim for ourselves -- such as the right to life -- apply to all of humanity. The claim that the founding fathers would allow tyranny by the US gov't outside our borders is a very weak one.

&gt; you're a moron.

"Well, I feel like the movement has several somewhat-conflicting purposes. One is the standard, petition-the-government-for-redress-of-grievences type protest, where the “grievances” are anything and everything that falls into the “financial control of government” category. And while they’ve raised national awareness of some issues, that aspect of the movement could theoretically benefit from better focus and leadership.

But the other main purpose of the movement is to serve as a non-heirarchical model of democracy (on the assumption that hierarchies are what give rise to the corruption and disempowerment the movement is protesting against). This aspect of the movement is largely invisible to anyone not actually participating in it, but to many of those involved it’s the most important part. These include people who’ve long ago given up on traditional politics and protests and such, but who are eager to participate in direct actions (like feeding the homeless or putting families in foreclosed homes) that bypass the government and put their ideas of “economic justice” into effect directly. For those people, achieving anything in terms of actions by Obama or Congress is beside the point.",1

"1) He produced his Birth Certificate (with official Hawaii stamps and everything) at the same time and in the same way as all candidates.  Crazy people just kept wanting him to produce different kinds of birth certificates.  The way you can tell it was all just dirty politics is that  McCain was born in Panama.  He doesn't appear to have been born in the Canal Zone and it's somewhat irrelevant.  At the time of McCain's birth, he was considered a citizen but not officially a native born American citizen.  He was made one retroactively by a law that was passed.  (Hey, why don't you make that a conspiracy.  Or, if it isn't political, ask Mitt Romney if he campaigned for his dad when he was running for President back in the day.  Papa Romney was straight up born in Mexico.)

2)  No they didn't.  His grandmother (or more precisely the woman who married his grandfather - he's not descended from her), not a native English speaker, said she was there (in Kenya) when he was born.  She continued on to say they received a letter and when the mean guy asking her all these questions wanted to visit Kenya for her to show him the hospital where Obama was born she said she couldn't because the hospital was in Hawaii.  She said all this in the same interview with the same guy.  Everyone just ignores whatever doesn't support the plot.  His actual grandma said he was born in Hawaii.  (Pretty sure she remembered it...white daughter, 1960's, black baby daddy... you know.)

3)So?  Moneygill Ireland played it up that Obama's distant ancestors were from there.  Imagine if it had been one of his parents.

4) Good for you.  You should check with your state's relevant agency to see how many people have to get replacements each year.

Why is it that people have an easy time believing that a pregnant college student would use sparse funds to fly to Kenya to give birth, leave no trail, plant fake birth announcements in Hawaii newpapers and manage to sneak an infant back into the United States (and not over one of those ""walk across"" boarders either!) and obtain documents believable enough to **obtain a passport** for her child?  With no evidence of any of that?

Why does that make a difference? I see this being out there by Conservatives and shake my head. Again, just because he was an ally that gives him the right to destroy his populace? Or that makes it ok to commit atrocities? Bush shifted, Obama shifted. I don't think that's anything more than a red herring on the issue. 

&gt;Human rights, yeah right, a lackluster excuse used long after all these main points were found to be utter lies and fabrications.

I've followed the argument. It was not the ** primary ** reason, agreed but it certainly wasn't ""lacluster"". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Anfal_Campaign

&gt;They never shelled cities indiscriminately, they never mowed down entire crowds with choppers and jets. There is a difference between full on indiscriminate killing of civilians and power control, or what I called regime/governmental self-preservation. Libya crossed that line as soon as it used its' military indiscriminately.

Ok, so as long as snipers are picking off civilians, and motorcyclists are running people with machine guns then this is your gauge for intervention? No shelling? Regardless that these are still regime forces?
And this debate is not whether YOU support intervention, the thread started out as the differences in coverages and lack of anti-war protests as NPR (legitimate source for you, I hope?) [indicated](http://www.npr.org/2011/04/15/135391188/whatever-happened-to-the-anti-war-movement): 

&gt;But it's just not the same. Now and then, small pockets of protesters still band together. On March 19, for instance, about 100 demonstrators — anti-war protesters marking the eighth anniversary of U.S. military involvement in Iraq — were arrested outside the White House.

&gt;""It's a far cry from the Bush years, when hundreds of thousands or millions marched against the war,"" David Boaz, executive vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute, writes on the Britannica website. He asks the same question: Whatever happened to the anti-war movement?

&gt;In the post, he points out that American protests against wars seemed to stop the moment Barack Obama was elected president in 2008. ""Maybe anti-war organizers assumed that they had elected the man who would stop the war,"" he observes.

&gt;But the wars have continued. More than two-thirds of Americans have opposed military intervention in Libya, Boaz reports, and nearly two-thirds of Americans — a number that is up dramatically since early 2010 — believe the war in Afghanistan hasn't been worth fighting. ""Where are their leaders?"" Boaz wants to know. ""Where are the senators pushing for withdrawal? Where are the organizations?""

&gt;He concludes that the anti-war activity in the United States — and around the world — a few years ago ""was driven as much by antipathy to George W. Bush as by actual opposition to war and intervention.""

&gt;To buttress his assertions, Boaz cites a recently published study of anti-war protesters. The research was conducted by Michael Heaney of the University of Michigan and Fabio Rojas of Indiana University. ** It concludes that the anti-war movement in America evaporated because Democrats — inspired to protest by their anti-Republican feelings — stopped protesting once the Democratic Party achieved success in Congress in 2006 and then in the White House in 2008** .

"Also, people who assume disagreeing with Obama makes me racist.",1
"&gt; Gypsy is a racist term as is kike, wop, dago, or nigger.

Just in case you didn't know, they call themselves gitanos. They say that you're either a ""gitano"" or a ""payo"", ""gitano"" being a good thing and ""payo"" being kind of an ""inferior"" thing. You have to be aware that words might have different connotations in different languages. ""Gitano"" is not, by any means, a racist term here. They're proud of that word, and I don't see anything wrong with it either. It's also used to describe certain kinds of music, poetry, dance, etc.

&gt; You don't know the conditions under which the kid left school.

No, but what happened in that particular case is completely irrelevant. What *is* relevant is that [80% of gypsies in Spain leave school when they're between 12 and 15 years old](http://www.heraldo.es/noticias/el_los_jovenes_gitanos_abandonan_escuela_secundaria.html). You can now claim that my case was an exception again, and maybe it was, but that's not the point.

Just in case you didn't know, and as you can read in that article (which popped up in the first Google search I performed), politicians insist again and again in telling **gypsies' parents** to **not pull their children out of school**. Do you know why they insist so much in that? Because they **know that's the reason those kids leave school**.

And do you know why they find difficulties to find a job if they later want to? Because of **the same reason** that any guy who didn't finish high school: lack of formation. That's the way their parents tie them to the ""family"". They pull them out of school soon enough, knowing that they'd later have no other choice but to do ""what we've always done for a living"".

The article I linked points this out and shows some of the public efforts politicians are trying to make to revert the situation.

From the article:

&gt; Alcober has asked these families to ""take advantage"" of the public educative resources and do an ""important effort"" for their children's education. About this subject, she added that ""access to education is not discriminated in our current society, but when somebody leaves this road he/she is discriminating him/herself"".

&gt; [...] Furthermore, general director of Educative Politics in Aragón has stated that teachers and educators find difficulties in their task to achieve the full scholarization of gypsy children because they can't contact with their families. ""It's difficult -he emphasized- that we can work with these kids if we find difficulties to contact the families and make them understand that if the solution to everything is in school, kids don't have a chance if they don't go to school"".


&gt; [...] Pinos has insisted on the necessity for young gypsies to complete their secondary studies [until 16 years old], which is the reason why he asked their families ""not to leave us teachers and politicians alone, because our sensation of failure is huge right now"".

Also, in that article they point out that while male gypsy kids usually start secondary school and leave before they finish it, **girls usually never start secondary school**. Their families being as conservative and traditional as they are, they decide that the girls' place is in the kitchen and taking care of the house and the children, so **they don't even allow them to go to school anymore** when they turn about 12.

&gt; Again, you absolve yourself and your society of any responsibility for putting the Romani where they are.

And again, you're putting words in my mouth that I never said. I never said that our ancestors weren't responsible for their situation, maybe they were.

But if we keep hating each other for things that happened in the past and refuse to talk to each other, things will never get solved. Jews don't hate Angela Merkel because of the Nazism, Japanese don't hate Obama because of Hiroshima. The past is there to learn from it, not to stick to it. Currently, and I reiterate it, gypsies have all the necessary means to do whatever they want. As I said, it all starts when they're children and they're in school. If their parents not only refuse to take them to school, but **take it as an offense** that society tries to take their children to school because they want them working with the family, there's very little that can be done.

I don't think you're very familiar with the situation of gypsies in Spain, and I suspect it's very different from other gypsy communities in Europe, although I can't tell.

I know I have only had good intentions towards every single one of them I've ever met, and treated them like I would treat any other human. And all I've seen from society were also good intentions and attempts to integrate them without damaging their own culture at all, which is, in itself, a beautiful and rich culture that needs to be preserved. So no, I don't feel ""guilty"" if you want to call it that. Also, I have my hands extended for anyone who wants help. I've always been this way. But it's very hard to help someone who: 1-Never asks for help. 2-If you try to offer him help, takes an offense for it.

**Edit:** Also, in the [antiziganism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiziganism) article you linked, there's not a single mention about Spain or Spanish ""gitanos"".

**Edit 2:** I found [another interesting article](http://www.diariodeleon.es/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=308499) about the conditions in which gypsies leave school.

It first talks about the percentages of gypsies leaving school compared to non-gypsy kids, then adds:

&gt; [...] But there is almost no difference between gypsy and non-gypsy kids when they state that they're happy in their educative center (83,1% of non-gypsies against 81,6% of gypsies).

&gt; [...] Most of the interviewed gypsies, **82%, say that they openly talk with their classmates about their belonging to the gypsy community**, while the rest say they prefer to hide it.",38

"Me and my buddy drop this story every time we meet a new person and like them almost instantly. 

A cold English autumn night. The middle of the country. I and six others had gone to a small countryside music folk festival because we hadn't seen each other in a while and wanted to enjoy some music and get buzzed. One of us (we'll call him Joey....because that's his name) had just got back from New York after a month and hadn't been able to drink (he was only 19 at the time).
Now, when me and Joey get together, we like to get pretty wasted but because his tolerance levels were down, he went pretty quickly. At one point he was walking round with four glasses of red wine, spilling it everywhere and trying to drink from each one at the same time. He tackled me from once end of the dancefloor to the other and was starting to get pretty lairy.
When the music ended, it must have been about midnight and we made our way down this dark country lane with woods either side that contained nothing but pure blackness. Joey was standing in front of cars and making an ass out of himself when it started pouring with rain and I mean absolutely chucking it down. I was laughing and egging him on like an idiot when he suddenly ran off into the darkness of this path and disappeared. We all thought he had gone for a cheeky piss or was planning to jump out at us but when we reached the bottom of the road, he still hadn't turned up.
After running to the bottom of the hill to tell my dad Joey was missing (I slipped and almost broke my ankle in front of the car), he convinced me to go look for Joey (""But dad, he'll be fine, its Joey!"")
After walking up and down for about ten minute shouting his name, me and my friend Dan heard a ""urgghh, arggh"" from behind one of the walls, in the forest. Now things get interesting.
Dan found Joey hung upside down by one of his feet and he immediately started saying ""Get the knife out! Get it out!"" We had no idea what he was talking about and Dan, freaked out, broke the branch and sent Joey tumbling into the forest. I, being second drunkest after Joe, jumped over the wall and made my way over through the forest, scratching myself on branches, scrambling across the fairly steep incline. When I reached him, I ended up being there for about an hour and a half, holding his hand, getting poured on by rain and being stung by nettle leaves all over my body. Joey was shouting thins like ""Sting lip!"" and ""My Obama shirt is ruined"".
Two fire engines and two ambulances turned up to rescue him after a long long time and just when the firemen brought him out, a wasp landed on my arm and stung me. He turned to me and said ""Its swarming down there"" and we realised that when Joey had fallen, he had dropped onto a wasps nest which had then proceeded to sting the shit out of us. We hadnt been able to see or hear them because of the rain and dark.
After taking Joey home (he refused to go to hospital) I counted the stings and had over 40 from my neck down. I threw up violently the next day. So did Joey.

TL:DR -- My drunk friend somehow got his foot trapped in a branch and when he got let free, fell on a wasps nest. After going to help him, I got attacked by a hive and got pretty fucked up.",19

Their names are protected by law. In fact, many laws even prevent keeping numbers so we have accurate statistics.

&gt; Insanity or dwpression on the mother's part is not a legal reason to abort after the age of viability (24 weeks).

That's not how the law works. It's vague. And the doctors involved know that if someone does notice it happening, it's quite easy to have the pro-choicers sicced on anyone that says anything. Though they tend for discretion just because it's easier. Any pregnancy that is dangerous to the mother's health is fair game, and it's not defined any more specifically than that.

Bullshit. The headlines would blare ""Ignorant pro-lifers try to illegally revoke the license of one of the few doctors willing to protect poor women who only want to exercise their rights"".

"1. I'd say its because alot of people just highly enjoy where they are, and their family has deep roots and they are happy. The us also has quite alot of very nice national parks, and amusement parks which americans love as well. Also with as big a country as this is, we have alot of different biomes. We have deserts in nevada, mountains that are so rocky, big forests in new england, and of course all manner of shore lines and beaches.

2. I would say this is not entirely true, though I would imagine alot has to do with how much we sue ppl. While not common, there are definitely those out there who would sue for sexual harrasment if you did nothing more than say ""damn bitch has a nice ass""

3. There aren't. Its a cultural stereotype stemming from slavery which was not fully agreed upon to abolish. MANY people in the south still completely view non-caucasion people (and women) as inferior creatures. To appease this and make more money, the media much prefers to show a black guy being thrown to the ground and handcuffed.

4. Same reason why anyone would view an outside negative comment as hostile. When talking with other americans, they are in the exact same boat, so they are obviously discussing how to improve. When talking to an outsider, while they may be trying to help, a much larger number of bad options arrive, such as ""why would you stupid ppl do that"" ""haha your in deep shit"" ""god I hate you for being so reckless"" ""its all your fault"".

5. Because people much prefer to hear about how great they are than to hear about how great other people are.

6. The american dream is just an idea, that a person can start with nothing and still be anything. It will always exist. The thing that changes is the attainability and likelyhood that the dream can be attained. You obviously have to work for it, and you also need a fair bit of luck as well, but its still happening.
