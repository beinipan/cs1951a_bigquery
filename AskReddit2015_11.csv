"Ehh...I felt that way at first too. But I have had the misfortune of meeting two people who I think are compulsive liars (and I've spoken with others who have expressed similar thoughts regarding these individuals), who started out harmless but have become much less so over time. 

I say I felt that way at first, because while their lies were somewhat tame and often ridiculous, they weren't really hurting anyone or anything other than their credibility. And even then, a lot of people believed their shit. 

But recently, I caught one of the them telling a lie about me doing my (previous) job poorly. It's one thing when they're telling lies about themselves, but when they tell lies about other people just to tell an interesting story...that crosses the line, as a lie like that can have strong effects. Especially when it's about someone's career or character. 

And the other person I know, who previously claimed she was unbelievably wealthy because her parents were high up in running the lottery system in some southern state or something along those lines, has recently begun posting all over Facebook that she's basically dying. And she's asking for $25,000 worth of donations to cover some obscure surgery that she's not willing to go in depth about, for a ""genetic spinal disease"" that she is also being extremely vague about. I don't doubt that she has medical issues, she objectively overweight and dropped out of school. But I don't think she's dying or in need of surgery. And it's obvious others feel the same way, as every post gets little to no comments, likes, or shares; and she's only received 19 donations which is 19 more than she deserves. She's essentially swindling money out of people who are compassionate, and from people may need it more than her or could have given the money to people who *do* actually need it more than her.

I don't know if it's something they can control or not, but when you start hurting others due to your lies, you need to find some way to control yourself. Unfortunately, these two people don't seem like they care for others very much anyway. I'm not sure if this is a trend among compulsive liars, but from my personal experience, it would appear so. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I just find these kind of people very annoying.

The thong was laying inside-out, crotch/taint/ass-side up and it appeared encrusted in shit.  I guess that explains why she kept going to the restroom. *shudder*",1

"Wow, this turned out a lot longer than I expected. You wanted details you got it, haha.

Sure thing. And I realize now that I was 17, I'll edit that in after this.

Anyways, I was in marching band in high school, and we were doing a car wash to raise money for a trip somewhere. We were out there for hours, and when we finished I was the dude left in charge of the cleanup (I had a leadership position, and I don't remember if I volunteered or drew the short straw). So the director and the other adults were gone, and it was me and maybe a dozen other kids who were either waiting for their for their parents to pick them up or we were going to hang out afterwards. 

So we're collecting all the buckets, signs, hoses, and everything, when this white van rolls in, with a logo on the side of a cross, a Bible, and some happy children on it, and the name of his organization above it (the something something Fellowship). We've still got a hose hooked up so I figure I can wring a few more dollars out of this man so I tell him we're just closing down but I can fit him in before we leave. The dude smiles at me under his big bushy beard and asks me if I've heard the Good News about Jesus Christ. So I say yeah, I'm Catholic, we're the original Christians, now would he like his van washed?

And the smile left his face faster than I'd ever seen before, and he started saying stuff angrily about did I know that the Catholic Church was a pagan institution, that we were idolaters and heathens and the devil that hides behind the cross. Now my grandfather left Ireland during their Civil War, and harbored anger towards exactly this sort of Protestant, and taught us ""to never let a Protestant crush us under their heels ever again"", so I told the man that as far as I was concerned he was the heretic, that he was not welcome to preach to me or my boys so he should get the hell out.

And he exploded and said that bit about Babylon and that he's commanded to fight evil wherever he finds it and to spread the Word and that if I got in his way he would make me regret it. Now he was bellowing and shaking his fists at this point so I backed up a couple steps and several of my boys came running over, about half of whom were gym rats (and one I later found out had a knife on him at the time, who didn't take it out thank God) and they're all gathered around me looking angrily at him. It was probably the combination of that and he saw one of the girls their on the phone saying something along the lines of ""there's this angry man here shouting at FitzGeraldisFitzGod"" (it was just her mom but it sounded like she could have been calling the police) that made him get back in his van, shouting about how were going to hell, and he drove off.

"it's understandable, those games aren't for everyone, and the world of fallout can seem bland at first so it's good to go into it with an open mind and patience. it's definitely a very different experience than most games. 

here's my advice for enjoying rpg games like bethesda games: 

if you enjoy more story driven linear gameplay with cutscenes, then focus on the main questline, and do sidequests if you feel like it or if you need to level up more to make some quests easier.

if you are more of a fan of customization aspects and character building, then just basically do what interests you. there are a lot of customization options and decisions in the game (settlement building, crafting and upgrading items, building up your skills/ perks, deciding to help, not help, or even be against basically any character in the game, finding and customizing companions, or even simple exploration. if you try to learn all at once it will overwhelm you.. it's better to just focus on the features that interest you, you'll have more fun that way and the other less interesting features will always be there if you want to try them out later.

these games aren't for everyone, but i think it's worth putting in some time to give it a chance. you slowly learn about features of the game as you play, and your views may or may not change as you progress through the world.",2

"The raising of consciousness. 

When a morally bankrupt system, like slavery, is what someone grows up knowing, they tend not to reflect on it in any meaningful way. Virtually no one in 1825 had your current understanding of what today's reality would look like.

When this new school of thinking was made aware to people back then, they could either ignore it, look for sources that back this old thinking, or reflect inward and have their consciousness raised.

Anti-slavery forces were growing in America like a smoldering barn fire. As younger people began to adopt this new way of thinking, it became part of the fabric of this new culture. Abraham Lincoln succeeded in raising the consciousness of the country.

We see the same things happening today with accepting refugees or allowing Arab speaking people in planes. 159 from now, thus kind of action will be understood for what it is. Right now it's seen as protecting the country.",2

"""Investing"" your money in quality items will save you money in the long run. Up to a certain extent, paying extra for an item usually means you get a higher quality item which will last you longer and which will retain its value.

If you buy a table or a lamp at IKEA, it will lose almost half its value as soon as it's un-boxed, and then the worth will continue to drop as it's worn over the years. IKEA tables and lamps are of 'Ok' quality, but wont last a lifetime and will go out of fashion. Alternatively, if you buy a quality designer lamp or table from a carpenter, you will (often) get an item which will last a lifetime and which will retain or even increase its value over the years.

This also applies to other things like clothing. Of course, if you buy a pair of Nike shoes or a fashionable printed t-shirt, this isn't the case. But if you buy a moderately expensive pair of leather shoes, a nice shirt, etc, with proper care these items can last for many years and stay in fashion.",2

"Even being in the military is pretty similar. Few see direct combat, and among those who do it is often for a short while, there is only a pretty small bracket of people who are exposed to repeated combat. ",1
"Of course there aren't any groups trying to enact such legislation, as they'd be laughed out of any respectable government on Earth today. But change, both positive and negative, happens over time. Today, the idea of making certain opinions illegal is silly and far-fetched. But what about tomorrow? What about a year from now? A decade? A century? ",0

"Nothing I said was false. Only about one in three women who are raped is traumatized as a result of rape. This is reality. You'll notice that figure showing up in your own link.

Most people are resilient and bounce back from bad things happening to them.

You're more likely to hear about the ones who do not for obvious reasons.

The myth that all rape victims are traumatized for it is one of the major reasons that many rapists get away with rape - because their victims ""aren't acting right"", because people have the stereotypical idea that rape victims are all broken by the experience. This is wrong.

Indeed, it is probable that this actually makes things worse for rape victims. If you tell people that they're supposed to be messed up by something, they're more likely to be messed up by it.

So, way to contribute to people getting away with rape, and not believing people who aren't messed up by the experience.

And you call ME trash.",1
"Did he look like this? [Amateur Sketch](http://cdn.rsvlts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/leprechaun.jpg)  - If so, that's the guy.",6
"nah, that's fine you see it that way, but I disagree. If his audience wasn't watching him, they'd just be shitposting and taking life advice from /b/ and /r/funny or some other shitty youtube channel instead, after all, they're just kids with internet access. Pewdiepie sets a positive example in comparison and provides lonely kids with a ""friend"" and ""community"" to participate in. Sure, they're annoying fans, but you think they'd be any less frustrating on the internet without him?",3

As I was reading this in class I just had a weird urge to put on my nonexistent seat belt at my desk. ,1
I'm the opposite...I am usually unable to talk about myself. ,1
"Oh, I absolutely agree with you! But my husband and I are both teachers, and we are both in grad school right now. New knives are on our wishlist, and I'm sure we will get some really good ones eventually, but right now we have things like school loans, veterinarian bills, and Christmas shopping to take care of first :) ",1

"My father is in the hospital probably dying. This is made complicated by the fact that I spent the first 20 years of my life having no contact with him. I already mourned the loss of him for almost all of my childhood. When I was 20, we met and he could act like a decent guy for the week or two I was around (I visited a few times) but he never fooled me and he knew that. Now we aemail each other about three times a year about dumb stuff. 

Now he's dying and I have no fucking clue how to feel about it. Part of me doesn't care, but I also know I keep my phone with me for updates and am checking out airfare, so I have to care some, right? 

The worst part is that if he pulls through and turns out fine, I'll be a little pissed because I got all worked up and into this issue and then it turned out to be nothing. I never caused him any trouble my entire life and he has caused so much for me. 

Eh. I'll get over it. ",2

oh,1
Most of the time I'm fine without drinking anything but every now and then I do have to give it an extra push with liquids. I cannot do sodas however. Carbonated drinks tend to mess me up even more. ,2
Just reading the post would lead you to realise it was a joke though. ,4
