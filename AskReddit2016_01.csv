I enjoy baking, so it was just some cookies or cupcakes here and there every once in awhile. At first, it wasn't a conscious effort, because I genuinely like to share, but one day, as I brought in a container of chocolate chip pumpkin muffins and everyone dove blindly for them, an evil thought slithered into my mind. I could get them to eat anything!

I continued as usual, bringing in all my leftover Christmas candy (no normal adult needs a whole stocking full! Every damn year this happens) Just to get everyone comfortable and unsuspecting. And then one day, a few weeks later, I struck. 
When no one was looking I casually went into the break room, stored my lunch in the fridge, and left a bowl of candy out for everyone to take a handful. Then I listened and waited for the yells of disgust as everyone grabbed a great big mouthful of M&amp;Ms... mixed with Skittels. I got 7 people at once. It was beautiful. ",458

I am masturbating since 3yrs. and at a rate of 1 to 2 times per two weeks average and I get hard erections during that but at the time of sex as soon as I put condom and try to insert my penis to her vagina, it gets softer and I can't insert it.

He does have several valid points, one of them is that he isn't a politician and isn't acting like one.

"Obviously antagonizing a police officer during a traffic stop by yelling ""Am I being detained? Am I free to go?"" isn't wise. Of course *any* kind of verbal exchange with an officer carries a little risk, but being silent or hostile will *probably* make your experience worse than just taking that small risk. However that doesn't mean you should strike up a friendly conversation either. Be polite, cooperative to the degree required of you but no further, and avoid answering any questions (that means politely refuse or skirt, not silently stare the officer down), or at least give non-commital, general answers. For example:    
  
""Do you know how fast you were going?"" - ""Yes I do"" will work, because it's not an admission of guilt. If he asks ""How fast?"" say something like ""I'm sure you have an opinion on that"".     
""Do you know why I stopped you this evening?"" - ""No""  
""Let me see your license and registration."" - ""Sure""  
""Where are you heading this fine evening?"" - ""I'd rather not discuss that, officer""  
""Do you mind if I take a look around your car?"" - ""I do not consent to any search of my vehicle"" (it's better to be very clear with that one)  
  
People wanting to explain themselves out of a situation is *not* a good idea. It's very likely you won't change the officer's mind, and worst case scenario you're just further incriminating yourself.  
  
As far as your last situation goes, a smile and a thank you is probably fine.

"So some idiot called /u/Bizor posted this comment: 
&gt;The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.

I made a  fucking reply to that but when I posted it, the comment was deleted and I'm not going to let my efforts go waste. So here is my reply:

&gt;People called the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band because of the sheer number of musicians they've influenced over the past 50 years. While there is no ""greatest"" in music because it's so subjective, the Beatles have been an influence to musicians in all genres. The jazz and classical musicians you mentioned were undoubtedly superior in technical skill, and were wonderful musicians in their own right, but they cannot be said to be more influential than the Beatles simply because the impact the Beatles have had on music as a whole is incomparable. 

&gt;While the accessibility and ""pop"" nature of their music plays a big part in that, their studio shenanigans with George Martin were innovative and groundbreaking at the time. More likely than not, John Coltrane influenced jazz musicians for the most part and perhaps a handful of musicians from other genres, but the Beatles have influenced a LOT more musicians in a much wider variety of genres. They excelled at pop music with their early albums, and then added so much more to their sound later, ranging from early heavy metal, acid rock, Indian classical, stuff like A Day in the Life which cannot even be categorised, amongst other stuff.

Edit: Ah fuck.

"TL;DR: Running away from cough medicine. I got 11 stitches.

     I had a really bad cough when I was around 9yrs old and my mom had been giving me some REALLY bad tasting medicine. It wasn't just the taste either; the smell of it made me gag uncontrollably. 
     Anyway, I decided I had enough and wasn't going to take the medicine anymore so when it was time for the next dosage I started running away and begging my mom not to give me any more of those meds. She, of course, chased me around the house (we are outside at this point) and I start climbing over the fence (about 6ft tall) that connects the neighbor's house to ours. Coincidentally, that fence is right next to a smaller, four foot arrowhead fence that I was using as a step to help me get down from the taller fence. I slipped and did a vertical split while landing on the neighbor's property. At first I didn't feel much pain and managed to carefully put my leg down because, in my mind, I had only bruised my leg which caused it to go numb. I walked back to my house to go to the bathroom and check on my ""bruise"". At this point, I don't know where my mom is because I lost her when I went over the fence. When I pulled my pants down to check on my leg, all I saw was meat. Pulsating, red, shredded meat that was poking out from a large gash on the inside part of my thigh. I pulled my pants up limped my way out of the bathroom to find my mom and tell her that I needed to go to the doctor (I guess my brain processed that it was worse than I initially thought and suddenly I wasn't able to walk normally). She almost fainted when I showed her and was crying hysterically so my neighbor had to drive us to the emergency room.  I got eleven stitches and a cool scar out of it. Moral of the story? Kids, just listen to your parents. 

Fun fact: This accident is what I blame for my interest in medicine and surgery. I still vividly remember the inside of my leg and I hope to never forget it.

"HARD ROCK CAFE: several years ago, I was brought on as a prep cook and actually enjoyed the position and the two coworkers I did the prep with. 

Near the end of the season, the managers switched me to dishpit without first consulting with me about if I was OK with it. They also switched me from mornings (we started at 7am, which I liked) to nights.

One day, I came in for a shift and the first thing a manager had told me was how I had forgotten to put two dishes back on a shelf at the end of the previous night's shift.

I nodded, headed to my locker to suit up and that's when I made the snap decision to just walk right back out. This was on an August night when the street the HRC was on was closed to traffic for a street festival.

The manager who got on my case was forced to work dishpit that night and for the three next days until they could sneak a replacement in.

BTW, if you eat at the HRC, I can't begin to tell you how horribly unhealthy the food is.",374

"Sorry for the delay. I'm not too familiar with computer science and education, although I know Justine Cassell is working in that area. In terms of connecting machine learning and child language learning strategies, so far I haven't seen a big push on the computer science side toward using how children learn to improve machine learning - hence why I can get my PhD in that field! 

Aside from my papers, there is some work on studying how reference resolution (picking out an object in a scene that someone mentioned) proceeds and building a model to predict referring expressions. Deb Roy has a lot of work on this, and some other child language learning work (although more phonetic than semantic as in our work). You can start with his paper here: http://media.mit.edu/cogmac/publications/csl.pdf

Another good one you should be able to get through your school's library is this one, where the authors actually attach a camera to a kid's head to see how they look at things: Embodied Active Vision in Language Learning and Grounding (Chen Yu).

Another good one for joint attention (a key part of child language learning) is this one: Investigating joint attention mechanisms through spoken human-robot interaction (Staudte and Crocker, 2011).

However, most of these papers are towards trying to understand how children learn, but not actually applying anything in machine learning. I think in general the idea in the field is that it's easy to collect a lot of data nowadays, so trying to learn from less data is not so important. But true learning from a computer is more than just building a classifier - if we want computers to be able to communicate with us, they'll need a deeper understanding of how language and the world works, and the best way (I think) to do that is to teach them through interaction the way we would teach a child.",2

"I'm not presently learning a language, but the for the languages I learned in the past:

French and Spanish were the only two languages taught at my school.  French was mandatory in 7th grade.  Then I switched to Spanish for 8th, 9th, and 10th grade (passed my Regents exam) and then went back to French for 11th and 12th (and passed a second language Regents exam) because I wanted to speak both and wanted the double-language on my high school transcripts to make up for the fact that my school was small and there weren't many ""extra"" classes available outside the core classes.

Also, while I was in school, my mother started losing her hearing and was learning ASL because they didn't know how far it would progress.  I learned the basic at the same time she did then, when I went to college, I coincidentally ended up a college with a large deaf population (RIT) and, since I had the basics, was often assigned to the primarily deaf dorms when I worked for Residence Life.  Combined with the fact that nearly every class I was in had deaf students meant I picked up a lot through the basic necessity of communicating with classmates.

Of course, that was all over 15 years ago.  Learned languages are like any skill: if you don't use them, they disappear.  Now, my ASL is nearly useless, my Spanish is horrible, and my French is barely passable.

I definitely regret not keeping up with them.",2

"My father was/is a Mormon. My grandfather was Mormon, grew up in Utah, and raised his family to be the stereotypical Mormon family. When I was born, my mother refused to have me baptized into the Mormon church, so I was baptized as Catholic, and I thank her for that to this day. Not too long ago, my mother and I had a talk about the religion and some incidents involving bishops and the church that occurred at the beginning of my mother and father's relationship. Hearing what happened really freaked me out, and talking with her about the church and what they believed really explained a lot of things about my father and his side of the family - everything started to make sense. Needless to say, it's a batshit crazy religion. Believing that magic undergarments will protect you from Satan, 10% of your annual income must go to the church, and that all of your assets are shared assets of the Mormon community is absolute nonsense. I remember distinctly when I was about 13 years old, I was watching South Park's episode about the Mormon religion and the insane things the church is based around (the episode was making the church a mockery and satirical victim) and my father stormed off because of the humor in the cartoon at the absurdity of the religion.

"One rule I had been taught was to have well defined rules/expectations and consequences/rewards in place before they need to be.  It makes it less of judgement call/revenge sort of thing, and more predictable for both parties.

A girl I dated in high school's dad had a simple rule: call if you need a ride or just want permission to spend the night.  If you drive home drunk, or if someone drunk drives you home, then he would take you out for a drive through the twisty mountain roads until you were heaving.  Then he'd turn around and drive back.  Fortunately he had a delivery truck that he could hose out.  Anyway, it only happened once.  After that, all of his kids were *really good* about knowing that their parents reaction would be.  Now, they weren't the model family by any means, but they turned out reasonably well.

In life we have to make judgements all the time about actions and consequences, driving drunk or not is pretty simple math, it gets a lot more complicated as we get more people depending on us.  If we learn to do the calculus, we're better off.  

Nature doesn't have rewards on punishments, only consequences.

"I am quite poor. My best friends, and their father, are also just as poor.

I want to study psychology once I get my health in order.

One of them wants to study psychology once her job at Maccas isn't paying for their food.

The other is in the process of figuring out how to pay for a course to study youth justice and in a few years be studying some type of criminal law. (I imagine it's more specific, but I got distracted.)

So yes, we'd love education if we could get it. But, between the flawed school system that sticks 30 individuals all developing their personalities into a room and says ""Memorize these facts, also play nice with others or we'll punish you."" and the crushing weight of money being required to simply survive, it's not really an option.

The friend I mentioned who works at maccas, she works 38 hours a week, moves into management in 3 weeks, and ears $450 a week. That's $150 more per week than I earn from having a body that doesn't want to work right, and it consumes the vast majority of her time. And if she wasn't living with/supporting her dad and sister, she'd just barely be able to live in a 1 bed 1 bathroom place on her own.

And as a completely personal opinion on the religious fervor, we as a culture are more skeptical and don't give a fuck about a lot of things. We know our politicians are out to get us and there's nothing we can do about it. So whatever, we'll complain about it, but in the same way we complain about it being too hot/too cold. Yet, if a politician gets caught breaking the law, we'll jump down their throats as quick as we can, they fucked up, we caught them, we can do something now!

So, when people come along saying ""Here's this book, it says some dude made everything, he can fix everything, listen to us, do what we say and your life will be sorted out, just not in any tangible, physical or immediate way."" we, as a society just sort of ignored it.

"My problem with western feminism is this; it seems to have reached the stage now of fighting trivial things (depictions of females in video games) or things that are just ineradicable parts of human life (biology, human conflict, offensive language). 

I think there will probably always be partner conflict, people fighting, violence, rape and people being mean to each other on the internet. It's possible to minimise these bad things, but probably not to eradicate them altogether. 

It's also probably not possible to eradicate biological imperatives altogether, as some of the more radical feminists want to do. It all hinges on where you stand on the nature/nurture debate. In my opinion, culture and conditioning does have a huge role to play in human behaviour, but so does biology. I think it's about 60/40, or even 80/20, in favour of biology.

So, yes, men are on average stronger and more aggressive, so are probably more suited to physical work. The fact that women have wombs and glands that produce milk to feed children does more naturally suit them to child-rearing. This doesn't mean that they *have* to do these things, but I think it's crazy to ignore these biological facts. 

Equality can be assumed as a starting point, but there will never be perfect parity, nor should there be, because men and women are different functionally, and have obvious complementary roles. This probably dates from the enormous amount of time our species spent as hunter-gatherers, when there was probably a sex-based division of labour, with men hunting and women gathering and rearing children. Those ingrained behaviours are reflected in modern human behaviour in several obvious ways. 

As for the pay gap, it's actually illegal, in North America and in Europe, to pay women less for the same work than men. The difference you're seeing in pay is due to the fact that capitalism is a competitive hierarchical system which is not supposed to offer parity of wages, but where remuneration is based on all sorts of other factors, none of them fair. Capitalism has unfair remuneration of work and an unequal distribution of property built into it, so Equal Pay and anti-sexist legislation having been enacted (as it was in the UK and US 40 years ago), there's no reason to expect equality of pay beyond that on the arbitrary basis of gender, especially with men and women making such different decisions about education and work. 

I do think feminism is desperately needed in the Muslim world, in India, and in other traditionally patriarchal places. But ironically, any attempt to critique the cultural practices of these places is usually decried by feminists as orientalism and racialism. ",2

My dad confronted her in the restaurant, told her and the guy to pick up her stuff tomorrow morning. The guy said no, the girlfriend was acting indifferent and so my dad said he would ask her mother to help. My dad then sent an email to her entire family and copied her on it with proof including times, pictures of them in the restaurant, etc. Her mother came the next day and in front of her crying daughter told me, ""I don't know if she's just mentally ill, or if god just made her rotten, I know I'm not proud of this child"" 

Fucking 35 years old that woman was. Definitely my favorite of my dads girlfriends growing up. It's a shame",35

"Yeah I have a friend that lives in a frat house and they don't let passing out drunk people crash there because they're paranoid about scandals. 

I guess there were a few instances where girls got stupid dancing on tables naked drunk and thought they'd been taken advantage of when they woke up half naked on the couch of a frat house. They have cameras in the communal areas now too. 

Granted it is a pretty prestigious university where people tend to fall into the work hard/play hard mentality. ",287

"wow, I think you misread my post. My dad obviously didn't scream and yell at the employee, he just went back and asked for a refund whereas for example my mother would have just purchased a new one. lol my dad is cheap but hes definitely not the kind of guy to yell at a service worker, especially considering his social justice background as a young adult (long story not for reddit)",1

"People also ask advice to see if others will give them the advice they want to hear, to kind of get confirmation they're making the right decision.

If the advice is different from what they want to hear, they'll find a reason it's flawed and disregard it.

edit: Along the same lines of ""Take it with a grain of salt"" with regards to being offered advice, I'd say follow the same rules when giving others advice... don't think it's going to influence them.",1
Tongue.  Tongue is one of the most succulent and delicious pieces of meat you can get your hands on but so many people just think it's the nastiest thing ever.   The funniest to me was my buddy who was on a paleo kick who refused to eat it.  Because you know cave men only ate flank steak.,1
