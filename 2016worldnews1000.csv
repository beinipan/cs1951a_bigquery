"I'm from Belgium. I am a white person living 15kms (10 miles) from Molenbeek and I go there very often. Mainly because most of my friends are from this neighborhood. This neighborhood has become infamous for housing most of the terrorists now active in Western Europe.


What I can say is that everything is quiet except for the occasional search warrants carried out. 


A lot of the commotion here is mainly dreamt up by biased media. A good example is an article back when threat level was raised to 4 (very high) after the Paris bombing. 


The 'empty streets' were shot with lenses that add the optical illusioning of widening view. This means you only shoot one half of the street (the calmest half) and it will seem like 80% of the street is in view. 


Another good example is the article written at around the same time which interviewing some famous TV star at place Bourse in the center of Brussels. She literally said ""its 5 PM. The streets should be cramped with traffic right now but as you can see the streets are so empty that even pedestrians and bikes are using them"". 


Uhm yeah, no... The center of town including place Bourse was declared car free as a pilot project to improve air quality in Brussels. That was over a year ago. It had nothing to do with people being afraid to take their cars.


But then it all begins. People organizing events read this. They falsely think that any event with over 20 people is a target. Seriously, you think terrorists are going to shoot up your shitty electro dance event because there are some people together? Apparently they do. So events get cancelled. This creates an even bigger feeling of fear. I think it's a vicious cycle.

As for Germany, I don't know. Never been there so it's not up to me to make judgement. For Belgium I'd say tension is raised but we have yet to see craziness. 


There is up to now one reported case of groping by a group of 3 to 4 12-13 year old refugees. This needs to be taken seriously. But we have to be realistic as well. On a population of 20000 people who are refugees we're always going to have the devil's spawn among them in small numbers. This has not much to do with upbringing rather than self restraint. This is something that you'll also find among Westerners in small numbers.

That makes it sound like a neighbourhood watch style organisation, which wouldn't necessarily be bad at all. But the fact that it is anti-
migrant and nationalist makes it likely to attract racists and/or those with exremist views. And considering recent events, those people (and others who are angry at lack of reprisal) could easily be out for blood, despite the best intentions of other members of the group.

These revenge attacks typically lead to innocent people with no link to the rapists (even integrated migrants of long-term residency and women) being targeted, and previously assimilated minorities being alienated.

"When the question of how Europe will deal with the refugee influx or its growing Islamic minority is discussed, the more sanguine often mock those who raise concerns by stating that no, France or Germany isn't going to raise the crescent flag over the Elysee Palace or the Bundestag, because Muslims aren't going to become the majority anytime soon. Both sides invoke terms like ""Swedenistan"" or ""the French caliph"", whether as exaggerations to make a point or to mock those who do.

A minority does not have to become the majority, however, to greatly affect the overall society. /r/worldnews, a quick pop quiz: What percentage of Americans is black? What would you guess based on American news and pop culture? Go ahead, guess; I'll wait.

[...]

You probably guessed a figure [between 25 and 40%](https://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/3ncaz8/til_that_americans_consistently_overestimate/). The answer is [12-13%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity). Yes, a group less than 13% of the population continues to pose many dilemmas for a nation of 320 million, 150 years after the end of slavery and 50 years after the end of legal oppression.

*The* great social question in the US for the past two centuries has been—as the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal wrote in his 1944 book *[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Dilemma)*—how to to treat its black residents: First whether to free them from slavery, then whether to fight a war to end slavery, then whether to mandate equal rights for them, then how to deal with the group's persistent social dysfunctions (massively higher per-capita crime and poverty rates, massively lower educational and professional attainments). **Every other** ethnic group has integrated more successfully than black Americans. In almost every area of American society, it is not ""black versus white"", but ""blacks versus everyone else"".

And remember, black Americans—unlike most of today's European refugees, or the Islamic residents of Tower Hamlet or Luton or Malmo or French *banlieus*—share the same language, religion, and most aspects of culture with their countrymen. Germany does not have to have a majority vote to change its name to the Islamic Republic of Deutschland for the country to be very different from today, perhaps unrecognizably so.

----

Assimilation *can* suceed, in manageable numbers and between similar cultures. As an American I want my government to do a much better job of combating illegal immigration, but that's mostly out of concern over the risk to civic society from systematic flouting of laws and borders, and of taking too many people too fast without controls, not because I think that Hispanics or other people are inherently incapable of assimilation. Hispanic immigrants' cultures are similar to that of Americans: Christians that have a reputation of working hard, making good food, and producing fully American children and grandchildren that speak English, serve in the armed forces, and build small businesses.

There is a well-known phenomenon in many American cities of groups of men, usually of Latin American background, gathering on certain street corners and the parking lots of home-improvement stores. People who, say, need a handyman to do some repair work around the home drive up, hire one, and leave, as if buying a takeout dinner.

They are usually paid in cash and it is assumed that the Latins are usually illegal immigrants, as if they were here legally they would probably be on a construction site making more money. Nonetheless, there is always demand for their services as they have a reputation for hard work; for Europeans, think of the way the ""Polish plumber"" is seen in your country.

The usual career track of a young male Mexican illegal immigrant goes something like this:

* Arrives in the US.
* Travels to a big city.
* Waits at an aforementioned street corner for work, or works in construction/plumbing for an employer that does not strictly enforce employment restrictions.
* Gets his own set of tools.
* Gets his own pickup truck.
* Meets a nice girl.
* Obtains legal working papers.
* Goes into business for himself.
* Moves to the suburbs with the wife and (fluent in English, not so fluent with Spanish) children.

Europeans, does anything like that happen in your country? Have *any* of the African/Middle Eastern illegal immigrants/refugees gained a similar reputation for hard work? Except for the Turks in Germany (they came legally, of course, and I have heard mixed things about their cultural integration), I have yet to see any evidence of this.",130

You don't have to integrate if you just stay in your small community. The men go to work. The children go to migrant/Muslim scools. The women stay home. When the children get old enough, the boys go to the next level of education, the girls stay home. I taught English at a college for a bit and only one of my students was Muslim and could speak Dutch/English.

• Ranking sentences by importance using the core algorithm.
• Reorganizing the summary to focus on a topic; by selection of a keyword.
• Removing transition phrases.
• Removing unnecessary clauses.
• Removing excessive examples.

The core algorithm works by these simplified steps:

1) Associate words with their grammatical counterparts. (e.g. ""city"" and ""cities"")
2) Calculate the occurrence of each word in the text.
3) Assign each word with points depending on their popularity.
4) Detect which periods represent the end of a sentence. (e.g ""Mr."" does not).
5) Split up the text into individual sentences.
6) Rank sentences by the sum of their words' points.
7) Return X of the most highly ranked sentences in chronological order.",216

India still has an extremely hierarchical society and it's not hard to figure out why. Casteism translates quite well into classism, and seeing people from other social strata as subhuman becomes a cultural problem. It can be argued that along with the sanitation problems, littering too is something that is a result of the ""lower caste servants and sweepers will clean up after me, not my job, don't care"". I'd argue that the massive social inequality in India where the poorest of the poor live like rats is given a pass for many reasons - but the inherent hierarchy in society stemming from caste is at least partially responsible.

I completely agree that it is not right. Today, from our cultural viewpoint, it is horrific.

However, you cannot deny the fact that lots of acts that are considered awful today used to be perfectly acceptable, including things like owning slaves, stoning gays and adulterers, or marrying children. 

Therefore, it is obvious that moral guidelines do change dramatically over time. And they don't always change in the same direction either. Bisexuality was commonly accepted in ancient Greece and became taboo over time until today where it is still not accepted by older generations.

I'm not defending child marriage, I'm pointing out that morality *is* dynamic. We *will* be judged by future generations for acting in ways that we consider perfectly acceptable today.

"&gt; Where I sailed last in the BVI, we had a briefing telling us good anchor spots and were given a map.

You were given a chart, not a map.

&gt; Additionally, depending on how you anchor, the current and tide can pull your ship in a full 360 circle around your anchor point.

A good captain is well aware of that and will always take it into account- not the least because it may trip the anchor and allow the vessel to drift away.

Also- tides rise and fall. Currents ebb and flow. A tide cannot ""pull your ship in a full 360 circle"".

&gt; A 30 foot boat should lay out around 50 feet of anchor line (most of which sits on the bottom).

So if you're anchoring in 40 feet of water you only need 50 feet of rode?

Also- most of it should not be sitting on the bottom. The only way that would happen is if there was no wind or current, you were using a chain rode, and you had a ton of scope. Heck [even the picture you linked to](http://ephemerisle.org/index.php/Anchoring) doesn't show the rode sitting on the bottom.

&gt; At 330 feet, we're talking about a 1000 feet of heavy chain to keep that ship in place.

I'm sorry but where are you coming up with these numbers?

I've sailed my entire life and I've never once heard anything like this. The amount of rode you pay out is dependent on depth and desired scope. Scope is determined primarily by weather conditions and bottom composition (though duration of stay and whether or not you will be aboard are also factors). The only time the size of the vessel is taken into account is if it has a lot of windage- e.g. a tall cruise ship versus a low slung tanker and that's still largely a weather concern- not really a ship size concern.

A heavy chain rode needs less scope than a nylon rode or a combination rode- but it still doesn't have anything to do with the vessel's length. Chain is used because it artificially increases the scope of the rode near the anchor and helps keep it set.

Here is West Marine's page on selecting an anchor rode:

http://www.westmarine.com/WestAdvisor/Selecting-An-Anchor-Rode

Scroll to the bottom. They mention the thickness/strength of the rode as a function of the size of the vessel- but not the length of the rode. Specifically:

""In general the load on an anchor line varies with the square of the LOA of the boat. A high windage, heavy displacement boat such as a trawler or fishing boat will require heavier anchor rode than an ultra-light racing sailboat of the same LOA.""

- Yes, Brazil is definitely more violent than most 1st world countries, but in 34 years living there, middle class me was never robbed and I never suffered any type of violence. I'm not saying that my home country is not violent, it definitely has a lot of problems in this area, but as long as you don't go out alone during the night and stick to the populated areas you should be fine.

- Every time there's a big event in Brazil and the whole world have their eyes on the country (like the World Cup or the Olympics) then the army go the streets and occupy every corner of the cities. The police also invade the most dangerous area and make sure to drive off (or sometimes, kill) all criminals there - it's what we call ""to pacify the area"".

But let's be real for a moment. Those arguments saying: ""They deserve it, they are lazy-ass monkeys"" and etc, often coming from Brazilians themselves, are pretty fucking stupid, and frankly borderline racist. 


It's not untrue. Brazilians are often corrupt. But what, do you think they are genetically predisposed for that? Do you think it's because of the *picanha* or the *show de bola*? Is there maybe something in the water? Are the *BOPE* spraying mind-altering chemicals every time they raid a favela? 


It's simply a question of education. And lo and behold, Brazilians are poor and poor people have less access to education. I hate the notion of privilege and its misuse, but in this case I feel confident when I say that some of you come from privileged countries and don't even realise what an advantage it is to afford a good education. 


Of course Norwegians and Finnish and even Americans are less corrupt. Ironically, you need money in order to not be corrupt. Get off your gold plated high horses and realise that no, those people don't *deserve* what they're going through just because they're corrupt. Yes, them being corrupt only makes it worse.

""In Sweden there has been this ambition explicitly to record every case of sexual violence separately, to make it visible in the statistics,"" she says.
""So, for instance, when a woman comes to the police and she says my husband or my fiance raped me almost every day during the last year, the police have to record each of these events, which might be more than 300 events. In many other countries it would just be one record - one victim, one type of crime, one record.""

""Unlike the majority of countries in Europe, crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported, at which point the classification may be unclear. In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape, it retains this classification in the published crime statistics, even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification "" ",251

"Make no mistake about it. This is a failure in the Canadian justice system and police force. That allegations without any evidence are taken seriously enough to get to a courtroom. It's an insult by the Canadian system to the principle of free speech. Literally a **twitter argument leads to the courtroom because the colluding, lying  conspirators (the ~~two~~ three ladies) falsely accuse the man of harassment.** Incredible.

Just the mere accusation and a few tears is enough to ruin a man's life. Gender fairness? Would this happen if a guy accused a woman of pedophilia or stalking? Would that woman be trying to defend herself and incurring lawyer fees for ~~TWO~~ FOUR YEARS? Lose his job? Banned from using computers for 3 years??

This is what happens when you keep perpetuating a myth of victimhood, entertain the nonsense of ""safezones"", forget to teach kids about free speech in school, and you perpetuate the myth of helpless women being damsels in distress who need to be coddled and take no responsibility for their own actions. Or when you repeatedly parrot ""stop blaming the victim"" when you **don't yet know** who the real victim is and who the real perpetrator is. 

There's even some laws in some places in the Western world, where you can't even bring up the documented history of a witness or accuser, when it goes to the credibility of the witness or accuser. **Liars are being coddled.** 

That's insane. I've seen a number of cases where sisters or a group of girls pressure each other to lie in a court room about someone else in order to beef up original lies by one accuser. In this Canadian case, **a group of 3 SJW women conspire and lie about a man harassing/stalking them on twitter because he argued against their ~~political views~~ feminist discussion about doxxing a man and sending harassing letters to his employer and even accused Gregory Elliott of pedophelia!**

**Edit:** Everyone should contact their legislature and make sure that there are laws with prison sentences to prosecute false accusers that dishonor real victims.

"Communist Albania also was a dictatorial and politically isolated hellhole not unlike North Korea. Hoxha and Shehu broke with the Soviet Union because Khrushchev was not Stalinist enough for them and they broke with China because they considered Mao an ally of American imperialism. 

People were arbitrarily arrested and disappeared in the country's gulags or executed right away for criticism.

&gt; The 40-year period of Hoxha's rule was characterized by the elimination of the opposition, prolific use of the death penalty or long prison terms for his political opponents and evictions of their families from their homes to remote villages that were strictly controlled by police and the secret police (Sigurimi). His rule was also characterized by Stalinist methods to destroy his associates who threatened his own power.

I'm not sure you can do what Communist Albania did without slaughtering everyone who disagrees.

EDIT: Found some more about how they treated the religious:

&gt;  All religious practices were officially banned. All churches, mosques, tekkes, monasteries, and other religious institutions were either closed down or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, or workshops.

&gt; The clergy were publicly vilified and humiliated, their vestments taken and desecrated.

"These feminist women have an easier time complaining against ""civilized softies"" than hardcore muslim abusers. 

This is repeated ad nauseam I know, but seriously.. if I was a bigtime feminist I would be very openly against an Islamic invasion knowing how their women are treated. 

What is their fucking deal? Men are physically stronger and more capable of protection. So what if they say they want to protect their woman? They only hone in on ""their"" and get all prickly and offended. Men want to protect their country too. Is it offensive to say ""their"" in that case as well? Is it offensive for women to say ""we love our German men"" and etc.? And since when is ""being offensive"" the gravest offense? This is getting so absurd. Men just want to serve their biological role as brute defender. But a big portion of our society is telling us that is a no-no and it hurts the feelings of the free feminist woman. Our world is going batshit insane with all the entitlement civilized life has fed us. 

Meanwhile muslim migrant men here *literally* view women as lesser beings and property to be had. Asses to smack. Holes to finger whether they like it or not. Things to have sex with (rape) whether they want it or not. Who is the bigger enemy to feminism here?

That is not how philosophy or political theory should be done.

I don't consider the text itself dangerous in any way. It is not very persuasive and generally presents a poor case.

Japan, once you get over the doe-eyed honeymoon view of Japan that a lot of tourists and foreigners have, is a very normal and flawed country. People still barge, ignore queues, are rude and loud. Despite the cultural obligation that leads to some very good service, you can hear the lack of enthusiasm the moment you enter a store and hear a half-baked 'irrashaimase'. With some of the more menial jobs, like standing with a sign, or cleaning escalator handles, you can see an empty husk that used to be a person.

[Discrimination against Italian immigrants](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian8.html)

&gt; As immigration from Europe and Asia neared its crest in the late 19th century, anti-immigrant sentiment soared along with it. The U.S. was in the grips of an economic depression, and immigrants were blamed for taking American jobs. At the same time, racialist theories circulated in the press, advancing pseudo scientific theories that alleged that “Mediterranean” types were inherently inferior to people of northern European heritage. Drawings and songs caricaturing the new immigrants as childlike, criminal, or subhuman became sadly commonplace. One 1891 cartoon claimed that “If immigration was properly restricted, you would never be troubled with anarchism, socialism, the Mafia and such kindred evils!”

&gt;Attacks on Italians were not limited to the printed page, however. From the late 1880s, anti-immigrant societies sprang up around the country, and the Ku Klux Klan saw a spike in membership. Catholic churches and charities were vandalized and burned, and Italians attacked by mobs. In the 1890s alone, more than 20 Italians were lynched.

"&gt; The fact that they now have the capability of producing hydrogen weapons (provided they actually built this device themselves) gives them a much larger bargaining chip by the looks of things. The difference between atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons is that atomic devices only use fission whilst hydrogen use both fission and fusion and effectively create a larger explosion and have theoretically have no upper limit. 

I would just say — there are a lot of definitions of ""hydrogen bomb"" that have been used over the years. Could be a boosted bomb (fusion improved fission weapon), could be a layer cake bomb (similar to boosted but a little more fission), could be an experiment in thermonuclear reactions (like the US test ""Greenhouse George""), could be a ""real"" hydrogen bomb (staged radiation implosion), could be ... whatever they want to call it. Under all that rock it seems like it will be hard to outsiders externally confirm whether there were any real fusion reactions or not. (If it were atmospheric, the fallout would be pretty straightforward to analyze.) The yield doesn't seem bigger than their previous tests, so I'm leaning towards ""boosting,"" ""experiment,"" with a possibility of ""bullcrap."" (Though there is no inherent reason to doubt their ability to do such a thing — it is 50-year-old technology.)

Yes, you can theoretically build a hydrogen bomb up to any size. _But_ you won't fit a monster bomb onto a missile.

&gt; These cases spring from the FBI takeover of Playpen in February 2015, which US court documents described as &amp;quot;The largest remaining known child pornography hidden service in the world.&amp;quot; After seizing the site, the FBI used a network investigative technique-the agency&amp;#039;s term for a hacking tool-in an attempt to identify users of the site.

Several gunfights. No indication of Isis involvement - intelligence chief.** Actually it has been linked to ISIS.

**Yet another explosion near bomb site** (12:39 EST); At 1AM EST, **explosion at Starbucks**, **after** 25 officers stormed it. Not clear if the same as what was reported at 12:39.

""Indonesia's national police spokesman says explosions suspected to have been carried out by suicide bomber""

&gt;Police were not immediately available for comment, but according to the an official Jakarta police Twitter account one explosion went off in front of a shopping centre called the Sarinah mall.

From [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-blast-idUSKCN0US0BW20160114)

Edit 1: Media said six bombs went of and a Reuters witness saw three dead people and a gunfight going on.

&gt; There has been a lull in the shooting but someone is on the roof of the building and police are aiming their guns at him,"" said a Reuters photographer. 

Edit 2:  ~~Separate explosion heard in west Jakarta suburb of Palmerah: domestic media~~ (confirmed false)

Edit 3: At 11:40 EST, Shootouts are still being reported in Jakarta, including at one of the blast sites below.

Edit 4: **[Video of an explosion](https://twitter.com/robetbet/status/687493691594809344)**;  Here is a [picture](https://twitter.com/fauzbert/status/687489770054799360): 

Edit  5: Indonesia police say around **10-14 gunmen** involved in central Jakarta attack 

Edit 6: 4 dead according to Guardian (one police officer and 3 ~~civilians~~ (apparently not))

Edit 7: Attackers equipped with grenades too. Explosions apparently from grenades, not bombs. Two people have also been injured. UN not affected.

Edit 8: Fairfax Media’s Indonesia correspondent, Jewel Topsfield, is reporting seven explosions, including two suicide bombers. She adds that three suspected perpetrators are among the four dead. We’ve previously heard that at least one police officer may have been killed. 

Edit 9: [Map](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41070c539b5f8a729c523d363ee5d3fae5dde3d2/0_0_620_500/master/620.jpg?w=620&amp;q=85&amp;auto=format&amp;sharp=10&amp;s=d73758d6487ab630a91e903def38e3fd)

Edit 10: 3 police dead, 3 civilians dead, according to police, but apparently civilians are the perpetrators?

Edit 11: At least **three more explosions have taken place in Jakarta**, in addition to the six, possibly seven reported earlier. This is in Cikni, Silpi and Kuningan neighborhoods, near the Turkish and Pakistani embassies.

Edit 12: Jakarta police say ISIS related 

Edit 13: Scene still active, shots being fired (5 min ago from this edit)

Edit 14: One of the explosions was a bomb, the others were grenades apparently.

Edit 15: UN staff member injured. Internal note in UN staff in Jakarta: Dear colleagues, more explosions and shootings in the area. Apparently they are using rifles and hand grenades. We are in a perimeter in our UN building covered by armed personnel. We may have a UN staff injured during the initial bombing.

Edit 16: Three suicide bombers involved in attack on Starbucks cafe. Apparently 5 of them went to the Starbucks. 3 blew themselves up, the other two went running, police in pursuit. (observations from security guard). Central bank and many embassies are nearby all this.

Edit 17: Up to six of the alleged attackers are still believed to be hiding in the Skyline building, at the site of the Starbucks cafe reportedly hit by three suicide bombers. No hostages at this point.

Edit 18: Police say gunfire has stopped. No arrests (but I don't know what that means; dead or not?)

Edit 19: ""Two suspected perpetrators fled in direction of West Jakarta."" From my understanding, 3 died at Starbucks, 2 others fled the scene. 6 are holed up in Skyline or some building. (So I believe the 2 that fled were with the 5 who went to Starbucks). There may be 2-3 others.

Edit 20: Further explosion heard near site of Jakarta attacks

Edit 21: Police are still looking for gunmen who are believed to be holed up in the Cakrawala building on Jalan Thamrin street, also the site of the Starbucks cafe and UN headquarters. The Jakarta Post reports that police were also seen entering the McDonald’s restaurant at the Sarinah building at around 12.15 pm, with gun shots still ringing out in the area.

Edit 22 (12:59AM EST): Indonesian President condemns attacks. Also the US embassy in Jakarta has released this message urging its citizens to avoid specific areas in the centre of the Indonesian capital: “This emergency message is being issued to advise all U.S. citizens to avoid the area around Sari Pan Pacific Hotel and Sarinah Plaza on Jalan Sudirman Thamrin, in downtown Jakarta. Preliminary reports indicate an explosion and gunfire has occurred in the general vicinity and situation continues to unfold.”

Edit 23: (1:03 AM EST) **Explosion reported near Starbucks cafe** An Associated Press reporter has heard an explosion from a cafe near the Starbucks that was attacked earlier. The explosion occurred **after** about 25 anti-terror squad police stormed the cafe. Tanks are being brought too.

Edit 24: One of the bodies outside the Sarinah Mall has been removed, and police are continuing to examine others at the scene, Beh Lih Yi reports.

Edit 25: (1:12 AM) Intelligence chief says not ISIS 

Edit 26: Indonesian President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has just been on national TV saying the situation is under control, and is calling on people to remain calm.

Edit 27: 1:25 AM EST: No indication of Isis involvement - intelligence chief. It looks like civilians are out of harms way for the most part by this point.

Edit 27 (7:24 AM): Palmerah, Slipi, Kuningan bombing are false reports. Thanks /u/IndoPr0. (Sorry for the delay in edits, had to sleep). A foreigner among dead. 4 attackers arrested.

Edit 28: chief security minister says 5 enemies dead in total (so 2 police, not 3 as initially reported). Not clear who the foreigner is.

Edit 29: Since ISIS media 'claims' responsibility, but intelligence thinks that it was a local group who sympathizes with ISIS. (Based in Solo Indonesia) and sorry, 20 injured (not 2), forgot to update

Edit 30: they're calling it ISIS",1248

"&gt;The only way to stop the whole thing is to give people jobs, communities and safety, such that they only have time to fight holy wars in YouTube comments and not in real life.

Sorry, I find this unconvincing. There are far poorer places on Earth than Syria and Iraq. Lots of countries in Africa and Asia are much worse off, but they don’t have morality police going around enforcing burkas, burning down girls’ schools, beheading dozens in mass public orgies of violence. Conversely, there are plenty of educated and well off people from Europe rushing off to join ISIS. They were not starving, they were not illiterate, they had far better prospects than the average Syrian. But they throw it all away to join the jihad in Syria.

Blaming everything on lack of jobs or poverty is silly. These things don’t cause terrorism, otherwise the world would be awash in African and Asian terrorism. It’s ideology that causes terrorism, and that ideology often comes from the rich and privileged, not from the poor and desperate. It comes from billionaire oil sheiks funding it in the Gulf, it’s transmitted by educated middle class people who become the recruiters. The poor are only peripherally involved.

Second, it’s a mistake to compare ISIS to Al Qaeda or half a dozen other such terrorist organizations before. Again, this is about ideology, and what ISIS has going for it is the hugely powerful concept of the Caliphate in Islam. Of course, not every Muslim buys into it, but for those who do, this gives ISIS legitimacy that Al Qaeda never had. If a legitimate Caliphate exists anywhere in the world, then it is the duty of every Muslim to live in that Caliphate, or to extend it to their own lands so they come under its rule. This is a powerful influence on those who acknowledge ISIS as legitimate, and this is a growing number of people even in western countries.

This is why we should stop pussy-footing around and remove ISIS as quickly as possible. Yes, that doesn’t guarantee that some other fundie group won’t take over, but we can try to oppose that and to minimize its impact. And so long as it’s not calling itself the Caliphate, that will still be a win.",384

"&gt; P.S. I needed to add that Jewish Americans should take note of European affairs. Jewish Americans are often VERY liberal and socialistic, and think that the State will make a paradise. Why so many think that way is a mystery to me, as the State now is betraying French Jews, and in the 20th Century in the USSR &amp; Germany the State betrayed them too. The State is a fickle thing that can change its mind about you.

European Jews aren't leftists because they want an all-powerful state.  The history of Jewish liberalism is tied to the liberal defense of minority rights.  Jews founded the biggest human rights organizations in the world (Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First).  A Jewish French diplomat named Rene Cassin had to flee the Nazis during WWII.  When he returned, he authored the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  Cassin said ""Jews will only be equal when everyone is.""  That's why Jews are historically left-wing voters -- because of the left's historical protection of the rights and freedoms of minorities.

The early appeal of communism to Russian Jews was the same idea.  Communism was meant to guarantee the equality of all.  That's why Jews liked it.  They thought they would finally be treated equally.  Didn't work out that way though.

The goal of Zionism too was always that the Jews be treated fairly like any other nation and have the rights of other nations (like self-determination).",139

It takes a complete lack of empathy on the attacker's part to do these things. A woman is a lot physically closer to a man than a dog, all the body language and signs of ""you're hurting me"" will be instantly recognizable yet they persist. Empathy has been bred out of their culture which is terrifying because I want to believe empathy is a universal human trait. However, when you take a look at children who were abused and neglected from a very early age, many of them don't properly develop empathy and live difficult lives. It seems like large portions of the Muslim world are like this. Just mentally fucking broken.

In the western world if you beat your dog it's taken away and you get charged with a crime. You may never be able to own animals again. I can't feel the dog analogy is accurate given dogs really do have more rights and are treated better than women in many parts of the ME.

""Neo-Nazi attacks on German Jews far outnumber those by Islamists According to figures presented last week  to the German parliament, out of 1,275 incidents which occurred in 2013, neo-Nazis were considered responsible for 1,218 of them. The data also revealed a slight decrease in the number of attacks compared to 2012, yet no one is yet ready to declare this as a positive trend. According to official records, only 31 attacks in 2013 were committed by people of a foreign background and the rest (26) were attributed to other offenders. This was the first year in over a decade in which no antisemitic attack was ascribed to left-wing radicals. Also in 2012, during which 1,374 attacks were committed, right-wing extremists were blamed for nearly all incidents, with only 38 cases traced back to foreigners, three to left-wing activists and 19 to other attackers. A similar distribution was found also in the years 2001-2011.""

Edit: 
Ps: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_and_the_New_Testament

""According to the new study (2014) 18% of Germans think that Jews are responsible for their persecution because of their behavior. The survey was published on Tuesday in Bielefeld, by the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence (ICG) at the University of Bielefeld. 15% of respondents believe that Jews have too much influence in Germany. Among respondents over the age of 60, this figure was 23%. ""

In Hungary  48% of the jews are thinking about leaving the country.

Edit 3: Because I unintentionally replied to the wrong person.

""Suppressing free speech on social networks and of anti-migrant protests"" 
I know this argument is absurd but lets look at the numbers : http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2016-01/rechte-gewalt-fluechtlinge-buergerwehren-bka-chef
Every newspaper is full of stories about refugees commiting crimes every single day, since months. The social networks are rioting since months over the refugee crisis. 
The numbers of violent right winged protestors getting prosecuted is laughable, google the incidents of Heidenau.

Google translate:

""The number of right-wing attacks in 2015 had risen considerably. In a report by the Federal Government on request of the Left Party 11,312 offenses are recorded in the period from January to the end of October. 2014 the number stood at 10.541 legal acts of radicals. The number of acts of violence amounted to 2015 759 offenses. In total, 582 people were injured. The report shows mainly an increase of attacks against migrants and refugees, 3,155 deeds, the police recorded nationwide.

Of the !5,970! suspects !151! alleged perpetrators have been arrested. The crimes against refugees and refugee shelters, particularly arson, shows a bad clearance rate. A search of THE TIME time- and Online Revealed that in 222 cases investigated the attacks against refugee shelters, a sentence has been passed only in four cases. In eight other cases, charges were brought against the perpetrators. In all cases that have been investigated in the research, were people hurt or could be hurt.""

Long story short, you can commit arson and physical attacks on refugees or police forces without actually having to fear to be prosecuted. -Much oppression-

http://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-aims-to-provoke-backlash-against-muslims-in-west-1449743581

One of their strategies that they state clearly, and your can read in their monthly glossy news magazine, is to draw the west into ostracizing Muslims, making them unwanted, feared, and hated, so they are more receptive to their own message, and they are the only place to turn. It's a powerful strategy and we are helping them succeed. 

The concern isn't ""he called me a terrorist, I'm going to become a terrorist"" like you said. A mosque in my town in California had a Molotov cocktail thrown at it recently. Thankfully it looks like it was poorly out together and it didn't end up doing much damage, but if that happened to your church would you feel angry? Victimization is the most powerful propaganda tool. The feelings of anger and insecurity that we felt after 9/11 lead us to do drastic things, remember that we don't have a monopoly on those feelings.  Undisciplined islamophobic dog whistling doesn't help anything. Bush at least gave a speech stating this is not a war against Islam, it seems like over the last decade of war we've drifted past even that lip service. And seriously this is not ""PC"" and I'm not being an SJW, this is simply common sense. I'm not worried at all about hurting people's feelings, I'm concerned about terrorism becoming a worse problem in the future, and us maintaining perpetual war.

https://youtu.be/0S2NKlMW0vc?t=545

The white government of Ian Smith accepted to hold elections, and a black president was elected, along with a black-majority parliment. This was still not satisfactory for Mugabe who at the time was a rebel-leader and refused to lay down arms. You can read more about this here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesian_Bush_War#Resolution

&gt; Also how come the natives didn't just take over the whites farms and continue to produce food and aquire wealth?

Because the land wasn't given to ""the people"", it was redistributed to Mugabe loyalists who had no intention of toiling in the fields or paying anyone to do so.

There's also the knowledge loss to consider: imagine someone gives you a plot of land, a bag of seeds and says ""alright, you're now a farmer, get to work!"". What's the best time to plant crops? How and how often are they to be irrigated? How do you deal with pests and crop loss? How are you going to collect and sell the crops?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight#Zimbabwe_.28Rhodesia.29

From the article:

&gt; From a strictly economic point of view, the departure figures were not as significant as the loss of the skills of those leaving.[41] A disproportionate number of white Zimbabwean emigrants were well educated and highly skilled. Among those living in the United States, for example, 53.7% had a bachelor's degree, while only 2% had not completed secondary school.[45] Most (52.4%) had occupied technical or supervisory positions of critical importance to the modern sector of the economy.[45] Inasmuch as black workers did not begin making large inroads into apprenticeships and other training programs until the 1970s, few were in a position to replace their white colleagues in the 1980s.[41]

Mugabe treated the country as his own little fiefdom, shared no power and he and his cronies grossly mismanaged every sector of government and the economy.

He could as well said that he won't allow immigrants from nazi moon base. There's no intention behind his words other than scare people to elect him again.

As we increase the amount of protons, the neutrons don't increase at the same rate, they always increase more. As elements become heavier, then to do elements become less stable. The new element 117 most stable isotopes only last for milliseconds. The reason for this is inside it's nucleus 117 protons and ~170 neutrons are trying to find a literal geometric configuration such that the forces they exert on each other will not cause particle loss from radiation. In the case of element 117 it will decay in a matter of seconds losing protons until it gets to a relatively stable point.

Some configurations of neutrons and protons are only stable for portions of a second at a time and other configurations have half-lifes that seem to be longer than the age of the universe.",266

&gt; More than 2,100 pregnant Colombians are infected with the mosquito-borne Zika virus, the country&amp;#039;s national health institute said on Saturday, as the disease continues its spread across the Americas.

&gt; There are 20,297 confirmed cases of the virus in Colombia, the national health institute said in a epidemiology bulletin, with 2,116 pregnant women among them.

&gt; The health ministry has said Zika infection falls within the health requirements women must meet to get abortions in the country, which restricts the procedure unless patients are victims of rape, have significant medical problems or the fetus is fatally deformed.

We're all terrified.
Hong Kong is supposed to be that one city in China that is safe for freedom of speech...where human rights are valued

Here's what we know so far...from a radio broadcast phone call with the victim's wife.

(i) Victim is actually the owner of the bookstore

(ii) He received a big order (about 14 books), so he went to the warehouse in the afternoon(about 30min train ride) alone to get the books ready for the transaction, which was supposed to be later the same day IN Hong Kong

(iiii) Later at 730pm, he did not arrive home, which is abnormal 

(iv) Victim's wife said that he never bring his Chinese passport card with him because he refuses to enter into mainland China 

(v) Around 1030pm, his wife received a phone from Shenzhen (mainland China), and whoever was on the other end of the phone told her that if the victim closes down the bookstore, matters would be handled lightly this time

Here is the tricky part:
--- Hong Kong immigration has NO record of the victim leaving Hong Kong

Again, I don't know if posting this will raise enough international attention to help with the victim's release/getting home to Hong Kong safely, but I really hope that any little bit help because I cannot even bear to imagine the fear and helplessness victim's family is feeling right now.",152

1. Better educated people better realize how much work it is to have children and don't rush into the choice unprepared.
2. Better educated people are more likely to use contraceptives to avoid unwanted pregnancy.
3. Perhaps there's a correlation between being better educated and being more likely to abort an unwanted pregnancy? Certainly this is something of note for comparing western countries to third world ones (where abortion is frequently illegal or at least less accessible).
4. Presumably being better educated correlates with being wealthy.
5. Wealthier people won't have kids simply for the hope that said kids might become rich and/or help care for their parents when they get old.
6. Perhaps less wealth causes you to look more to children for a source of happiness? After all, wealthier people tend to be able to afford numerous sources of happiness and are generally happier as a whole.
7. Having kids you can't afford shows poor money management skills. Naturally we could expect having many kids you can't afford to correlate with low wealth. ie, the rich can be rich simply because they don't have kids.",273

"&gt;Due to its immigration policy, Sweden now has the largest gender imbalance of any documented nation with an estimated 123 boys for every 100 girls 

&gt;According to the UNHCR, 58 per cent of the more than 1 million migrants and refugees who arrived in Europe last year were adult men, 17 per cent were women, and the remainder were children. Professor Valerie Hudson, a Texas A&amp;M University professor, said gender imbalances could cause serious problems in the community.

&gt;She said societies where men outnumbered women were more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women.

&gt;""I looked specifically at the figures that Sweden had provided on its migrants — 71 per cent of whom are male,"" she said. ""And then in the age group 16 to 17 years old, which is what I focused on, over 90 per cent are male.""

&gt;Professor Hudson said regardless of where the gender balance was the consequences were broadly the same. ""What we have found uniformly is a rise in crime, particularly violent crime, property crime, crime against women,"" she said. ""We also see much more ease of recruitment into criminal gangs, or quasi-rebel/social movement-type gangs. ""We also see across the board a more constrained lifestyle for women and there's also a significant rise in demand for trafficked women, either as 'brides' or prostitutes.""",688

&gt;“When we came out of the station, we were very surprised by the group that met us there”. She said the group was “exclusively young foreign men”. Keeping close to her friends, they pressed on:

&gt;“We then walked through this group of men. There was an alley through [the men] which we walked through. Suddenly I felt a hand on my buttocks, then on my breasts, in the end, I was groped everywhere. It was a nightmare. Although we shouted and beat them, the guys did not stop. I was desperate and think I was touched around 100 times in the 200 meters.

&gt;“Fortunately I wore a jacket and trousers. a skirt would probably have been torn away from me”.

The above is largely true for Islam! At this point they're a normal convert.

"For the skeptics out there, here are the parts of the article that have doubts about the planet.

&gt;Others, like planetary scientist Dave Jewitt, who discovered the Kuiper belt, are more cautious. The 0.007% chance that the clustering of the six objects is coincidental gives the planet claim a statistical significance of 3.8 sigma—beyond the 3-sigma threshold typically required to be taken seriously, but short of the 5 sigma that is sometimes used in fields like particle physics. That worries Jewitt, who has seen plenty of 3-sigma results disappear before. By reducing the dozen objects examined by Sheppard and Trujillo to six for their analysis, Batygin and Brown weakened their claim, he says. “I worry that the finding of a single new object that is not in the group would destroy the whole edifice,” says Jewitt, who is at UC Los Angeles. “It’s a game of sticks with only six sticks.”

.......
&gt;Even if Batygin and Brown can convince other astronomers that Planet X exists, they face another challenge: explaining how it ended up so far from the sun. At such distances, the protoplanetary disk of dust and gas was likely to have been too thin to fuel planet growth. And even if Planet X did get a foothold as a planetesimal, it would have moved too slowly in its vast, lazy orbit to hoover up enough material to become a giant.

........
&gt;Hal Levison, a planetary dynamicist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, agrees that something has to be creating the orbital alignment Batygin and Brown have detected. But he says the origin story they have developed for Planet X and their special pleading for a gas-slowed ejection add up to “a low-probability event.” Other researchers are more positive. The proposed scenario is plausible, Laughlin says. “Usually things like this are wrong, but I’m really excited about this one,” he says. “It’s better than a coin flip.”

.......
&gt;One telescope can help: Subaru, an 8-meter telescope in Hawaii that is owned by Japan. It has enough light-gathering area to detect such a faint object, coupled with a huge field of view—75 times larger than that of a Keck telescope. That allows astronomers to scan large swaths of the sky each night. Batygin and Brown are using Subaru to look for Planet X—and they are coordinating their efforts with their erstwhile competitors, Sheppard and Trujillo, who have also joined the hunt with Subaru. Brown says it will take about 5 years for the two teams to search most of the area where Planet X could be lurking.",912

"A price of a stock on the market can usually be split into two (logically, not actually). What the stock is actually backed by (e.g. all of the company's assets, their cash reserve etc.) and some kind of ""speculative price"".

The first part is self explanatory. The second is the additional money people are willing to pay, because of expectations of growth. E.g. A company has 10 shares and assets worth 10$ dollars. Each stock is backed by 1$ in company assets. But if people expect the company to bring in another 10$ in profit, they might want to buy/sell for 2$ a share so in total the shares are worth 20$, the amount people think the company will be worth next year. But if next year company's assets are worth only 15$ instead of expected 20$ it means that the growth is slower then predicted. This means that now people have 20$ in stock for a 15$ company. Let's say next year the company makes only 2$ in profit. Now the company is worth 17$ but the stock total price is still 20$. Some people may want to panic sell because the profits ale smaller each year and their stock may not ""truly"" be worth 2$ anytime soon. The company is still constantly profitable but the pattern of this profit is what shaped the price of stock initially and what shapes it now. This is an example where the profit is smaller each year. But for hyped up companies, even growing profit rates can cause loss of value, if the profit doesn't grow as fast as expected.

There were no Uncle Sam signs aimed at children. Pedophilia was not up there with baseball and apple pie. To suggest that maybe it wasn't okay to have sex with children, or that pedophilia was not an inherant American institution, didn't make you a heathen.

It is very fucked up that was the social and legal climate in 1700/1800s America. But what's fucked up **RIGHT NOW**, what can actually be changed, through education, justice, is what's relevant. Calling Muhammed a pedophile makes as much sense as calling anyone, throughout time, regardless of nationality, a pedophile. Pedophilia in the clinical sense of the word is not a judgement call, nor does it mean the person is breaking a law or social code necessarily. It means they have a sexual attraction to children. As you go throughout history you'll find various reasons why this is so, and the contexts will be different.

"Very true. The Swiss foreign wealth management branch has been pronounced dead over and over again since the 1930s, but the financial sector always had all the lobbying power and technical expertise it needs (together with a very complacent political class and a public that doesn't care) to insert all the loopholes they want in any legislation they want. It's mostly a PR exercise to say ""look, now we're clean"". While they certainly felt the heat, and had to endure cuts, the story is far from over",196
"You don't know what you're talking about.

The definition of a planet isn't arbitrarily defined by ""do we have pretty pictures of it, or does it have an atmosphere?"". 

The definition of a planet had to be more clearly defined to account for the presence of a number of newly discovered Trans-Neptunian and Kuiper Belt objects. The most well known of which today are Eris, Makemake, Haumea, Sedna, Orcus, and Quaoar. Under the old classification system Ceres, which lies in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, could have also been considered a planet. 

The problem was/is, that as telescopes get better and better, the rate at which Kuiper Belt Objects are being found continues to increase, thus it was deemed necessary by scientists at the IAU, that they needed to further refine the criteria that determined what a planet was and wasn't, in order to prevent our solar system from suddenly having a anywhere from fifty to a few hundred new ""planets"".  

So, in 2006 they added a third criteria to the two that were previously in place.
 
* 1) Must orbit the sun.
* 2) Must have sufficient mass to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium.
* 3) *Must have cleared its orbit (neighborhood) of other massive debris.* 

There are still problems with the third criteria, because Neptune and Pluto occasionally change places in the solar system which could be argued that Neptune hasn't cleared it's own orbit. (Also lagrange points) 

That being said, this is how science works. As more and more discoveries are made, the systems used to classify them must be continually refined. You argument if placed in a different context, could be the same as someone complaining that they wanted Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus to remain in the same classification *so science should do away with the biological classification of ""species""*, and just stop at genus.  

Also Brown didn't posit the ""theory"" of Planet X. Planet X was the name given to an as of then undiscovered planet whose existence was hypothesized in 1781, as an explanation for the disturbances in the orbit of Uranus. This led to the discovery of Neptune in 1846, and Pluto in 1930. 

Today, Planet X is a fictional planet posited to exist only by conspiracy theorists. Neither it, Nemisis, or Nibiru are real. We've already found tons of other objects in the Kuiper belt, and ""Planet X"" isn't one of them. It's the just the nickname name given to Neptune and Pluto, before they were discovered.

"I'd recommend reading the history of the Frankfurt School.  Frankly this stuff sounds like a conspiracy theory when you don't hear it from the horses mouth.

But [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6c_dinY3fM) does a reasonable job of presenting the concept in context.  Hold your nose for the first few minutes - the guy is rather partisan, but there's a point to his buildup.  But his breakdown of critical theory and political correctness is spot-on.

In short: 'Critical Theory' is taking society's healthy willingness for self-reflection and improvement, and hijacking that immune system into an auto-immune disease.  Repeatedly criticize every facet of society. Make society responsible for every current and past wrong.  Never demand a solution, just criticize.  Criticize until a secular sense of original sin - that we are born guilty and dirty and oppressive - is worked into the mindset of the culture itself. 

Keep it up for a few decades.  Once you work this reflexive guilt and self-derision of the culture *into* the culture, people will naturally push it on it's own.  It's like a cancer.  The result is Political Correctness, and at the extreme end, the SJW crowd.  Nobody *dictates* what is politically correct or not.  It's not a grand conspiracy with evil people in the shadows.  It's just an insidious attitude of thought that propagates itself once started.  Because there's always a moral high-ground, and status to be gained, from being *oh so smart* enough to criticize one's own society.

The end goal being to have the culture undermine it's own validity - attack its root morality from all sides until the culture implodes on itself. Paving the war for a communist revolution *yadda yadda yadda stupid communist ideas yadda yadda yadda.*

Whether it accomplishes their goal or not is irrelevant , the devastating effects of turning a culture in on itself are real enough.  Even though I personally hate Trump -  it's pretty obvious why headlines like the one from this thread bump up his popularity.  He's promising to be the Radiation; the Chemotherapy.

In Sweden, for instance, which like Germany has had an open door, 71 percent of all asylum applicants in 2015 were men. Among the mostly-late-teenage category of “unaccompanied minors,” as Valerie Hudson points out in an important essay for Politico,” the ratios were even more skewed: “11.3 boys for every one girl.”


[**With present flow of 90% male refugee children to Sweden, the Swedish Teen Sex Ratio will in 4 months be like in China: 120 boys/100 girls.**](https://twitter.com/HansRosling/status/669678035654852608)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling


July 2014 est. for Swedish population (bare in mind, these numbers might not include non-citizens at july 2014, i'm not sure):


* 0-14 years: 16.9% (male 847,611/female 800,213)

* **15-24 years: 12.3% (male 617,054/female 582,755)** 

* 25-54 years: 39.2% (male 1,937,091/female 1,872,070) 

* 55-64 years: 11.7% (male 571,079/female 568,093) 

* 65 years and over: 19.8% (male 882,653/female 1,045,190) (2014 est.)


[**Registered Asylum Seekers in Sweden, in 2015**](http://imgur.com/biqeCuX)  -  [Here's my source](http://www.migrationsverket.se/download/18.7c00d8e6143101d166d1aab/1451894593595/Inkomna+ans%C3%B6kningar+om+asyl+2015+-+Applications+for+asylum+received+2015.pdf)

So, based on these numbers, in 2015 alone Sweden added **42762** more men than women to the age group 13-24 (let's make it a cool **60 000** more men since July 2014) where we already had 34299 more men than women.


So, we can safely affirm that **at this very moment**, in the age group 15-24 or 13-24, **Sweden has roughly 100 000 more men than women** in a population total of ~ 1 300 000. There are 100 000 men who will **never** get any sexual or emotional satisfaction.


What's more, there is one basic truth in life which is impossible to quantify in any number:

1. Women, regardless of race, ethnicity or religion are genetically *programmed* to value financial and emotional security above all; and career women who are financially independent have no respect for men who aren't. The vast majority of us, men or women, want to marry **up**, not down, as Chinese say.

2. Sweden has 100 000 men at the very bottom of society who barely speak English, let alone Swedish, don't have any job or prospects, own no property and have a terrible attitude towards women.


All of this is now, at the beginning of 2016. Just project the same trend over another 3-4 years. Will it be 200 000 single men at the bottom of society? What does that even do to country?


How does the conversation on a date between an *asylum seeker* and a woman working in corporate-Sweden go?

- Would you like to adopt a grown man who thinks he's superior to you based on nothing else other than his genitalia?

- Would you house him, cook for and feed him, clothe him etc; and if you do he feels emasculated, powerless and inferior to a woman so he occasionally takes a fist to your face?

*Good luck with that, Swedish women.*

Such a well-written article. I had no idea German population was just 10 million in the 20-something range.

"Yes, you can work for a salary on top of it - a lot or a little - whatever suits you best. 

The important part to consider is that the government probably spends *more* than this (on average) per person. 

This is because a considerable amount of welfare and pensions goes to bureaucracy and compliance. There is also an increasing amount of middle class welfare in most modern democratic states. 

Giving every person a set amount - regardless of their situation (sick, healthy, unemployed, old, pregnant, injured) - cuts out a *massive* amount of administration expenses and fraud. 

It also frees people up to do different things - like start a new business, pursue higher education, change jobs, have children, care for elderly parents, look after their health, escape abusive relationships, or other (often economically beneficial) activities.

I recommend the documentary to everyone, it's easy to google.

They were so happy and thankful when they finally landed there. They could speak broken Slovak and their kids already knew how to play the Slovak anthem on various instruments.

"In December, William Binney told Washington's Blog:

-------------

If you want to get into the real reason politicians, companies and agencies are hard over advocates for mass/bulk surveillance, then you need to look at all the money involved. It’s about 100 Billion (that’s with a B) per year.

When NSA Director Alexander said their objective is to “collect it all”, then that simply exposed the underlying reason for all this spying. That committed the government to collecting an ever increasing year-by-year amount of data which takes an ever increasing year-by-year amount of money to do. And to achieve that, they use fear mongering and lies to mislead and bamboozle us into letting them take more and more of our money to achieve very little. [Background.]

So, every time there is a terrorist attack, what we really need to do is demand that they cut the budgets of all the intelligence agencies. And, if they still keep failing, then we need to get rid of them and start the process again with new agencies and new managers. It could be as simple are removing the top 4 layers of management at an agency and replacing them with external people drawn from professional ranks not related to politics or government.

Mass collection on everybody, of course, makes government (including FBI, DEA, DHS, IRS, CIA …) all knowing like a J. Edger Hoover on super steroids or an all knowing Stasi with more complete, accurate, timely, mineable/interrogateable, stored electronic files. This does make the government all knowing and in a position to manipulate and control people just like the KGB or the Stasi did.  [Background.]

Also, it represents a total flip of the founding principles of our country. We were supposed to know what the government was doing in our name; the government was not supposed to know what we were doing unless they had probable cause to look at us. [Background here, here and here.]

But, that takes a mainstream media that wants to do their job and keep the public informed.

"I'm Somali-American and this is a problem that we've been fighting in our community in the United States. 

Misogyny, rape culture, and even racism are global problems. They take on different and unique forms depending on where you live. In Somali culture, victim blaming is a common reaction and reporting rape often leads to the shaming of the victim far too often. 

Female genital mutilation is a disgusting habit that is far too common in Somalia. Lighter skinned Somalis with straight hair are the epitome of Somali beauty, while dark skin is cause for derision and exclusion. There are countless problems just as in any community and they each deserve intense scrutiny.

The problem is how the fuck do you address this? As a Somali person myself, I will have a much easier time criticizing my community. Still, I can definitely count on people dismissing me as someone who has turned on my people if I constantly point at their problems. 

However, how can an outsider approach these topics that affect everyone? I think it requires a level of cultural sensitivity that even I  try to be aware of. When it comes to something as universally abhorrent as rape, it seems unnecessary to tiptoe around this conversation. In fact, I often lose my temper when I hear people use ridiculous arguments such as your example that is far too common. 

I think the best way really is to collaborate with people who are members of the communities that realize the problems. Human beings are stubborn and resistant to change. 

When an outsider calls for a necessary change, they can easily dismiss that person as a hateful racist attacking our good culture and religion. Even as an insider, I am constantly questioned about my allegiance. So, it honestly is a lot more productive to circumvent the bullshit excuses by working with people who have credibility and a voice in the community. 

Pointing out the ugly parts of other cultures can quickly become racist if it is done haphazardly. If the argument becomes one where you blame all Muslims for allowing rape, then you lose your audience and gain a lot of backlash instead. 

Every culture has problems with rape, misogyny, etc... So if you are pointing fingers without making the effort to work with Muslims and avoid attacking the culture as a whole, then you're going to be called a racist. 

**In summary, being friends of the Muslim community and working with credible community leaders would be the effective, ~~non-racist~~ tolerant way to fix these problems.**

[Japan Tries Women-Only Train Cars to Stop Groping](http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/International/story?id=803965)

4.) Get the states to actually take back the people. How many of the state are going to accept citizens that do not want to be there? How many of the refugee are going to admit where they are from?

&gt;“In the end, this is not a case about the scope of expression in a comedy performance or an artistic performance,” he wrote. “It is about verbal and physical abuse that amounts to adverse treatment based on sex and sexual orientation.”

I mean really people, this is pretty cut and dry. While I do think Lorna is being overly sensitive, you can't fucking say shit like that - even in a comedy club.

**EDIT 2:**

I have things I have to do today, lol. I'm just going to copy paste another comment I posted:

So Freedom of Expression is covered in our [Charter of Rights and Freedoms](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html), as well as the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/). The article I linked goes over this in concerns for Canada Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The key here from the article is:

&gt;Even with these limits, the Canadian hate law still clearly curtails free expression. But the Supreme Court has not struck it down. Why? Four main reasons. First, our constitution protects not only free expression, but multiculturalism and equality as well. So to read the constitution holistically, we cannot permit one protected freedom to undermine other rights and freedoms enjoying equal status.
&gt;
&gt;Second, the Supreme Court recognized the insidious impact of propaganda campaigns that gain social traction and incrementally dull our rational faculties and empathy. Perhaps paternalistic, but the court is saying sometimes we need to be protected from our baser and stupider selves.
&gt;
&gt;Third, the courts have said that even if a hate speech prohibition is never used, it has symbolic value, like that framed mission and values statement on the wall of most businesses, that stares silently down at the workers while they work.
&gt;
&gt;Fourth, hate speech has no redeeming value.

The Article does a better job of explaining the sentiments behind our legislation against hate speech better than I could. You should read it over.

As for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights I'd argue in this case that the comedian, by attacking Lorna's sexuality in a comedy club, violated article 27

&gt;(1) Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.

and article 29

&gt;(1) Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.

Now I do think the decision was a little heavy handed, but it does seem to be pretty cut and dry on this one. You can't single out and target someone for their sexuality, even if they were being inconsiderate in a comedy club. Does shaming and embarrassing inconsiderate audience members happen all the time in comedy clubs? Yup. Is it socially acceptable in comedy clubs to blast shitty patrons? Sure. Does that mean it's ok? Well the courts decided it was not.

The reasons why have never been entirely clear, but the common perception amongst Britons is that the establishment is afraid of upsetting minorities. (""The PC Brigade"", so to speak.) 

This was then followed by Muslim leaders declaring that it was far too common amongst Muslim communities and all mosques should strive to teach that raping children is not acceptable. (Gee, you don't say?)

"Been a commercial fisherman in BC for almost ten years and can attest that the industry is far more complicated than it's given credit for. The regulations in Canada are pretty strict for those of us with licenses. And at least with some fish stock I think we've seen a positive impact from regulations started in the 90's. But just like any beaurocracy, these regulations are often nonsensical and counter-intuitive to the fisherman. One  thing that will be interesting to see play out is that like in the article the government here is buying back boats and licenses, which has made it nearly impossible now to enter the industry. This is a good thing in my opinion. But the result has been that there are hardly any fisherman between the ages of 25-35. Totally lost generation. When fishing in BC dipped in the 90's everyone left and no one entered. Now we have a fleet of vessels where all of the captains are 50+ years and no one is coming up to replace them. And to be a fishing captain is an incredibly stressful and knowledgeable job. They know our waters, are responsible for safety and the ridiculous amount of maintenance that accompanies any seafaring vessel. We try to adhere to every regulation and yet still I've gone out multiple seasons and made next to no money. I'll probably get railed for saying this. But the overfishing here is now mostly perpetrated by scumbag native individuals. Who take out their government given boats and licenses and go string their net outside the mouth of a river. And too often they claim that they are catching food for their band, then you see a guy in his pick up truck with a bed full of salmon selling it for 5$ fish. They're not all like that at all.

"You're probably falling for a political lie and the police isn't at fault.

Politicians blamed the police to avoid taking responsibility themselves. Reinforcements were called but they didn't get any - in part because police forces from Cologne were unavailable due to being used in Bavaria for migrant registration.

Interviews with some of those involved reveal that there were 2000-3000 angry arabs at the scene, many of which built mobs to interfere with the police work, which they still attempted to carry out as well as they could. They were probably not in a position to use more force due to the sheer numbers, or they'd have been lynched.

There may be more details that I've forgotten, but later reports don't sound like the police were at fault at all. The politicians - as well as police leadership, which is a rather political position as well - started out telling lies to downplay the situation, which is only now being cleared up.

Another thing that politicians lied about was that it was people of ""North African"" descent, and that they probably don't have anything to do with the refugees, while today it was revealed that it was in fact mostly Syrians who the police dealt with (yes, they got some persons out of the crowd and took their personal details).

"contrary to popular belief, she wasn't dedicated to alleviating the suffering of people. she thought that suffering is holy, and, to put it simply, ""good"".

quote from wikipedia:

&gt;Mother Teresa devoutly believed that suffering – even when caused by poverty, medical problems, or starvation – was a gift from God; as a result, while her clinics received millions of dollars in donations, their conditions drew criticism from people disturbed by the shortage of medical care, systematic diagnosis, and necessary nutrition, as well as the scarcity of analgesics for those in pain.[105][106][107] Many of her critics accused her of a fundamental contradiction: It was estimated that she raised over $100 million for her charity, yet only 5-7% of this was used in catering to the poor. Some have argued that the additional money could have had transformative effects on the health of the poor by creating advanced palliative care facilities in the city.[108][109]",124

You have to be a special ~~lever~~ Level of stupid to decide to go to one of the most lawless, devout muslim countries in the world and attempt to spread the world of Jesus.

I know in Korea, it's basically the opposite to Europe in that the Catholics in Korea are humble nice people that don't push their religion whereas the pres. church is huge and goes as far as to make their followers disclose their paystatements so they can decide how much each follower can donate.

The best way to think about DPRK is as ferocious, crazy and weak. They'll push aggressiveness to its max but always, calculatedly, fall short of military initiation. As a result, the US and SK oscillates between being responsive to ignoring the DPRK provocations entirely. The fact that the DPRK has conducted four tests in over a decade is not entirely frightening, these guys aren't getting much help from outside and have to learn most lessons from scratch. Four tests in ten years is weak. That's why it's taking them so long to field a viable weapon. Plus its an extremely poor country so it's hard to funnel money into a nuclear programme (even though they put every available cent into it, including from our aid). 

The thing about nuclear weapons is that they have to be repeatable and reliable to be a threat. A hydrogen bomb is much more difficult to explode than other materials too, limiting their repeatability. The US and USSR conducted thousands of tests before they were ready to field their weapons, the DPRK has conducted only four. So even if they had a weapon, they couldn't be sure it would explode in combat. 

If they did have a reliable and viable nuclear device, it would then have to be weaponised (responsive to remote commands) and miniaturised (to fit on a ballistic missile/warhead). That is an incredibly difficult process. This device is probably very crude and nowhere near that stage. That part also requires a mature ICBM programme so the device can be mounted on a reliable rocket system. And rocket programmes are notoriously difficult to maintain even for superpowers. But this is why we watch their ballistic missile tests closely (including their space programme because the  same rockets are used in each). So far the weaponisation, miniaturisation and rocket mounting is non-existent in the DPRK. That's as far as the intelligence tells us anyway. 

So long story short, the US and SK (and Japan) will be interested in seeing the data from the reports to assess what might need to change in their threat calculation, but I doubt they expect the DPRK to be suddenly a viable nuclear power with a deliverable weapon. If the regime will ever get to that point, it's probably at least a decade away (if it doesn't collapse in the meantime, which is where my money is).

edit: I'm taking about miniaturization and mounting a nuclear weapon on an ICBM. The stress a weapon goes through in launch and re-entry is intense. It takes a lot of tests for both a weapon and a delivery system to overcome those obstacles. It's easy to have something go boom, but to deliver it to a target in the modern era, something both the US and USSR could do decades ago, requires a lot of tests.

"&gt; The asylum seekers usually destroy their documents

I really don't understand how this one got started.

1. Example: If you can **PROVE** that you are from Syria, you are granted asylum due to the conditions in Syria. It is **EXTREMELY** beneficial to be able to prove that you are from Syria!

2. If you are paperless you will have to **prove** where you are from. The baseline is ""if you can't prove where you're from, you have no reason to be here"", not ""if you can't prove where you are from, we don't know where to send you back"". The goal of the state is then to figure out where you are from, and send you back. This is most commonly done in interviews where you have an **interpreter** from the alleged place of origin, an example would be an American immigrant in Sweden. They would then be in an interview with an American interpreter. Just like you can hear if someone's from Texas or California, they can hear if this person should reasonably be from the place they claim to be.

3. In the case that the home state has a functioning state, a request is made to verify the claims of the immigrant, usually in terms of registration of residence.

There is a lot of funny business going on with immigration (claiming to be from certain more war ravaged provinces of a nation, but in reality you are from the untouched parts etc.), but please fact check before adding to the propaganda.

&gt; And in the unlikely event that you actually deport them then what is to stop them from returning?

Fingerprints are taken of asylum seekers. If they return without changed conditions, the old ruling (if they left most likely a negative ruling) still stands.

I think you and I would agree that the crisis prompted some kind of humanitarian reply.  The free-for-all that developed subsequently meant that the scheme was mismanaged, and that people who were perhaps less deserving than others were assisted.

Strangely it seems those who believe in migration and the importance of humanitarian obligations regarding those in war-torn areas are the ones most eager to suppress debate.  Suppressing the problems will only embolden and strengthen their enemies.  There are plenty of actors out there willing to make hay from this political crisis.

Japan is going to be a lot better off in the long term for not taking in refugees and having a dwindling population because automation will inevitably replace many low skill jobs.

People were relying on the sale of those things to keep going. It may not stop poaching but if you're in poaching for money and not the glee of killing animals, and you're not getting a payday, you'll hopefully move onto more lucrative operations.

"The Islamic Republic is best understood as a competition between two broad factions, both fiercely nationalistic, but with a fundamental disagreement concerning the current international order: is Iran to join the international community, or upend it?

For most of Islamic Republic's history, the hardliners, fanatics, Khomeinists - whatever you want to call them - held control, usually through unrelenting brutality. Starting with President Khatami election in 1997, however, Iran's western oriented, Tehran based middle class has made it overwhelmingly clear that they want Iran to be a country, not a cause. That means normal relations with the West, a marketplace of ideas, and no more funding for Hamas and Hezbollah. The Khomeinists are still bent on ending the post-WW2 international order, and ushering in a new age of Islamic reasoning and rule (read any one of Ahmadinejad's UN addresses). The Khomeinists also showed no compunction about assassinating Khatami's friends and allies when he was President; Mousavi is still under house arrest; and of course no one should forget that the Green Movement was stopped by horrific violence.

To get to the point: both factions agree that lifting sanctions against Iran are in Iran's short term national interests. What to do after that is an area of wild disagreement. It may very well be that moderates can show trade and engagement is a good thing, and draw Iran into the community of nations. It may very well be that the hardliners unleash another wave of terror, use the influx of cash to fund terrorism, and proceed to cheat on the deal. Any commentary stating the deal is a success or failure at this point is premature and ill-informed.

"OK, I see this on reddit more and more and I want to chime in. Please don't crucify me. 

Like it or not, the people supporting trump are nowhere to be seen on the parts of the internet you visit. You have no discussions with them, and from all the information you consume, you cannot understand their perspective... yet at the same time, you know they number millions.

There are two possibilities, either they are insane and have not become enlightened by seeing the world of information that is available at all, or that both of your groups are in your own little bubbles of the internet and mass media, and both of which are constantly maligning the other in similar ways. aka they view you as badly as you view them.

**As a trump supporter**(this is why I said don't crucify me), let me answer your first question(I won't answer both because that second question would take a book). I will try my very best to be as unbiased as possible and help you understand the mindset of other trump supporters besides myself, even if showing this at its core is not flattering.

&gt; 1 : How is Trump so popular ? I know hate speech is rising here and there, but Trump's is much more simplistic and should be more easily debunked, even by not so smart voters.

Trump is a lot of things, but he is not hate speech. If you do not agree, please consider that the standard of hate speech is very different among different people. In particular, to politically-correct people, anything that disagrees with them is hate-speech. 

To trump supporters, this is not an exaggeration. Political correctness has become a religion. And heresy towards PC de-facto becomes national tragedy and drama. The leftist side actively weaponizes this atmosphere of self-righteousness by playing the PC card at every opportunity that they can. Trump's statements were often crude, but when we heard them through the headlines of mass-media, you know that supposedly ""respected"" and unbiased news outlets were exaggerating and maligning these statements beyond reason. All for the crime of offending PC.

To a trump supporter, this is disgusting, and the hostile attacks and treatment trump is receiving from the leftist media is one they themselves have been receiving even for their benign viewpoints. As a result, they have let go of trying to appease leftists, they are in open rebellion against the status quo, as far as political correctness is concerned.

To them, Trump is just a mildly crude version of saying the truth. And if you really examine what he says, it is all not that unreasonable. Go to his website and find me racism, for example.",210

&gt;Russia's Foreign Ministry says Moscow does not consider the conclusions of a British inquiry into the 2006 poisoning death of a former Russian spy to be impartial because it claims the result had been predetermined.

&gt;Spokeswoman Maria Zhakarova says in a statement Thursday that ""we regret that a purely criminal case has been politicized and has darkened the general atmosphere of bilateral relations.""

&gt;Zhakarova adds ""clearly the decision to suspend the coroner's inquest and begin 'public hearings' was politically motivated.""

A rather muted response from Russia, all things considered. It would tie into the fact that the British government is reportedly reluctant to establish new sanctions on Russia and this probably won't go much further. It's not something Putin could ever get away with again, it's a one-off move that sent a pretty chilling message to Russian dissidents.

The OCP has probably contributed hugely to the rapid economic development of China. If the same policy could be instituted in Africa for a few decades, it would rescue hundreds of millions of humans from poverty. But, as so often, ideology seems more important than actual people. It's sad.

Couple of facts on the OCP: country side people were always allowed to have a second child, if the first is a girl.

"The thing that spooks me about the refugee rapists is not so much the rape as it is the group coordination of it.

It takes planning, organized behavior, and maybe even a little training to get any group activity going.  That likely means these refugees decided that that they were going to meet up somewhere where, they were thinking about before hand where vulnerable women would be, and they had found some friends that they were not just comfortable getting naked and having sex with, but they had friends who would cheer them on as they raped.

And even if this was truly spontaneous, then that means that this behavior is wide spread and they are so nonchalant enough about rape that they know what to do when the signals are correct.  These guys are about as ready to rape a woman as a typical Westerner is ready to politely go through a buffet or que on to a bus.

I am curious about this....

Why do we care so much about Iran working on Nuclear weapons, but all the while we have a sociopathic power mongerer in North Korea who not only has fission bombs, but he is also working toward fusion bombs and claims to have recently tested one (Even tough we know it is probably BS).

But we talk about invading Iraq, and just keep laughing at North Korea, while they threaten to bomb us, invade South Korea, and pretty much sling nukes everywhere.

I know they do not have ICBMs at the moment, but let's face it, the Republicans are all standing with Israel being the target of Iran bombs, right?  It is not likely Iran would threaten to launch nuclear wepons at the US, at least not right away, this is all about Israel.

Fuck them, absolutely.

But judges Marie Deschamps, Hassan Bubacar Jallow, Yasmin Louise Sooka, and everyone else working under the panel assembled by Ban Ki-Moon? Fucking praises to the lot of them! Plus, of course, Anders Kompass himself.   
Understand, when the article says:

&gt;""Recognising Kompass’s seniority, extensive experience in field missions and the fact that human rights officials had not followed up the allegations despite the need for urgent action, the panel report said they could make no adverse finding against him.""

That doesn't mean ""they tried as hard as they could, but didn't manage to find any rules he had actually broken,"" or anything. Far from it.  
It means that, **despite** his unquestionable violation of confidentiality protocols and the like, they essentially said ""Fuck it, there are rules, and then there is what's right and what's wrong. Anders Kompass? He did nothing wrong, it was you* who failed him and the victims of the abuse. Therefore we conclude, on the basis of the inaction of his superiors, that Kompass had the authority to make the decision to release this information to the French government.""

---

\* Specifically, the fired/forcefully retired former Chief of OIOS Carman Lapointe for her role initiating the actions against Kompass^([1]), the fired/forcefully retired former Head of MINUSCA General Babacar Gaye of Senegal for the abuse which occurred under his command^([2]), the mission’s director of the U.N.’s Human Rights and Justice Section Renner Onana, as well as Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Hervé Ladsous, High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid bin Ra'ad, and former Director of the Ethics Office Joan Dubinsky for passing the report between one another, each claiming it fell under the jurisdiction of another^([3]).  

[1] Zeid bin Ra'ad also initiated action against him as well. However, due to his position as head of Human Rights, the names and personal information of the victims sexual abuse being released in a manner which violates confidentiality is obviously a situation which he's obligated to address. 

[2] Which didn't actually constitute *all* the abuse, but the UN doesn't have the authority to take action against whoever was previously in charge of the camp as part of the French Military's Operation Sangaris, or against the French military officers in Bangui who were previously informed -without the confidential details specifying the victims- under the UN's Sangaris Report that sexual abuses were occurring under their command.

[3] My understanding is that it primarily revolved around Zeid and eventually Dubinsky passing the report to Ladsous, expecting him to carry out disciplinary action against the perpetrators then hand them over to the French government, and Ladsous passing the report to either Zeid or Dubinsky in turn, with the expectation that the matter would be processed through the International Criminal Court under Article 7 of the Rome Statute (which pertains to crimes against humanity, including rape).  
This understanding is far more tenuous than anything else I've written, though, to take it with a grain of salt.

"I've spent a significant time in the last 15 years in many of the countries that these asylum seekers are coming from, notably Afghanistan. The thing is, none of this surprises me, and not because these are bad people. In fact, the vast majority of people that I interacted with in these countries are no more evil than people in western countries. Some days, I think even less so, but that's another debate.

The thing that I believe many people just have a hard time wrapping their heads around is how diametrically different local culture is to ours. In terms of equality, freedom, civil rights, democracy etc our culture has evolved in a truly profound way in the last century/couple of centuries. 

Due to this, it becomes increasingly difficult for these people to understand or relate to our norms, but it also becomes increasingly difficult for us to fathom why other people have so much trouble embracing our norms.

I remember one day having been invited to a man's house, and while he was sending his son to the kitchen to get the drinks and food his wife and daughters had prepared (it would have been improper for any of the women in his family to even serve us), he started telling me how important women rights were for him and how it was great that the west was doing so much. Thinking about it, I realized that this person genuinely thought that he was a paragon of women's rights, and in his society he really would have been considered one, but by our norms even his ideals were patriarchal and bigotted.

The thing is, in many of these societies women have comparable rights and status to dogs in our society. You're expected to take care of your dog and not mistreat it, but at the end of the day it's your property and you do whatever you please with it. There are some people who think dogs should be taken care of, and there are even groups that call for equal rights (PETA) but they are viewed as fringe and extremists.

When we went in to namely Afghanistan, starting all these programs and throwing money around, it's a little bit as if some country came to us throwing money around and started all these programs for dogs. Doggy university, doggy police programs (I guess that already exists), dogs in governement. As long as money is being thrown around, you don't care, let them do their thing. But to you, your dog's your dog, and though these weird people may be putting an outfit on him and sending him to work, he's still only a dog to you. The day these people leave and the money stops being thrown around, your dog will go back to being a dog, hanging out on the couch licking his balls while you watch TV. 

Now imagine that you end up living in this foreign country. There are dogs everywhere and people are telling you: ""These dogs are actually just like us."" Do you really think you can begin to imagine these dogs being your equal?

Ok enough with the metaphor. But seriously, to a lot of these people the idea of women having rights is simply ridiculous. But there's more. To many of these men, who have lived in a society where they have been forced to sexually repress themselves, the west is seen as a not only financial but also a sexual El Dorado. They have heard stories about how women are ""loose and easy"" and how all western women want sex. Coming from a society where many women are essentially hidden and never talk to non-family men, and coming to our society and having women dress and act in ways that we would consider as normal, is to these men the same as a women in a bikini staring at us and licking her lips is for us. The culture gap is just that big.

It's when you combine these things, the lack of cultural belief that women are equals and the belief that all western women are dirty whores that you really get a powder keg. 

Sometimes my young nieces in nephews will do something in public that isn't appropriate, and you have to tell them ""no you can't do that, that's not ok."" When you tell them that, they often have a bit of a confused look, as if saying ""really I didn't know that."" In many ways I feel like these migrants are the same. 

The cultural gap is simply too wide, and integration either isn't possible, or will require a lot of time and patience for each person. Now however, there is such an influx that this just isn't possible. It's like having special need kids. You need more staff to help them along, and if you have that special attention then it can work. But instead we are dropping hundreds of them into a one teacher classroom and acting surprised when there is pandemonium.

Edit: Double gilded! Thanks so much kind strangers!

Edit 2: Triple Gilded! Thanks so much! This comment really blew up. As such, I wanted to add a little bit, because I've been reading a lot of replies and thinking about things. The dog metaphor was imperfect, and I'd like to refine it a bit. I think it would have been more appropriate to say animals in general. If there was a society that interacted with us, that had essentially completely taken on the ideals of PETA, had given legal and cultural equal rights to all animals, and they looked at us. I mean we have our slaughterhouses, hunting, exterminators etc etc.... Of course to us it's just how we function. I mean I'm aware that it's an imperfect system, that animals are mistreated. I've seen the documentaries, the videos online... but I love a good steak or a home made bacon cheese burger. I really think that that society would look at us and simply not understand how we can be so barbaric, in the same way that I, an individual who believes in absolute gender, religious, sexual, etc equality cannot understand the lack of equality in these countries and cultures. Now I'm not saying it's ok, I'm just noting the extent of the gap that exists. With this metaphor I was personally thinking more about how all the programs forcing change onto countries like Afghanistan, like forcing an equal number of women in government positions or creating these all women police or army units that unfortunately were nothing more than an amusement for most of the other police and army units, these programs are bound to fail in the same way that if members of this fictionally society came to where I lived, and started giving me money to only eat tofu, and supplying me with a ton of vegan alternative foods for free, then maybe for a while I would become vegan, but if they ever left and I had no incentive, I would probably just start eating meat again.

As for explaining why there are these sexual assaults, I don't think the metaphor is enough. I think it is a piece of a complicated puzzle, that is completed by the fact that there is a lost generation of men coming out of these countries, that not only does not view women as equals but is completely torn between their traditional societies and globalization, that has grown up in civil unrest and a deep misunderstanding of both their own traditions and what is real about the west.

"I'm open to being proved wrong, but I HIGHLY doubt they have developed a two-stage weapon. The difference between two-stage nukes and pure fission ones is like the difference between fission bombs and a chemical bomb. For a country with the resources of NK to have gone from their first partially successful fission test to a working, miniaturized two stage device in just a few years and with just two development tests in between strikes me as virtually impossible, highly improbable even for a developed nation.

Two-stage thermonuclear weapons are some of the most complicated machines for their size ever built. I have a thermal physics undergrad and mechanical engineering masters, two subjects that specifically relate to the functioning principles of these weapons, yet despite years of interest and research nothing beyond the fundamental design and materials of these devices has revealed itself to me. These weapons took the smartest and most powerful nations in the world decades and enormous sums of money to develop, with nearly constant testing all the while.

Let me give an example of how hard it is to build these things. After the US stopped production of nuclear weapons in the late 80's, a lot of the specific knowledge of how to build them was buried for security reasons and inevitably something was lost, but thankfully it was only the procedure for creating the foam filler that surrounds the primary and secondary within the uranium casing. How long do you think it took our scientists to rediscover the method of producing this foam? Weeks? Months? No, [it took over a decade.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOGBANK) We only rediscovered how to produce it in 2007, and that's because we still don't completely understand the complex behavior of all these materials working in conjunction when these things detonate.

However, Rawls also insists, like Popper, that society has a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance: **""While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.""[2]**

we can welcome people from intolerant societies

if they become tolerant, then everything is ok. if they continue their intolerance, we have a right to exclude them or jail them for committing transgressive acts

tolerance is not infinite

in fact, for tolerance to exist, intolerance of intolerance is a cornerstone need

but i do believe some fools think you can never act against the intolerant if the intolerant are from outside your society, because you cannot judge them out of some hesitance to judge others. oh but you can judge them, and you should. they are not aliens, they are fellow human beings. it does not matter their cultural background, what matters is their behavior, and if it is transgressive, it needs to stop

Chinese production was below expectation last year, and there are more pessimistic estimates for the coming year.  China had around an 8% industrial production growth rate, far above the world average.  But a few years back they had double digit growth rates.  So it is still quickly growing, but the rate at which it is growing has been steadily decreasing at least over the last 4 years or so.

Add to that you have a question of debt and the housing bubble.  The government is rapidly becoming more indebted largely to shore up instability because so much of the wealth was based on real estate.

China basically put a lot of their money in real estate and manufacturing, and those two things both aren't doing well.

Dottore Klaus Meier, L.L.M, professor of law at Frankfurt University, said ""It is disturbing to see Muslims face continued systematic oppression within the criminal justice system, especially when the vast majority of refugees are law-abiding.

"This isn't true. 

From the earliest foreign policy conceptions under Putin, super power status has not been on the agenda. 

It runs contrary to the grand strategy driving Russian foreign policy. 

The first aspect of its grand strategy is its regional strategy of Eurasianism. This has been pursued consistently by Putin's administrations since 2000 and the central idea has been to establish Russia as the dominant power in the region. It's done this economically by expanding oil production and transmission, pipeline projects, by expanding the role of the CIS, by establishing/expanding its custom union programs and with the formal implementation of the Eurasian Economic Union. 

Moves like the pseudo-annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and the formal annexation of Crimea are linked to the strategy of Eurasianism - Russia demonstrating its willingness to act to protect its security interests within its region. 

All of this contributes to a broader global strategy of undermining U.S. global power - by attempting to unite the Eurasian region with Russia it keeps a region with great economic potential and geopolitical significance out of America's control. Moves like intervening in Georgia and annexing Crimea are also about more than just Russian security - they signal to the U.S. and the global community that Russian national interest comes before international obligations (which is in the process of becoming law in Russia). And finally, its intervention in Syria (its first mid to long-term international commitment since the fall of the USSR) demonstrates willingness to directly challenge the U.S. hard power (rather than its soft power, which it has consistently challenged in the UN).

This is part of Russia's quest for a **""multipolar"" world order** - or more specifically, a regional-multipolar world system. 

What Russia has aimed to do - particularly through its promotion of the BRICS group - is create a system where the distribution of global power is more equitable, to prevent any one group (whether it be the U.S. or China) from being able to act with impunity in the international arena and to protect a sovereign nation's right to defend its national interests in its region.

Russia realised long ago that reclaiming superpower status would be impossible. So instead it went about creating a new global infrastructure in an attempt to balance U.S. global power and influence.

This is why many in the Russian administration may appear to long for the Soviet times. During the Cold War, there was *bipolarity* - the U.S. was balanced against the USSR and neither could act effectively in the international sphere without considering how the other would react. Many international security theorists have argued that the bipolar system was far more stable than the current pseudo-unipolar system. The U.S. has no effective ""checks"" on its power - the only thing that really prevents the U.S. from acting unilaterally is its own domestic system. 

And while it's good that it is limited to some extent, that extent isn't really enough. The government can and will circumvent the process of public approval and readily lie to its people if it has embarked upon a course of action it wants to see through. Think of Iraq. 

Of course, the U.S. has lost a significant amount of credibility (soft power) since Iraq and nations are far more skeptical about getting involved with the U.S., but that doesn't necessarily matter because with the way the current system operates no nation will actively oppose U.S. action because the U.S. is disproportionally more powerful. Moreover, other regional powers are more likely to align with the U.S. than remain neutral because of ""bandwagoning""; they want to share in the spoils of the assumed victory. 

That makes it very hard for anyone to actually challenge the system. Many in Europe are opposed to it, but they are too economically reliant on the U.S. to make any decisive stand against it. 

Russia, on the other hand, has been willing to make itself the outcast by challenging the U.S. status-quo. 

China has been willing to challenge the U.S. by staking its claim over regional assets. **Like Russia, China is more concerned with defending its national interests, not getting involved in every global conflict simply because it can**. 

India, another BRICS member, is still coming to terms with its global influence. However, India was the first major country to recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea. This isn't necessarily India standing in solidarity with Russia, but more a case of India standing up against the status-quo. 

Russia is a realist state. It isn't under any illusion that it could reclaim superpower status. What it seeks to do instead is break down U.S. superpower status and return global order to a more equitable distribution of power and influence. That means to restore its regional supremacy, to establish an international coalition of actors willing to challenge both U.S. soft power and hard power (if necessary) and try to turn U.S. allies into more neutral states by demonstrating that Russia and its political bloc is a viable political alternative to the U.S. ",393

"I live in Hong Kong.

**Why is this kidnapping significant?**

Because Hong Kong's system of laws guarantees freedom of speech. By kidnapping a bookseller in Hong Kong, Hong Kong's system of laws to protect speech and people mean nothing.

Kidnappings are regular in any other mainland Chinese cities, but not in Hong Kong. Mainland Chinese laws on censorship are not supposed to be enforced in Hong Kong under the [One Country, Two Systems principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems) and mainland Chinese police are not supposed to operate in Hong Kong. 

If Lee Bo was truly kidnapped by mainland Chinese security forces in Hong Kong, then anyone in Hong Kong can be kidnapped for speaking out. And since I've told you where I live, then I'll ask what can happen to me?

**Why is the bookseller Lee Bo strongly suspected to have been kidnapped?**

Because he left his Home Return Permit (a document that one needs to pass immigration border to enter mainland China) at home. However, faxes and videos allegedly received have Lee Bo 'saying' he went to mainland China on his own personal choice and not to cause a fuss/make trouble/protest about his situation in Hong Kong.

"It IS done in purpose.

Those who benefit from mass immigration are 

1) the richest industrial sectors and those sectors that directly deal with the influx in some way
2) the governments 


The richest get cheap labor. When you have an abundance of possible workers available for pennies, you can lower wages as you prefer. That leads to a gradual weakening of worker's rights.

At the same time, governments get to gradually eschew welfare because 1) too many people on welfare  and 2) the majority, who are natives, won't fight to keep welfare laws up when they - correctly or not - feel like the only ones who are benefiting from them are workshy migrants. More migrants -&gt; more welfare expenditure -&gt; until a breaking point where the government announces that ""cuts must be made"" and ""pension age must be higher. How about you all stop working at 70?"".

At the same time, governments get another bonus - that is, weakened social cohesion. If you don't know and don't trust your Pakistani neighbor you're not going to take to the streets with the aforementioned  neighbor and protest for anything at all. This is closely tied to the point above about welfare.

Also, governments get another bonus, which is a neverending circle jerk on immigration that is useful at election time: the right exploits it to get people angry, the left exploits it to feel morally superior and humanitarian. This polarizes the debate and gets people voting. Furthermore, gov'ments get a built in scapegoat for anything that is going less than ideally in the country - lack of jobs, stagnating economy,small criminality, housing shortages,, etc., anything that should be resolved by a capable government suddenly has one single extremely convenient cause, that is, migrants. Double bonus. That's how you get governments that publicly denounce immigration as a crisis but don't do anything serious about it. They don't because they don't want to. They're playing both sides, the Right and the Left.

Eventually  the average Joe and Joanne get shafted, with less rights, more competition, less welfare than pre mass migration and worsened social conditions. They get to deal with unsafe neighborhoods and working until old age, while the rich and the powerful profit and holiday in Monaco. 

TL; DR: only people benefitting from immigration are the rich and the governments.",391

"People need to understand that critisizing Islamism is akin to critisizing another ideological idea like Nazism. It fundamentally contains doctrines that could be interpreted strictly into violent actions. The very fact that critisizing Islamism generates such counterintuitive reactions from politicians is because chaos often ensued (including killing and rioting) when this ideology is criticized. Islam means submission and is not a religion (and political idea) of peace period, thinking that is just being intellectually dishonest and dellusional. ""Why are the majority of Muslims moderate and peaceful then?"" you might ask. The reason is because one is automatically born muslim if one's parents are muslims, threat of death or harsh punishment for apostasy, and the inability (and even forbidden) of regular muslims to interpret the Quran/Haddith on their own without the interpretations and teachings of the Imaam. These factors lead to a phenomenon known as moderation, where muslims are ignorant of these violent fundamentalist ideas and continue with their peaceful lives. We need to put aside our radical political correctness glasses which is currently clouding our judgement and criticism and discuss honestly with the moderate Muslims on not denying the violent nature of Islamism and reforming the faith.",228

"Distance and light. Usually we find exoplanets via two methods:

1. Observing the 'wobble' of a distance star. Enough, predictable wobbling can indicate gravity from orbiting bodies having an effect on the star. 

2. Light, or rather, a lack of. We basically stare at the star (of which candidates are usually chosen via the previous method) and look for the light dimming which would occur when a large enough object passes between the star &amp; us (which is also why most the exoplanets we found before our telescopes, data processing and 'wobbling' techniques improved were large gas giants).


On the other hand, neither of those techniques are possible for planets orbiting the sun further than us as we're not going to see them pass between us &amp; it (at least, we hope we don't). Likewise we're too close to the sun (and the planets too far) to observe the wobbling effect. However, in order to detect this planet they 'have' used a technique involving gravity, but instead of a star they looked at the orbits of other objects such as comets (it's been suspected for a while that there may be another planet due to the orbits of Neptune &amp; Uranus).

A small excerpt:

&gt;The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, ""in the middle of nowhere."" In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows.

[...]

&gt;The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: ""Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?""

[...]

&gt;Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, ""Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked.""

[...]

&gt;All of the men started fighting. Several other Zeta members, who were still on a bus with other passengers, ordered the women whom they considered the most beautiful to descend the vehicle so they could rape them. Then they took away the children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the bus passengers. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten, while one heard the screams of the women and of the kids being put in acid.

[...]

&gt;A driver of one of the buses was then asked to turn on the bus engine, and then ordered to move the bus to where the kidnapped victims were handcuffed and laid down on the dirt floor. ""Drive on top of them,"" one of the killers told the bus driver, who stood there motionless. ""Drive on top of them or I will put you there too, asshole,"" ",1058

"Possibly but it depends how strict the government is. In Communist Albania, beards were banned to curb religious influence from Islam as well as Orthodox Christianity. During Lent and Ramadan, food was brought in to schools and factories and people who refused to eat were denounced.

Also, any city with a religious name was changed as well as personal names. People were forbidden from naming their children anything religious based and had to pick names from a pre-approved list of secular names. Additionally, state based atheist education was the norm.

This led to most Albanians today either considering themselves atheists, or believing that religion plays no part in their lives. Interfaith marriages are common and people consider their nationality to be more important than their faith.",128

"I remember watching a documentary about the UK immigration agency.

Immigration enforcement agents had been watching the premises of a Bangladeshi restaurant for months. Apparently the restaurant had been employing illegal immigrants. This operation had probably cost the tax-payer millions and was planned like the best of military operations. 

On the day of the operation the officers raided the restaurant mob-handed and rounded up all of the illegal migrants that were inside. When they were processed each migrant claimed to have no ID papers or passport.

 The response went something like this. 'Damn you pesky illegal immigrants! You cheeky fellas have outwitted us once again! We'll just have to let you go. Would you be so kind as to report to the nearest police station when you have found your documents? Cheerio'. At the end of the program it was announced that all of the migrants had disappeared without trace. Fancy?

Think of the catcalling video-it was two semi-trucks meeting at the intersection of race/class and gender.  If you watch the video, it is overwhelmingly poor black men doing the cat calling.  Once that was called out (by both sides of the gender warriors, for different reasons, mind you), the maker had to squirm around and basically make up excuses (""Oh, they weren't heard as well, so we cut them out""...oh really 10 hours of shooting and somehow all the white men weren't heard...yeah, ok).

Well, the same is starting to happen with feminism's narrative about victim blaming and being tolerant of other cultures and practices.  For those that have been blind, the Middle East isn't exactly known for their tolerant, progressive views concerning women's roles in society. Their general treatment of women is frankly shit.  It is reflected both in their laws and their personal religious beliefs.  People, including me, have no problem calling out conservative Christians for their horseshit, regressive views on gay marriage only because conservatives are a large demographic in the US.  Are we to wait until there are enough Muslims in the West in order to criticize their medieval, regressive views and religious dogmas?      

So at some point, these ""tolerant liberals"" are going to have to join more of those regressive western conservatives in denouncing behaviors of people from Middle Eastern countries.

"I remember going to do the whole Asian backpacking rite when I was in my early twenties. I went along with my then girlfriend. She wore flight comfy clothes, so above knee shorts and a vest, trainers with a hoodie. We stopped at Abu Dhabi as a transfer for five hours, before flying to Bangkok. During the wait, she fell asleep head on my lap with her legs laid out on the seating. I then looked around, and there were men literally gawping at her, with some even having a rub of their genitals at the same time. I in return eyeball screwed the fuck out of them with my game face, and the return looks were like 'what?' like they could not see what was wrong. Next some of these fuckers tried sitting on the end of the seat so they could get a closer look. I was a naive twenty year old, so I would tell them 'get fuck outta here', which alarmed them. Looking back I was lucky they were not locals (Emirates), or I am sure they would have took me off for questioning. ",201

Anti-immigration views get barraged by constant shaming. it doesn't help that there are a quite a few stupid people who'd simply let them die or something. 

Both sides have stupids and none tries to come up with a good solution. anti-immigration tends to get a wee bit too radical (can't express their thoughts, views in a more complex manner and/or feel threatened), pro has no long-term strategy and is actively covering its eyes and dissing the fuck out of anti (simple people on this side as well). 

As usual, the not-extreme countrymen are stuck in the middle and just want to do something that'd actually help. putting up a fence and saying this is OK is just wtf. this crisis is FAR from over and it's not being handled.

IDK, at least in my country we cant even seem to be able to start talking and actually doing something constructive about the situation. we just do what we do best - hate on each other since 1945 and not do anything about the corrupt and incompetent government. if you're a politician, it's good to have the people divided. our political discussion always boil down to YOU'RE A FILTHY COMMIE OPPRESSING US SINCE 1945, POST WAR MASS KILLINGS, GOLI OTOK, TITO OPPRESSIVE DICTATOR RABBLE RABBLE  vs. YOU'RE A FUCKING COLLABORATOR, TITO SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU ALL RABBLE RABBLE.

On the way back to France, i was sent into the room to give him a bottle of water and sandwich. As soon as i opened the door he ran at me with something in his hands.

Education is key to solving this problem. Throwing welfare benefits at refugees isn't going to solve shit. First, language barriers, second, rights and laws, third, culture and basic education for those who need it. The government must take responsibility for integrating refugees, otherwise more attacks like these are going to happen.

One of the problems with comparing tax rates is that businesses often face two layers of taxation. First, they pay taxes as they earn a profit. Then, these profits are taxed when they are paid out to shareholders as dividends. 

Another problem is that there are taxes besides income tax. In Europe, Value Added Taxes are quite common, and constitute a significant expense. In the United States, state and local income taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes can also be a significant expense to consider.

It's important to see the whole picture before we say whether a company truly faces an unfairly high or unfairly low tax burden.

"The rule sounds more like employers will need to pay non-EU migrants at least £35,000 if they want to employ them along with a 1000 quid levy, apparently in an effort to discourage employers from using cheap foreign labor to depress wages.

Visas for overseas workers are supposed to be issued on the basis that the domestic labor pool is so tight that no domestic workers can be found, this is the government trying to make sure companies need a visa because there ""aren't qualified applicants"" rather than ""there aren't qualified applicants willing to work for low wages"". Basically if a company claims they can't fill a position with a British or EU national they need to keep raising the salary on offer until they either attract applicants from within the EU or reach 35k and can then look overseas.

IMO this isn't necessarily a bad thing for foreign workers - their visas are typically tied to their employer, leaving them very few options to change jobs and giving their employers a huge amount of leverage during salary negotiations. The law could potentially make sure that they're at least coming in on a decent wage to start with.",158

"&gt; But why is integration 'not going to happen' in this case?

Maybe it's just me being a little pessimistic. But honestly I think the biggest problems are the following:

1)The main reaction I'm seeing with these events is ""wtf, we welcome these people in and this is how they repay us."" This ignores the basic problems... 

2)Particularly pertaining to Europe, I think there is simply a question of the number of migrants being too high in relation to the population, geographical size, and money.  I think in the US in particular, it would be possible to take in quite a few refugees more as long as they were distributed around the country. The population size and land mass allows that. 

3)For integration to happen, you actually have to integrate them into society. Putting them in refugee centers which basically amounts to zones where they remain in their cultural norms and then having these zones exist in the middle of western cities is a recipe of disaster.

Basically having a handful of refugees dropped into western society leads to an amusing sitcom about cultures clashing, having a mass of refugees leads to Koln on NYE...",123

"These incidents says about as much about the UN generally as Abu Ghraib did about the US generally: not much.

These rapists are scumbags.  But let's understand who they are.  Couple of key things that it's important to recognise:

* These are mostly not UN personnel.  They are members of the armed forces of countries that send their troops to do UN peacekeeping duties.
* These are combat soldiers, deployed to current or recent warzones.

There's a really, really important lesson to be learned here, and it's not that the UN is somehow more predisposed to rape than any other international force.  The lesson is that sending in the troops doesn't make it all okay.  Deploying troops brings its own problems.  There's a reason that most militaries have their own military police force: there are just as many scumbag rapist in the military as in the general population.

So next time you hear ""UN peacekeeper"" think ""18 year old high school dropout from a third world country who thought he'd be fighting in a war, not patrolling a refugee camp"".

Of course it's not all bad, there are lots of great guys in the military, there are lots of UN peacekeeping missions that have been successful.

But we still can't tell what portion of those ""children"" are also men, and keep in mind that includes late teenagers. Quite possibly, the children demographic is even higher of a male:female ratio because of teenaged boys.

Good portion of these refugees are just opportunist and cowards abandoning the women of their families and communities. Then others get surprised that the demographic might have a notable tendency to treat native women with similar contempt as they regarded their own.

If we are to learn any real lesson from WWII and it's aftermath, it's that cultural relativism is a moral philosophy that belongs in the garbage can and that forcing assimilation into western morality like we did for Germany and Japan is best for everyone.

"Hi,

So although it does seem impossible to dehydrate whilst surrounded by snow, it's actually a high risk.

Being in such a cold climate means maintaining core body temperature is very important. That means you can't just scoop up some snow, munch it down until it's partially melted and then expect to be rehydrated. This would serve to rehydrate for a very short amount of time, as the loss of core body temperature and energy expended to just 'eat' it would soon need making up. As well as this, the snow has been likely laying dormant for an extended period of time, so there's a risk of pollutants, bacteria, general 'you don't want to consume that' stuff.

An efficient way of getting water would be to use a stove or some source of heat to melt the snow, potentially boil it, without expending the important energy and temperature of the body.

&gt; A. He’s entitled to defend himself to the world, but not to me.

&gt; Q. Okay.

&gt; A. He’s not entitled to an audience from me, Mr. Murphy.

&gt; Q. Okay. And that’s what it comes down to, would you agree with me, that you don’t believe that Mr. Elliott is entitled to defend himself to you?

&gt; A. To me. Yeah ... no, I don’t believe he is.

&gt; Q. Right. Okay. No matter what you say to or about Mr. Elliott, agreed?

&gt; A. There were a lot of people who backed me up on what I said about him,  a lot of people, Mr. Murphy.

&gt; Q. Two of whom are ...

&gt; A. Two of the dozens, yeah.

&gt; Q. Two of whom are the complainants in this case, right?

&gt; A. Yes. Yes.4

Or handing over ""evidence"" that Elliot was a pedophile.

&gt; Q. But by the time you met Detective Bangild, you already testified to this, you were aware that she was either 18 or 19, agree?

&gt; A. Yes.

&gt; Q. Right. Good. So not really trying to help out Mr. Elliott when you’re not mentioning the fact it’s actually an adult, right?

&gt; A. My position wasn’t really that I wanted ... I was not trying to help Mr.  Elliott.

&gt; Q. Right.

&gt; A. He was stalking me. So no, I wasn’t trying to help me. I wasn’t trying  to harm him unduly, but I was not trying to help him and I was not trying to ... yeah.

&gt; Q. Right. In your view handing tweets alleging Mr. Elliott’s a pedophile without correcting the officers receiving them, is not trying  to harm Mr. Elliott, right?

"The whole argument that it's just a small % of feminists, doesn't even hold weight anymore. That might be true, but these extremist vocal minority are the loudest and most powerful (the way they attack others), and it's starting to make everything miserable.

Also being a woman, I've often been given the cold shoulder by other feminists, for not identifying as feminist. Even the more sane/rational feminists, still hold a mentality that all women should be feminists, and subscribe to the same ideas. If you don't, you are on the outs. I've also seen normal feminists, scoff at male issues. They will admit that male's have issues, but say that since men have inherent privilege, they should suck it up and deal with feminist issues first.

I just can't get behind that. I'm at a point where I honestly think we need a movement that directly benefits both genders. A movement that addresses both genders equally. I just think we are at a point where movements dedicated solely to a gender, no longer makes any sense. I also think a lot of gender issues are intertwined, and require both genders working together to solve it. And I think the current movement where it's mostly focused on one gender, makes it harder to achieve those goals.

Just my feelings. Also, while I know there are things I have to face as a woman that put me at a disadvantage, I also see men all the time facing unfair shit because of their gender. The difference is, there is almost no sympathy for males. Whereas even liberal males, will come to the defense of women issues, but they won't bat an eye at male issues. And again, it's the ""suck it up"" attitude. 

When I was in college, 100% of my classes were 30 women to 10 men. It wasn't just my local community college, when I went to a major university I saw the same thing. When I went to school as a child, I remember teachers and the school system specifically pushing and encouraging women to do higher education. The same support was not there for male students. I think it's great that we push for equality (since in the past, there was an imbalance in genders in college), but I feel like we have gone too far the other direction, and made things less equal. 

It's like, we see a problem. We want to fix it. Then we go too extreme, and then when it leaves the other side on the short end, we tell them to suck it up. And what about all the males born in the last 20 years? The ones that were raised to not be sexist. These people are getting the short end of the stick on a lot of things, and I see it turning them bitter. It's really no surprise to me at all, that I see so many men angry. Honestly, if I was a male, I would be pretty pissed too. I actually feel sorry for a lot of males.

They were right.** The ivory bought by the Chinese government is drip-fed onto the domestic market at a rate of five tonnes a year. That comes nowhere close to meeting demand, estimated at 200 tonnes a year. And the sales have coincided with an explosive increase in poaching.

"[Palestinians are already](http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2016/01/sure-as-rain-gazans-accuse-israel-of.html) blaming flooding on Israel, claiming it opened dams to flood Gaza.

Israel has no dams near Gaza to open. The dams don't exist. This myth comes up every year. Last year AFP and Al Jazeera even repeated it, and had to retract the articles. But sure as rain, Palestinians are doing it again. No doubt this tunnel collapse will be blamed on Israel's ""opening of the dams"" too.

This kind of anti-Israel propaganda about the dams is precisely why peace is impossible right now. Palestinians are brainwashed with this crap all their lives. Israel says openly it isn't going to change the Temple Mount status quo, but all Palestinians hear is that it is, and therefore 80%+ think Israel is gonna destroy Al Aqsa. Israel offered to place cameras there to prove it's only Palestinians rioting, and Palestinian leaders refused, because they want to be able to keep lying about Israel.

Enough is enough! Sweden isn’t what it once was and no one could have missed that by now, and practically every day we have to wake up to news about new murders, robberies, rapes and other crimes.

We’ve had to suffer through innumerable cases of serious crime where the criminals never even get punished by claiming that they’re below 15 years of age. Around the country we’re getting reports that the police can’t combat this wave of crime targeting the Swedish people.

In some cases as in the murder of a woman, working at a home for unaccompanied refugee children, in Mölndal, it all goes so far the the chief police officer shows greater sympathy for the murderer than the victim. That type of respectless behavior is nowadays so deeply rooted in our spineless politicians, our weak law enforcement and our lying media that nothing surprises us anymore.

But we refuse to accept the continued rapes and harassment targeting Swedish women. We refuse to accept the destruction of our once so safe society. When our political leaders and police show greater sympathy for murderers than their victims there’s no longer any excuses to let it all happen without protest.

When Swedish streets no longer are safe to walk for swedes it’s our duty to do something about it. Today, 200 Swedish men gathered to send a clear signal to these Moroccan “street children” that’s ravaging around the central station. The police have clearly shown that they lack the means to repress this phenomenon and we now see no other alternative than handing out the punishments they deserve ourselves. The law enforcement have left walk over and the social contract are therefore broken – that’s why it’s the duty of every Swedish man to defend our public spaces against the imported criminality.

We who gathered today are not your politician, your journalist or your police officer. We’re on the other hand your father, your brother, your husband, your friend and your neighbor. Swedish men and women deserve safety in their everyday life and therefore we encourage everyone who also sees the problems to follow in our footsteps, both in Stockholm and in other places across the country.

[9] How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against the rock.



Also note that it is a song of lament, not any sort of holy instruction to go out and do such.

"If you look at a star and planets are orbiting it at the right angle, they will pass by the star in front of our view. This makes it relatively easy to know where to look harder to find a planet orbiting a faraway star.

If you're looking for a planet in our solar system, you're basically searching the whole night sky for the light of our sun reflected off of that planet, because the other alternative is basically to watch every star in the sky to see if a line of them get covered by the orbital path of the planet, which is ridiculous.

The former (planets in other solar systems) seems much easier than the latter for a planet so far out and thus so dark. But I know very little about astronomy. This is all just logical process based on tidbits of knowledge.

Edit: I should also add, I'm pretty sure they also use mathematical modelling to hypothesize the existence of planets - basically how gravity affects the orbit of celestial bodies and the path of light. So I assume they do up a model of gravitational forces and realize it only makes sense if there's a big mass in a certain area, which is probably a planet.

The ideology of the ruling-class becomes the ruling-ideology. 

Like Albert Einstein wrote in [Why Socialism?](http://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/)

&gt;Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

It is referred to as [the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois_democracy#Dictatorship_of_the_bourgeoisie) or the dictatorship of private capital.

Stop thinking in black and white, this isn't a fkin game you can win or lose, this is real life.

It makes me mad thinking that innocent immigrants that just wanted to live in peace are being beat up by vigilantes that just don't care anymore.

But if shit like that wouldn't happen, then the police would've never been invented in the first place, no need for the police if every crime is solved and punished completely fair by the people themselves.

Peace is not the status quo.

If the police fails, as they did, then vigilantes like these are the consequence, no matter if it's wrong or right.

You just pull the string on one side and it changes the outcome, but the mechanisms are always the same.

If you want vigilantism to go away as a government, you have to protect your people and most importantly fkin prosecute criminals.

We're handling this whole crisis so poorly it's becoming cartoonish. It's [WAY](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Diminishing_returns) more effective to create infrastructure in the first place, than to expand it ad hoc. Also, without improving the situation in poor countries, birth rates [will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE) negate any amount we can ever take in. It's just how geometric growth works, nothing surprising.
Also, it's much easier to integrate people in countries with similar cultures and economic levels. Employing [unskilled](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3wzxat/report_reveals_most_syrian_refugees_are/) manpower in post industrial societies, where even factory workers need the 12th year and extra formation is nigh impossible. In a similarly developed country to their own, not so much.
 
&amp;nbsp; 

I'll have to quote him here. 
&gt;""Stupidity is letting hundreds of thousands of people -- millions -- into Europe with no controls, while everyone, Europeans and migrants alike, can see they'll never get what they hoped for here,""

Once again, true. This clusterfrack is a like a postmodern trail of tears, with people dying in troves on the way to the promised land of milk and honey. It's disgusting to let it happen in the first place.
I'd be all for a screening in camps outside the eu, under an well established protocol and distribution system, to have quotas of people from these places come. That way we could still ease some of the burden, while filtering violent, extremist, or too [dissonant](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance) individuals and prioritizing endangered minorities like the [Yazidi](http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/24/women-escaped-slavery-isis-sinjar/)
On a more pragmatic note, and quoting from a [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3vwt04/ammunition_is_propaganda_found_after_france/cxrejsa) post, [this](http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/gborjas/publications/journal/JEL2015.pdf) is a great eye opener. It explains how income is bound to fall for the lower and middle class only to hugely increase for the upper class with massive influx of migrants (TL;DR think of it as the reverse of what happened in the black plague, too much manpower to employ). And being for policy that screws the poor in favour of the rich is a very right wing thing to do actually. So it surprises me that only strongly right wing parties stand against these policies.
 
&amp;nbsp; 

Also, there are many many other stupid things we do, we could be doing in a much better way, like creating fledgling economies in refugee camps by employing that unskilled manpower in added value jobs. We could do that by also sending them raw goods (grain instead of bread, cloth instead of clothes), which are way cheaper, easier to storage and take longer to spoil and employ them in processing that, which would not only help take away their minds from the awful situation they're in, but help give them a sense of meaning.

&amp;nbsp; 

In the end, yes. We are being VERY stupid in handling this crisis, and we could be doing way better. For both our and the sake of the true refugees, we, and the left in particular need to get out of the high horse of identity politics and act on the problems instead of burying their heads in the sand, or people with abhorrent ideas will just climb to power simply because they are talking about the issue and not skirting around, pretending that it rains.

&gt;But on the fateful night of January 22-23 in the wilderness of Manoharpur village in the sleepy rural outback of Orissa's Keonjhar district, nothing worked for the hapless father and his two sons. Having surrounded them from all sides, a murderous crowd set on fire the old four-wheel drive Willy's station wagon in which the three had retired for the night.

The murderous hindu gang's leader Dara Singh and his followers still evade proper justice. ",357

German source, sorry. 
Basically they apply our social benefits laws. If you want Hartz IV (unemployed for a longer time basically, you get around 400€) they expect you to use up your personal savings first. Same thing applies here. Refugees don't work in 99% of the cases, have no income and are state financed. So if they have a stash of money, random example 1000€, they require them to basically use up 800€ first, which in the real world means they take those 800€ that are more than the basic allowance and pay our running costs with it. 

Edit: for clarification: German unemployed citizens get more than just 400€, we pay housing, insurance etc. The 400€ is basically spending money for food and other goods.

Personal note: this might seem harsh, but if we require our own unemployed citizens to use up their own wealth, we can't use different rules for refugees.",286

&gt; Vulcan Inc. and Paul G. Allen have a long history of responsible exploration and a commitment to ocean conservation.  

&gt;On January 14, 2016, M/V Tatoosh was moored in a position explicitly directed by the local Port Authority. When its crew was alerted by a diver that her anchor chain may have impacted coral in the area, the crew promptly, and on their own accord, relocated their position to ensure the reef was protected. Vulcan and the ship’s crew are actively and cooperatively working with local authorities to determine the details of what happened. An investigation by local authorities is ongoing.

&gt;Through his longtime philanthropic and scientific endeavors, Paul G. Allen is a global leader in supporting ocean health. Last year, he announced support for cutting-edge research designed to stabilize and restore coral reefs.

"Keeping this ELI5:


**Pros:** Cheaper oil prices mean manufacturing becomes cheaper. So anything produced in factories or refineries becomes cheaper for the consumer to purchase. This includes virtually everything such as gas, chemicals, clothing, technology, vehicles, makeup, textiles, plastics, etc. However many large manufacturing firms purchase future contracts much like airlines do so it can take months to see any noticeable change in prices if you see any change at all. 

Transportation and logistics become cheaper. This has a stronger affect on things like airline or cruise tickets, food costs, and postal shipping prices. It can also have a slight affect on general consumer good prices (pennies not dollars). Finally os the most obvious which is energy prices (electricity, gasoline, and natural gas).


**Cons** The petroleum and chemical industries are both very dependent on oil prices. These industries are collectively among the largest employers in many countries including: the United States, Canada, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and many many more. When oil prices crash it can result in a dramatic spike in unemployment. This is particularly true in areas that have well developed oilfields. Another con is that it typically results in decreased spending and recession like effects. Most people think that just because gas is a few cents cheaper that they will have more money to spend elsewhere which means increased spending in the overall economy. This is only partially true. What these people fail to realize is that the hundreds of thousands to millions of roughnecks spent far more money and contributed more spending in the overall economy by far than what we see when oil prices crash and these people no longer have disposable (or any) income. 20 year olds aren't exactly known for their financial savvy. Give millions of these kids six figure incomes and they'll spend it like no tomorrow. This spending far outpaces the spending generated when the financially conscious / savvy are able to save a few cents on each gallon of their gas.

Another con is that it can make transportation industries much more competitive. If an airline is still buying gas based on futures they purchased from 4 months ago, they could face some serious issues trying to make a profit against a company buying gas at significantly cheaper prices we see in the current futures market. You see many of the oil support industries face financial troubles. This includes everything from food to tires to technology, to safety equipment, etc. Overall when energy prices fall we begin to see recession like effects in the overall economy (and definitely so in smaller micro economies like soecific states or providences). Spending slows down and people in general overall have less money.",729

&gt;Trump is a lot of things, but he is not hate speech. If you do not agree, please consider that the standard of hate speech is very different among different people. In particular, to politically-correct people, anything that disagrees with them is hate-speech. 

He literally said that most Mexicans are criminals. He made fun of a disabled reporter *on live fucking national television.*


&gt;To trump supporters, this is not an exaggeration. Political correctness has become a religion. And heresy towards PC de-facto becomes national tragedy and drama. The leftist side actively weaponizes this atmosphere of self-righteousness by playing the PC card at every opportunity that they can. Trump's statements were often crude, but when we heard them through the headlines of mass-media, you know that supposedly ""respected"" and unbiased news outlets were exaggerating and maligning these statements beyond reason. All for the crime of offending PC.

You seem to think that anything anyone who doesn't insult everyone who isn't white is ""PC"". That's not PC, it's just **not insulting people.** PC would be if you demanded everyone called illegal immigrants ""undocumented immigrants"" or called the mentally disabled ""differently abled"". Or to rephrase your earlier point, ""In particular, to Trump supporters, anything that disagrees with them is politically correct.""

&gt;To them, Trump is just a mildly crude version of saying the truth. And if you really examine what he says, it is all not that unreasonable.

So you want someone to be president of the United States, possibly the most important man in the world, even though he has no clue how to conduct diplomacy, only wants to help the rich, and will probably drag the US into a huge war with another superpower, simply because he's insulting everyone who isn't white?",119

"Good post, though I have to wonder why you didn't include sectarian violence perpetrated by non-Hindus as well. Sectarian violence in general is a problem in India. Hindus do it more because they are the majority group (and currently because of the Hindu Right's electoral victories), but as a community, they are not more likely to do it than any of the others. Indeed, sectarian and communal violence run deep in South Asia more generally, and are just as bad in places like Pakistan as in India. It's a tragic state of affairs.

Edit: No, I'm not going to explain to you why the cost of living in a country will increase when suddenly everybody has more money.

Edit 2: Seems like i really have to explain this....

For the middle class this simply means that they get a tax break of £1700. There is no money generated, but the average middle class person now has £1700 more to spend per month.

For the upper class this is actually meaningless because if only those people were there the cost of living would be much much higher anyway.

For the lower class this means free money. They probably didn't even pay that much taxes or none at all. So now they have at least £1700 per month to spent however they want.

So in any case everybody has £1700 more to spend. Call it ""tax break"" for the middle class, call it ""free money"" for the lower class, call it ""i've got more money than i can spend"" for the upper class, whatever you want. But in the end those £1700 raise the purchasing power for EVERYONE by exactly £1700. And that will (maybe not instantly) also raise the cost of living by that exact amount.

"Curious how many of these people are actually right-wingers, or left-wingers that are just like ""fuck Merkel""

Edit:

OP linked [this](http://www.focus.de/politik/videos/insa-umfrage-kanzlerin-in-bedraengnis-40-der-deutschen-wollen-merkels-ruecktritt_id_5248053.html) 

Based on that and the most recent poll numbers, here is the break down of that 40%, by party.

From most, to least:

SPD: 28%

CDU/CSU: 23.7%

AfD: 17.9%

Die Linke: 11.7%

Greens: 11.1%

FDP: 7.7%

Ideological make up of those who want Merkel to resign over *refugee policy*.

Left-wing Parties:
50.8%

Right wing Parties:
49.3%

All percentages rounded to the nearest tenth.



**So one of two things are happening here.**

1. Left-wing voters are becoming increasingly against refugees, but are sticking with their parties
2.  People are just reading ""want merkel to resign"" and are saying ""fuck please""



If people were truly swinging to the right-wing, you'd think right wing parties would make up a clear majority of those who want Merkel gone over refugee policies. That hasn't happened.

If one look at the polls, you'll realize that the CDU/CSU has dropped significantly during the refugee crisis, but Merkels core supporters are obviously steadfast.  SPD is stagnant and AfD is rising. Yet, if we assume that only CDU/CSU voters willing to go over to the AfD are those who want merkel to resign, things get interesting.

the AfD, unable to pull voters from the SPD, will only be able to grow at most 6-12 percentage points, including margins of error.

That'd bring them to 22% of the vote tops and the CDU\CSU 23% bottom. Meanwhile SPD would probably at at their current 25%

Now that'd create a clusterfuck.



Another Edit:

Yes, I know, left-right is not, normally, the most accurate way to compare parties.

However, the AfD, the primary beneficiary of those against current refugee policy, is both economically right-wing and socially right-wing. So they won't be swinging economically left voters well.

"The US government has often cited one of the prime motivations behind busting people who view images is that in doing so, you are re-victimizing those in the photos, as well as increasing the demand for child-abuse to occur. 

https://motherboard.vice.com/read/defense-lawyers-claim-fbi-peddled-child-porn-in-dark-web-sting?trk_source=recommended

Colin Fieman, one of the federal public defenders filing the motion to dismiss the indictment in this case says:

&gt; In their argument, Fieman and Sullivan point to the Department of Justice's own view on the harm caused by the proliferation of child pornography. “Once an image is on the Internet, it is irretrievable and can continue to circulate forever,” the Department of Justice website reads. In an April 2015 press release, US Attorney Josh J. Minkler said that “Producing and distributing child pornography re-victimizes our children every time it is passed from one person to another.”

&gt; In essence, the lawyers' point is that the FBI was, by running Playpen from its own servers, essentially distributing child pornography.

&gt; So, according to their argument, it is unclear how the “Government can possibly justify the massive distribution of child pornography that it accomplished in this case.” 

So, it's less about entrapment, and more about the states entire premise behind going after paedophiles in the first place. 

If someone is breaking the law by viewing an image - and that law is based upon the fact that by viewing it you are distributing it - and by distributing it you are increasing the demand for child abuse - then the Government (by definition of what they did), is also guilty of the same. Whether breaking the law to catch law breakers is a rock solid argument for drug busts is one thing, but when you're talking about distributing images of children being raped... I think the government has been playing a bit too fast and loose with how they've decided to handle these cases. 

I mean, they've literally been hosting thousands upon thousands of child rape images and videos for others to download and share for two weeks at a time. Even assuming they catch 1%&gt; of the total number of users on that site, tax pay dollars when to hosting the server and paying the bills in having those images online.

"I think part of the misunderstanding on this issue is that most of the these tax strategies are simultaneously legal and not legal - meaning attorneys/accountants have identified grey areas of the law/code that can be interpreted differently depending upon your situation.   

The process is usually as follows (as an example): Company X's consultants identify a tax strategy.  Company X takes an aggressive stance on the interpretation and pays $10M in taxes.  the IRS then takes a conservative stance claiming Company X misinterpreted the code and claims Company X owes $20M.  Eventually, through negotiations, Company X and IRS agree to settle on $15M.

These situations should not be analyzed by asking ""which party is technically correct?""  This is not how the process works for these tax strategies.  Only in very rare situations will Company X and the IRS litigate the tax issue to a court ruling on which party has the correct interpretation.  

And, frankly, both Company X and the IRS prefer it that way.  It's game theory - both parties would rather take 50% of something than gamble on 100% of nothing.

I think this idea is foreign to most people because typical individual tax filers tend to take credits/deductions that are well-litigated (very basic) and individual tax filers tend to be conservative due to the personal liability and possible jail time.  So they see others who take more aggressive stances on complicated tax matters as immoral because they do not do that for their individual tax filings.",355

It's not stated in the article, but China has no plans to accept any refugees themselves. The official party line is that they bear no responsibility for what happens in the middle east (even though they consume the 2nd most oil in the world). And they already have a massive population problem, and immigrants wouldn't be able to make a living. Which is probably true, but whatever.

"I once wrote a comment about exactly this happening in Sweden, there was little to no belief.

Months ago, a family friend who's a teacher in Sweden, far away from the capital (a good 600km journey or more) told about the way refugees abuse their situation. Not liking the food, special requests, and locals believing them. Just like Finns, Swedes are generally very nice people, so they didn't even understand it, they couldn't comprehend the fact that refugees could use their status. The only reason our friend saw it how it was, - because she's not Swedish. She's just happily married to one and developed a good understanding of what the local culture is like. Yet she's from a much more sceptical country and saw straight away that refugees are not all good and content to just have a place to stay, food and money allowances.

This is abuse of the host countries, plain and simple. If you're not willing to adapt, and go about stealing, raping and so - you shouldn't be allowed to stay.

I'm not all up for vigilante groups, but as you said yourself - police doesn't seem to have enough resources to deal with this crap.

It's way past the stage of just screwed up, and only gonna get worse as the refugees understand the limits of what they can get away with...",1113

"A man-made 5.1-magnitude earthquake was detected 49 kilometers (around 30 miles) from North Korea’s Punggye-ri nuclear test site on Jan. 6, indicating that Pyongyang likely carried out a fourth nuclear test, Bloomberg and Reuters reported. The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake took place at a depth of 10 kilometers. A nuclear bomb test in the same area and at a similar depth in 2013 triggered a 5.1-magnitude quake. The South Korean Meteorological Agency confirmed that the tremor was man-made, and Chinese earthquake monitors said it was caused by a suspected explosion. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry is holding an emergency meeting to discuss the possible test, according to Yonhap, while Japan’s top government spokesman said Tokyo has convened a meeting of a task force on North Korea. The country has conducted three previous nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, all at the Punggye-ri site. Recent satellite imagery suggested that the North has been digging a new tunnel at Punggye-ri of the type used for nuclear tests. The possible test comes shortly following news that the North successfully launched a ballistic missile test in late December, a month after an earlier test failed.",236

&gt;Since 1989 countries with elephant populations have twice been allowed to sell stockpiled ivory from elephants that died naturally under CITES, a global agreement on international trade in endangered species. **Before the second sale, in 2008, conservationists warned that it would revive the market in China, where ivory ornaments have long been prized, and make poaching profitable once more. They were right.** The ivory bought by the Chinese government is drip-fed onto the domestic market at a rate of five tonnes a year. That comes nowhere close to meeting demand, estimated at 200 tonnes a year. And the sales have coincided with an explosive increase in poaching.

However, they definitely don't like non-Japanese. They are of course overly polite, but underneath that is a easily detectable sense of loathing. None of this may surprise you, but here is the interesting part. They love Mexicans. Over the last five or so years I have watched all the local factories fill up with Mexicans. My neighborhood is almost all Mexicans, they are hard working family oriented people. This is why the Japanese like them so much. If you go into any of the Japanese owned factories these days it is almost exclusively Mexicans working inside. Far more then at other factories. At my last factory job, the opening shift instructions where each department gathers together for updates and whatnot was given exclusively in Spanish. I had to apply twice to get the job, and it was only after proving that I could understand enough Spanish to get by was I hired. There literally weren't enough white people to bother with saying things in both languages. This is in a smallish town in Indiana.

"Swiss resident here: 

Any Swiss citizen can force a nationwide vote for a popular initiative on any subject if they manage to collect ~~50,000+~~ (edit: 100,000+) valid, written signatures.

https://www.ch.ch/en/popular-initiatives/

(You could trigger a vote that every new child born in Switzerland must be named Donald Trump if you gathered enough signatures - **edit**: unless the initiative violates mandatory international law, such as torture - so that might rule this one out). 

Votes on referendums &amp; initiatives are then usually held up to 4 times per year covering all issues that meet the selection criteria. 

In recent years there have been a number of 'left-initiated' subjects, such as

*  salary capping at 1:12 ratio (voted 65% against)
*  abolition of compulsory military service (voted 73% against)
*  national minimum wage (set at 22 CHF / hour) (voted 76% against)
*  unified health insurance fund (voted 62% against)

In recent years, Switzerland has moved politically further to the right (especially with increasing concerns about immigration) - this country is rich &amp; stable. Swiss people are generally scared of anything that might screw this up. 

Just because an initiative - such as a basic income - gathers enough signatures to trigger a popular vote in Switzerland, it doesn't mean it will be passed (indeed the national minimum wage initiative was similar - and was heavily defeated). So far it is firmly opposed by the Swiss Federal Government:

I had two roommates at the time, both lifelong friends.  On one Friday night one roommate had his female co-worker(who was a little off to begin with) and her cousin come over to go out for a night of drinking.  The co-worker was always talking up her cousin as being gorgeous, which ended up being the opposite when we met her.  On the 10 point scale of human beauty, she was being sold as an 8, and lucky if she was a 4.

They started pre-partying in the living room, where she chugged her beer too fast and vomited on the floor.   They leave for what I presume is a night of drinking, and return sometime around 2am.  At this point in time they're loud as hell and my other roommate had the flu really bad, so I come out and tell my roommate they have to take a hike.  They all leave, roommate included, but turns out they clip a curb and blow a tire a mile down the road and walk back to the house.  My roommate crashes in his bed, and the two girls fall asleep on the couch in the living room together.

6am the next morning I hear the faint sound of the softly spoken words, ""I was raped last night.""  I immediately jump out of bed and open my door.  Said co-worker's cousin is standing in hallway whispering to my half asleep roommate that she was raped.

I'm freaking out that someone broke into our house and raped this poor girl.  I go to all the doors to ensure everything was properly locked against intruders.  Once I checked the locks and assured her no one could have come in, I realized she is not claiming that an intruder came in, but that myself or one of my roommates raped her.  My first reaction was to get angry and kick them both out, but I realized how fucking delicate the situation had become.

The rest of the morning was the weirdest thing.  We were pleading with her to try to remember to walk through the steps of the night in her head, possibly trying to exonerate us.  Explaining to both of them that neither was alone with any of us at anytime.   Their reaction was the weird part.  Both the girls were not frightened or scared to be in our presence, is was just a very polite matter of fact, ""one of you had to of raped me.""  The two girls were even giggling and telling secrets at one point.   Unfortunately, they both left still under the impression one of us raped them, but acted like is was no big deal.

"A number of reasons actually - some of them are cultural, some of them have to do with religion (caste and purity), some of its the force of habit and tradition, and the fact that existing toilets are really filthy, and some strange superstitions unique to India.

Here's a great TEDx talk on the topic of the relationship between caste and open defecation: 

http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/The-surprising-truth-of-open-de

Here's a slideshow on the subject she has up on the worldbank website: 

http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Event/Water/Needle%202015/Needle-2015-Day2-DeanSpears-Presentation.pdf

A quick summary is that in India the lowest of castes (also known as untouchables) are in charge of cleaning the ""night soil"". As the lower castes get more equality in society, they refuse to do what their ancestors were forced to do. As a result there's a big void. Upper caste people don't really want to make themselves impure by handling human waste. You can see similar attitudes with littering - Indian of upper castes consider it beneath them to clean up after themselves - a low caste sweeper is meant to do this.

So if a rural upper caste family makes a toilet, they try to build one where they will never have to touch human faeces. This requires a fucking gigantic latrine. Which of course is really expensive. That's why the UN mandated toilet systems just don't take off in India. And it's also a reason why many of the government's schemes to build UN mandated toilets are a total waste.

In rural areas this sort of thinking is much more dominant, so that's why 77% of them defecate out in the open.

Another excellent article from livemind: 

[Open defecation: busting a few myths: Instead of building latrines, policy should focus on behavioural change to raise the demand for sanitation](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/NtqjzL5DOg1nhExfqEm9zO/Open-defecation-busting-a-few-myths.html)

I live in Slovakia, I have never voted for this prime minister nor his party (and I never will), but you have to understand that this is not just the stance of the current ruling party. The opposition parties agree as well and most importantly, the population agrees. 

There was a local referendum last year in which 96.67% of the people voted against accepting these ""refugees"". This is not Crimea or anything similar, this is the very center of Europe, the referendum was completely transparent and almost 97% opposed this EU suicide attempt. Some of the Western countries (or rather, their leaders) keep accusing us of not upholding the ""European values"". Well, in my book, the idea of democracy is the most important European value. And referendums are the pinnacle of democracy.

What most of the Westerners fail to realize when they criticize V4 (Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary) is that WE are the ones who stood between the Islamic hordes and ""Western Europe"" for centuries. While the Western Europe was chilling in their cozy kingdoms, waging their pointless wars against each other, it was the V4 nations and the Balkan nations that kept the real threat away from Europe. And it took millions of lives and a couple of centuries of suffering. 

Still, if Western Europe wants to commit suicide, feel free to do so, we cannot stop you (although we find it a bit sad, after all, we consider ourselves a part of the European civilization too). Just don't force us to kill ourselves with you by things like enforced quotas and similar idiotic measures. We will not accept such things. We know better than that. ",520

"The Economist doesn't have an article up yet, but last time here is what they said:

http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/07/chinas-stockmarket-crash


&gt; CHINA is certainly not the first country to try to prop up a falling stockmarket. The central banks of America, Europe and Japan have all shown form in buying shares after crashes and cutting interest rates to cheer up bloodied investors. But the circumstances and the manner of China’s intervention of the past ten days make it an outlier, worryingly so.

&gt; The trigger in China’s case is perplexing. Yes, the stockmarket is down a third over the past month, but that has simply taken it back to March levels; it is still up 80% over the last year. Growth, though slowing, has stabilised recently. Other asset markets are performing well. Property, long in the doldrums, is turning up. Money-market rates are low and steady, suggesting calm in the banking sector. The anticipated correction of over-valued stocks hardly seems cause for much anguish.

&gt; Lost in all the drama about the stockmarket is that it still plays a surprisingly small role in China. The free-float value of Chinese markets—the amount available for trading—is just about a third of GDP, compared with more than 100% in developed economies. Less than 15% of household financial assets are invested in the stockmarket: which is why soaring shares did little to boost consumption and crashing prices will do little to hurt it. Many stocks were bought on debt, and the unwinding of these loans helps explain why the government has been unable to stop the rout. But this financing is not a systemic risk; it is just about 1.5% of total assets in the banking system.

&gt; **If economic stability is not in peril, why then the panic? The most compelling explanation is politics. The government has staked much credibility and prestige on the stockmarket.** When the going was still good, the official press was chock-a-block with articles about how the rally reflected the economic reforms that Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, was set to push. Li Keqiang, the premier, said repeatedly that he wanted equity markets to provide a bigger share of corporate financing—comments, from punters' perspective, not unlike waving a red cape in front of a bull. The sudden end to the rally is the first major dent in the public standing of the Xi-Li team. The botched attempts to stabilise the market only make them look weaker, giving succour to their critics.

I will never get over how good the Economist is at writing informative, accessible articles.

"I was there when it went up, about 12 miles away. Never saw a rocket go up in person before.

At first we saw a bright glow, like someone turned on a million old sodium lamps. You know, the ones they put in the streetlights that had that yellow orange glow. Anyway, it lit up the horizon for like ten seconds before it started climbing. As it went up the whole sky got brighter, almost like day but not quite.

What was really odd was the sound or lack there of. Since we were so far away it took a good 30 seconds before the sound wave hit. It was a gentle rumbling at first, that grew louder and louder, until the entire deck under us started to shake.

Finally the sound died down and the rocket climbed all the way up to near LEO, the light of it's fire dimming down to a tiny pin prick of light, darker than most stars followed by blackness.

Eventually the rocket separated, couldn't really make that part out, but after a moment you saw these two dim lights that spread apart. The one grew darker still, while the other grew brighter as it came closer to earth. It started to glow a dull reddish orange hue as it penetrated the atmosphere.

Then suddenly and without warning it lit up again. That same fireball from earlier that brightened the sky as the rocket slowed it's reentry. At first it puttered out before burning bright and long, making it's way to the alternate landing pad. 

A few seconds after it's engines fired again two loud booms could be heard around. These weren't like the sound of rockets firing or something exploding. No these were the sounds of the rocket breaking the sound barrier as rapidly made it's way back down to earth.

"I'm a Muslim living the US who has a little bit of background in the Islamic sciences. 

It's 100% absurd and completely outside of our religion for a Muslim to be offended by someone else eating pork. Anyone who's studied Islamic history knows full well that people of other faiths used to live in Muslim lands and raise pigs and eat...You guessed it! Pork!

I feel bad that any Danish store would stop selling pork just because some fools don't know their own religion and tradition. Our religion teaches us to try to bring benefit to the communities we live in, not to close up in our own bubble and demand everyone accommodate us. 

It's one thing to accommodate with halal options (which is awesome and we love anyone who does so &lt;3) but our religion didn't even in the slightest request that people of other faith change their eating habits for us.

What this article brings to the forefront for me is that Russia is on a path where relative to the west it may seem harsh and dictatorial at times but compared to its own recent history it is relatively progressive. I don't know for sure why Putin has such a high approval rating amongst his own people but I would suspect it has to do with the fact that to them, he is extremely fair compared to their past leadership. Further, I think the country's background requires a unique individual who can wield force in a way that keeps advocates of the old ways in line and keeps the country moving along its increasingly more progressive path. The big exception to this is the rejection of homosexuality which I do not feel fits in with the rest of the narrative.

Also, given how the current gov. of Saudi is selling its oil at a deficet, just to fight American and world-wide production - it would be very much in an Oil company's interest to get Saudi off the market so as to allow worldwide production to resume - it is currently halted because Saudi is literally flooding the market with dirt cheap oil.

Also, you're forgetting about the countries that would love America to be a customer.

&gt;Saudi Arabia, for all that they are, have been loyal allies to the United States. They were willing to risk being conquered by Saddam's Iraqi to remain our allies, even as we maintained our support for the state of Israel through the decades.

The bullshit is strong with this one. They didn't risk being conquered - they were under threat from Saddam, and they came crying to Uncle Sam for help. You make them seem like they were the heroic victors - they're the one who needed help. 

Also, they haven't been all that loyal. They take many extremists that come back into the country and place them in 'rehabilitation' centers - which are basically just cushy hostels. And almost everyone that goes into these places get out and are can very easily go back to fighting.

Furthermore, a lot of Wahabbi religious scholars within Saudi - which are the same religious scholars which are followed by ISIS - are very Anti-American. These are the same people protected, promoted, and payed for by Saudi. These are the same scholars that inspire these jihadists and religious divisions in the first place. These preachers are the bed-stone of extremism across the Sunni world, and Saudi pays for that thought to be taught across the world. So again - how loyal is Saudi?

&gt;There is a very dangerous radical islamist group rampaging their way through the neighborhood -- ISIS. If Saudi Arabia and Iran go to war, it's ISIS who will come out on top. They'll find new recruits, easily acquired Western weapons, and a government with like-minded religious ideals desperate for help.

They'll find new recruits - but not because of the war, but because Saudi citizens - particularly the fairly highly educated and unemployed youth in Saudi have always been taught the Wahabbi agenda, and the only thing that has widened or slimmed the funneling of them into ISIS is the Saudi government. At the start of the Syrian civil war, the government didn't make a sound about hundreds of its youth going out to fight - and made a fuss about it after they were coming back and killing its own service men. Saudi always had these recruits, they just have been unemployed and payed off to stay at home and shut up. 

&gt;It is only through their prolonged contact with the west that liberalism is starting to break the chokehold of authoritarianism in Saudi Arabia. Drop that contact now, send Saudi Arabia to the wolves and it'll be a disaster for those movements.

This is laughable. Saudi came into my country to crush democratic reform - and likewise in Yemen, and Egypt. Anywhere there is democratic reform happening, Saudi is willing to foot the bill to stop it. If anything, it was prolonged contacted with the west that has cemented the choke-hold of Saudi on the regions progression for liberalism and democracy. Drop the contact now, and you'll see the rest of the authoritarian regimes in the region collapse - this I absolutely guarantee with my life on it.

&gt;Saudi Arabia has a LOT of money. You might be terribly surprised how long that can draw out a war, leading to decreased stabilization of all the Gulf States.

Alot of people assume that these gulf states are all that stable. They're not. Its usually one family - or in the case of the UAE, multiple families - that run the show at their own discretion. When one member of these family dies, there is a wave of instability as the shuffling of members from lower ranks to higher ranks occurs - these aren't stable countries by any means. And a much more democratic and stable government is very likely given how educated the populace in all the countries have become. 

&gt;Iran, for all else that they are, are the regional power. Their military could roll through downtown Baghdad and there'd be little Iraq could throw their way to stop them. The Iranians drill and train a professional military, which still has many veterans from the Iran-Iraqi war. They'll punch a hole through Saudi defenses like a bazooka through a cardboard box.

I whole-heatedly agree with this. If and when Iran-Saudi war broke out, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will determine whether to fight it out as a coalition or just let Saudi eat the shit. I can tell you for a fact that the United Arab Emirates are def. going to want some of the action and maybe even Qatar and Bahrain. However, it will primarily end up being a Saudi-Iran war with Saudi wanting the US to stop the war. 

Saudi is very reliant on the US for protecting Saudi - even from Al-Qaeda in the region. Saudi can't even protect itself from rebels in Yemen, who are not even a quarter of equipped as the Saudi Army, however, they were able to go into Saudi and even take over a Saudi held town. Saudi's military is a joke - the only thing they have is fancy machinery that almost all of them have very little knowledge or experience to use.

&gt;We don't get to sit this one out. Even if we disregard the international obligations to respond, many would feel compelled at the humanitarian situation when a nation whose population is far over what they can naturally support starts to suffer serious war damages. Even if we do sit it out, let them go full Balkan states, when we come back after the war we'll have to rebuild their nation. Why? Because if we don't, China will.

You do get to sit this one out and just let the region progress. Stay out of our region and let us progress the natural way instead of holding these families above our head and making us deal with their shit. Fuck this train of thought. The only reason there is Anti-Western sentiment in the region is because of shit thoughts like this.

Also, we don't need you to rebuild our nations. The only reason we have the modern states we have now is because of oil money. Trust me, the only thing you'll need to do is fuck off and let us settle this ourselves. If after that we see China or Russia as suitable allys, we'll act accordingly. But why the fuck will we choose the US if this is the government that you supported for years on end at the price of the citizens of these nations.

"From the article:

&gt; While income and wealth are not the same thing, the wealthiest one per cent typically earn at least **£35,000**.

Wow, I didn't realize how little one had to make in order to be considered among the wealthiest 1% in the world. I would imagine that many users across Reddit talking about how evil and selfish the 1%ers of the world are would hardly realize that they themselves are among them. 

Edit: Just to clarify, I am no rich fat-cat rich boy by any means, but I think it is important that more Redditors here all take greater note of our affluent position in the spectrum of society, and recognize what we can do in this place to help those around the world. Also, while it is certainly a pasttime of Reddit to ridicule and deride any above us in more wealthy and affluent stations, remember that from a different perspective, we are those same people we deride. Our goal should be bringing all out of poverty, not just decrying those who are successful. It is the success of those above us that greatly aids in bringing greater wealth to the entire world. The power of capitalism in this age has brought more people out of poverty and lifted more to levels of success than any century in the history of this world. Capitalism is what is driving China, for instance, to heights of untold success and prosperity; its not Communism or socialism that is creating it (*and for clarity, I am NOT saying China is a perfect country*). So, while I certainly don't disagree that there is malfeasance and corruption at some levels of the corporate elite (as there are in many bureaucracies and power structures, which should be investigated), let us not forget what it was that built and innovated this modern world (and what continues to) and what has given us everything we have, that has freed us from the fields ans made our lives so enjoyable and convenient. Saying that capitalism is evil because there are still poor people is just about as useful as saying that farming is evil because there are still hungry people. 

Nothing is free. Glory can only be had through tribulation . We have responsibilities in this position of affluence we hold in the world, responsibility to give back for what we have gotten, to be good citizens to our countries and to be productive members of society and of the world.

Immigration is very low over there. It's something like 99% native Japanese. Their culture has high standards for what is and what isn't a dick move compared to here. If the immigration floodgates opened, people from different cultures will ruin it. Even in the UK, if you get something stolen because you left it unguarded, the response seems to be that you were the idiot, and what did you expect? It's a given that an unlocked bike will be gone within a few hours. It's a given that if you leave your laptop or phone at a McDonalds table while you go to the toilet, it will be taken, and it will be taken by a native that feels no guilt because it was ""your fault"" for leaving it there.

So with all the shit kicking off in Europe, just image how the average poor person from your country would cope in somewhere like Japan, when they bring along their own cultural norms and baggage.

What actually happened was that 250 far-right extremists organized to attack the Connewitz district in Leipzig *at the same time* that a PEGIDA rally was going on in Leipzig downtown. The PEGIDA rally was to commemorate the first year anniversary of the first public rally of the right-wing anti-immigration movement.

Connewitz is a neighborhood known for its concentration of left-wing people and organizations, hence the attack. The attack in Connewitz included destruction of shops, cars, public property, etc. and had nothing to do with what was going in the rally (except that it happened at the same time, probably because a lot of the anti-pegida people who would otherwise be in Connewitz were at the rally opposing it, therefore the district was more vulnerable).

"Most of what you just said is actually untrue, and your understanding of world system's theory seems only vaguely correct. That there need to be countries that ""take the hit"" is simply false, and doesn't make any macroeconomic sense. That countries develop at different rates is obviously true, but the path to national economic development is not fully understood. It's complicated, but a simplified explanation would be to say that we know that there is a four-step process, whereby:

1. A country increases its population and thus increases its chances of technological innovation.

2. More technological innovation leads to an increase in educational demand.

3. Increase in educational demand leads to more educated population.

4. More educated population will lead to further innovation, leading to a developed society.

There are certain Neo-Classical theories that suggest that, in a world (like ours) where information can be shared globally, all the nations of the world will exchange information and knowledge and none will have any sort of competitive advantage, and the world will develop at an equal pace. That's also obviously untrue. We don't really know why certain economies develop and others don't, although there are plenty of theories on the specifics, including the widely-criticized world system's theory. 

More pedantically, from a literary standpoint, I think you sort of missed the point of Objectivism. It doesn't have much of anything to do with what you're talking about.

Additionally, that you basically just seem to be ranting about us being ""cogs in the capitalist machines,"" I think that you're more of a pseudo-intellectual than an authority on the topic, and frankly just don't believe your below statement that you're getting a doctorate in Sociology.

Source: Am currently getting my PhD in Economics, and this is sort of my exact field of study.

Edit: Since you keep going on about the delusions of capitalism and won't stop PMing me to that effect... This isn't a defense of capitalism. This is the macroeconomic theory, which we KNOW to be true, about how a country goes from developing to developed. How to MAKE countries follow the theory is the single biggest open question in macroeconomics (and sociology, which... you *should* know). I believe that capitalism isn't a flawed system, but I'm not talking about capitalism. I'm talking about any economy implementing any political philosophy or system anywhere on the planet, at any point in the past 500 years.

Second (final) edit: I will no longer be responding to any replies on this comment. As I've said below, I'm not talking about ""high school economics.""

http://www.torontosun.com/2012/07/16/muslim-clerics-letter-to-the-sun-about-preventing-sex-assault

My Name is Al-Haashim Kamena Atangana and I have been reading in recent weeks sexual Assaults that have been occurring At York University. I just wanted to suggest a few changes within the Canadian laws that will help prevent sexual assaults from happening in the future.

Just to introduce myself I am a Muslim born in Montréal, Quebec 33 years ago. I was born in a Christian Family and I have decided to embrace Islam in 1998. I do allot of Islamic Outreach Programs downtown (yonge and Dundas).I am from African Carribean Ethnicity.

I wanted to mention that the reason why these sex attacks are continuously happening is because the Canadian laws, which gives too much freedom to women, are the cause of these sex attacks. It has been revealed that every 5 seconds a woman is being sexually assaulted in North America. Women in North America are falling victims of the Democratic Freedom that you they passionly believe in. The reason why a woman gets raped is because of the way she dress. Women dress so provocatively so much that they receive too much attention for themselves and that attention at times leads to death.

If the law enforcements and the Canadian politicians were very serious about solving this problem, they would introduce laws that would make it illegal for women to dress provocatively in the streets. It is true that many people would object to this if that were to happen. and this will definitely create protests and opposition. However by arresting sexual predators is not going to solve the problem because as long women continue to dress like this there will always be perverts and rapist who will continue to remain on the loose.

I am suggesting that Toronto becomes the first City in North America to introduce laws that would make it illegal for women to dress provocatively. If we do this the other cities would follow.

You should take your example from the way Muslim women dress. Why does Muslim women who wear long dress and covers her head aren’t targeted for sex attacks? Why is it that Rapists and sexual predators only target women that dress so provocatively? Because Muslim women have nothing to show in regards to her body.

But pointing this out may be considered racist as well because apparently non self control is the women's fault. Disgusting.

&gt;Expanding legal avenues for migration is the best way to control the flow of people, put smugglers out of business and prevent deaths. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has shown remarkable leadership on the refugee crisis, said in her New Year’s address, “Handled properly, today’s great task, presented by the influx and the integration of so many people, is an opportunity for tomorrow.” That is a New Year’s message all of Europe should heed.

Europe obviously heard a different New Year's message following Cologne's new year's eve.

* It is also a political posture by Europe that is by no stretch of imagination that hospitable to anyone, let alone alleged Muslims. It is posturing because every European country is fighting for a piece of the no longer forbidden but sizable fruit that is the Iranian market. Aka, this is PR, marketing, not really about politics

"I smoked pot heavily (wake and bake, lunch, after school. and night) throughout junior and senior year it high school. Recreationally for years after. Worked for a major biotech, got a PhD and went back for an MD years later. Based on a variety of test scores, I do very well on all measurable aspects of intelligence. 

Here's my secret: don't tell anyone you smoke pot. 

It was illegal and stigmatized. You'd have to be an idiot to let everyone know you commit a crime daily. The reason the pot smokers you know didn't do much in their life is that they are morons if they openly flaunt the law and society's rules. The pot is not the problem. Anecdotal data being bullshit is. 

This is also why almost all studies that look at pot use in adolescents is horribly flawed. All the smart kids lie and are counted as abstainers, leaving only the stupid kids who admit to some stranger that they break the law. Of course it makes it seem like pot hurts IQ. The study is flawed if it relies on self-reporting and almost all of them do. 

EDIT: Some people think that I am attempting to use an anecdotal experience to disprove another anecdotal experience. That is not the case, let me explain why. 

The study that the article references has disproven the anecdotal experience.  That conversation is over. The question I am addressing is why do people have this anecdotal experience that differs from what the paper has measured? 

The answer is that some research studies and peoples anecdotal experience both suffer from what is called a ""confounding factor"".  A confounding factor is a bias inherent in measurement that makes the measurement inaccurate. In this case, the confounding factor is the fact that more intelligent stoners tend to hide the fact that they smoke pot. I use my own experience as an example to illustrate the confounding factor. That is different from providing an anecdotal observations to challenge another anecdotal observations. I hope that clears things up.

Selected comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14d4ay/were_past_cultures_as_casually_accepting_of/c7chfb2

&gt; There are direct sources that claim the marriage was consumated at 9 or 10 in Hadith, but other hadith indirectly claim she was at least 13 or as old as 21 when she consummated with Mohammed.
The indirect sources include

&gt;1) an account that she was at a battle that other hadith say only 15 year olds were allowed to be at, making her at least 15 at that time, making the age at marraige 13

&gt;2) accounts of the age and death of her sister, who is stated to be 10 years older than Aisha died at an age and date that would make Aisha 21 at the age of marraige

&gt;3) accounts that say Aisha remembered her father trying to memorize part of the Quran that was just revealed, if she was 9 at the age of consummation, she would not have been born at the time of the revealation, and thus could not have remebered her father memorizing it when it was revealed.

&gt;Contrasting the indirect stories, there are many direct Hadith quotes claiming her age was 9 or 10. There are no hadith reporting directly that she was older than 10 at consummation, but all the hadith that claim Aisha was 9 or 10 has a ""chain of transmission"" that all bottleneck thru passes through one person. This person's reliability is directly called into question by a very big name in Islamic Theology, Iman Malik, on other issues. This calssical theologian specifically states in his description of Hadith transmitters not to make any rulings off any hadith that has that person in the chain and goes thru the ""people of Iraq."" This could be prejudice against Iraqis, or could be a indication of the untruthfulness of that person.

&gt;Regardless of all this, traditional Islamic scholars have taken the age of Aisha at face value from the direct hadith, though most say that the age of consent and marriage is culturally proscribed, not religiously proscribed. Most scholars make the onset of puberty the the minimum allowable age for marriage and/or consummation. 

&gt;But you are correct, even in ""Sharia Countries,"" the age of consent and the age of marriage does not allow for marriage to take place at 9 or 10.

do you also take into consideration that during that time and previous time before that such actions were normal?

&gt;1- The Bible's Prophets, and even Roman Emperors married girls as young as 8! *(nobles and nobility would usually marry/betroth their children as pacts or transactions between families)*

&gt;2- Mary got pregnant between the ages of 11 and 14. *(based on scripture hard to find evidence)*

&gt;3- Joseph was as old as 99 when he married Mary when she was in the age range above. *(based on scripture hard to find evidence, considering some people lived to be 300+ in the bible i will say the age range is hard to verify)*

&gt;4- The minimum age for marriage in the US-State of Delaware in year 1880 was 7 (seven). *(100% factual)*

&gt;5- According to the Jewish Talmud, Prophet Moses and his followers had sex with girls as young as 3 years old. 
*(hyperbolic and out of context. Although its literal translation; Yebhamot 11b: ""Sexual intercourse with a little girl is permitted if she is three years of age.""

&gt;Aboda Sarah 37a: ""A gentile girl who is three years old can be violated.

&gt;say such things, its now interpretation is that girls who were raped as young as 3 can still be considered virgins and be allowed to be married off by their fathers. Take that in whatever way you want."")*

&gt;You even have passages in the ~~bible~~ Talmud stating that after a battle you should kill all male children and keep all female children for you to use. 

ps: for those who will say ""so what if Christians or jews also did it"". Im not justifying it, im putting it into context.

___________________________
last edit i promise: just wanted to add a comment i wrote to someone.

&gt;not feeling like i am being attacked. But i will rebute with that islam isnt refusing reformation but pakistan in this case decided to allow marriage of 8 year olds.

&gt;NOW we can take that at face value and see that it is wrong.

&gt;OR we can see that it is wrong and yet still try to understand the context in which something like this can be passed.

&gt;Now considering the context the majority of Pakistanis rural areas are filled with poor people. The best way for poor people to ensure trade and possibly secure finance stability for their other family members is to betroth their daughters to men for marriage at a young age. NOW this doesn't mean that they would allow they 8 year old to be raped at that age, but that they would be bethrothed to be married to the person in exchange for some kind of gift/support/money as it usually works in poor countries. BUT it also doesnt exclude the fact that some men will take advantage of such contracts and abuse these girls and rape them.

&gt;But mostly considering islamic law, they usually dont have sexual intercourse until after menstruation which can be between 13-15 years old (still too young in my eyes)

&gt;But looking in the context of these issues, as well as taking into consideration that most poor families can barely survive and have to consider marrying off one child or feed the whole family, it doesn't become such a black and white issue as many believe. There are complexities involved that many do not take into consideration.

"Zuckerburg is smart. India is emblematic of the developing world in that it has more than a billion poor people who want to have smart phones and internet access but currently don't have anything. Phone makers are designing cheap, barely internet capable phones for this market and these people are slowly coming online.

But internet access costs money and most of these people are extremely poor so they may not be entirely sold on internet access. Zuck realizes they won't all be poor forever. So he launched a program called ""Internet Basics"" (it had another name before) that works with the cell companies to provide free internet access to these people, but only to Facebook (which is actually what most of these people want anyway) and its corporate partners. It's kind of a win-win, since people get some internet access and social connectivity at no cost, of course with the option of actually paying for full access if they decide they want and can afford it later on. Facebook gets a monopoly on the eyeballs and advertising to this huge group of future consumers.

But it runs afoul of net neutrality rules. People are up at arms saying this doesn't so much provide access to the internet as it does move internet access behind a paywall. Some are saying that allowing this program is handing over a monopoly on internet access to Zuckerburg and his company. Knowing that a great many people in India (and the developing countries) will stick with the free service by choice or by necessity of circumstance, Facebook becomes the gatekeeper to the information superhighway. So if Mapquest makes a deal with Facebook but Google Maps doesn't, all those consumers on the Internet Basics program will be using Mapquest to get around, even though for the rest of the world they are both free services that we can choose between. It makes anyone who wants to launch any kind of web or mobile service have to deal with Facebook, because they'll have all the customers. It sets a potentially dangerous precedent.

On the other hand, the poor people of the world currently have nothing, and if they can't or won't pay for full access, is it so bad to offer them something for free? Is it really such a Faustian bargain to offer *limited* access to people who have none at all? Why should the governing elite be telling the very poor that they shouldn't have the option of taking the limited, corporate-nannied service for free? Is it fair to tell the world's poorest citizens that their only choices are ""everything"" or ""nothing at all?""

If you are against this and think it's racist. FUCK YOU. You are a MORON who doesn't understand free speech. That being said, Canada is taking on 25,000 Syrian refugees. I agree with this plan. Why? Because we (after much arguing in parliament and the typical regressive left absurd, nonsensical ""racism"" charges) we've come up with a plan that EXCLUDES single Syrian men and only takes in families. Plus, we have finally (after the typical embarrassing idiocy from the regressive left) realized we need to take the proper amount of time to screen the refugees for safety purposes. 

  After the disgusting sex attacks in Cologne and elsewhere in Europe, I was GRATEFUL we weren't taking in single Syrian men. The program in Germany ignores this risk by taking in 70% single men?

Their entire mentality is on the level of a first grader, they are not interested in truth or rationality, all they care about is being ""right"". Just like a child simply cannot find it within themselves to admit that they were wrong or that someone else is right about *anything*, especially if they don't personally like that person, similarly this woman finds it absolutely *impossible* to admit that someone she personally dislikes is correct about something. Literally the mentality of a fucking child. Such people are impossible to reason with, i would say in fact that the entire concept of reason and logic does not exist within their minds. It is also possible that they will never change because they are no longer actually children. Children can be taught, they can be even be ""forced"" to change through the strict guidance of parents and other authority figures. She will not change, possibly for the rest of her life. Especially because as an adult she can scream and get aggressive like other adults, unlike a child other adults have no real influence over her. A lost cause.",831

"America is not blameless in this issue. One of the most unsustainable fisheries that exists is that of the Antarctic toothfish and America is the largest consumer market for this product - it is branded as Chilean Seabass to make it sound more appealing.

"Take away their market, legalize their product and sell it at a cheap rate so addicts stop funding them.

But that'll never happen because addiction is ""immoral.""

Edit:
Let me put it this way: the two big money makers for the cartels are Coke and heroin. If North American governments legalized those drugs and sold them at 80% of the price cartels did, as well as providing clean supplies for use and removing penalties for use like loss of employment, addicts would stop buying from the street and buy the legal stuff because it would be cheaper and, if it was uncut, much higher quality. The cartels would be dead in five years, because their main source of income is gone. Bam, problem solved, less violence, less organized crime, and fewer dead addicts. ",134

"**Im Slovakian myself and i live in capital town**. most of slovakians are nationalist, they ""love"" their country and culture and are hateful towards the government, fico is making decisions based on what people want to get re-elected his political party and be prime minister again. In capital town there is plenty of nationalist and protests against migrants and against government. Most of Slovakian are hateful towards Muslims and every different religion. I consider myself as liberal and I do not know where I stand on this issue to be honest. On one hand there is plenty of violence that was caused by Muslim groups and on other hand they are people that have no place to live? And were showing them hatred without trying to help. Our president has said that we must always help those in need but on other hand besides top 5 most populated towns, Slovakia aint very rich and we have no jobs for people, unemployment is our big issue. Everyone has to travel to bratislava to get a job, so basically people feel like they are not treated well so lets help our people and then help migrants, that's the basically logic why we didn't help Greece in first place.
